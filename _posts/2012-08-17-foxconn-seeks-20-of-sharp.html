<p><a href="http://cdn.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4394255/Hon-Hai-now-wants-20-percent-stake-in-Sharp">Junko Yoshida, EETimes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The Nikkei</em>, Japan&acirc;&euro;&trade;s economic journal, reported Friday (Aug. 17) that Foxconn owner Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. is now asking to double its planned stake in Sharp Corp. to about 20 percent from the originally agreed 9.9 percent.</blockquote></p>
<p>Sharp must have something quite valuable to Foxconn.</p>
