<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-6052 aligncenter" title="dell_p2210_22_inch_lcd_monitor_epeat_gold_energy_star" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/dell_p2210_22_inch_lcd_monitor_epeat_gold_energy_star.jpg" alt="dell_p2210_22_inch_lcd_monitor_epeat_gold_energy_star" width="300" height="312" /></p></p>
<p><strong>Green</strong> And if that wasn't enough: halogen-reduced laminates. Kudos to Dell for bringing out three very green LCD monitors: P2210 (pictured above), E190S, E170S. The E170S and E190S have a chassis composed of 25 percent post-consumer recycled plastics while the P2210 makes use of halogen-reduced materials.</p>
<p><strong>4:3?</strong> I'm looking at <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/05/14/dell-rolls-out-budget-eco-minded-p2210-e190s-e170s-monitors/">Engadget's site</a> and for some reason it states that the E190S and E170S are 4:3 models. Actually they are 5:4 models sporting a 1280 x 1024 pixel format. Anybody can make mistakes and this one is common.</p>
<p><strong>Budget Price</strong> The P2210 is a 22" (21.5" to be exact) monitor with a 16:10 aspect ratio featuring a 1680 x 1050 pixel format and three connections: VGA, DVI-D with HDCP, DisplayPort. Like UltraSharp models the P2210 also has USB connections--four of them. The 17" E170S and the 19" E190S sport only VGA connections but is targeted toward the eco-conscious budget-minded consumer at just $110 and $130 respectively. The slightly larger P2210 is priced at $240.</p>
<p><strong>Mercury</strong> I do have one gripe: the CCFL backlight in all three of these models have mercury. As we all know mercury is a big problem that is seeping into our food source especially large fish such as salmon and tuna. I would have liked to see these models sport LED backlights instead, even if that meant slightly higher upfront costs. With LED backlights mercury is eliminated and there are energy savings down the road. I wonder how you get an EPEAT Gold rating with stuff that has mercury in them...</p>
