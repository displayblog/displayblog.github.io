<p>Sanyo Epson has a strategy and it is called HCL-S. It stands for High quality, Compact design, Low power consumption and System solutions. True to that strategy, Sanyo Epson developed a 2.2" TFT LCD that is only 1.1mm thick. Brightness is 350 cd/m2 and pixel format is 320 x 240. Ultra-thin components such as the backlight, polarizers, glass substrates, etc. were used.</p>
<p>A RAZR half as thin. Sounds good to me, but with one caveat: Is it durable?</p>
