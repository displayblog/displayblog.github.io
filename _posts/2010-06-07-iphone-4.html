<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-10710 aligncenter" title="iPhone_4_Optical_Lamination" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/iPhone_4_Optical_Lamination.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="288" /></p><br />
<strong>Retina Display:</strong> Not surprisingly the pixel format on the 3.5-inch IPS TFT LCD <em>is</em> 960x640 (read <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/05/30/iphone-hd-960x640-confirmed/">iPhone HD: 960x640 Confirmed?</a>) making iPhone 4's display the highest resolution on the market today. The 326 PPI display will make ebook reading, web surfing and everything else that has text a significantly more enjoyable experience. The pixels are just 78 micrometers across and the human visual system cannot individually distinguish these little critters. Viewing angles have been improved and contrast ratio has quadrupled (to a static 800:1) compared to the iPhone 3GS so blacks are blacker, a good thing. The front glass cover is chemically strengthened so it is harder, less prone to scratches, and more durable. There's also an oil-resistant (oleophobic) coating to prevent oil from your fingers messing up the pretty display. The same hardened glass is used on the back too.</p>
<p><strong>No More Dust:</strong> A process called optical lamination was employed that laminates Corning's Gorilla cover glass directly on the display. This improves sharpness and clarity of the display by eliminating light refraction, which is caused by the small distance between the glass surface and the LCD that exists on pre-4 iPhones. Light refraction was a nuisance, but the major irritation was dust in the air between the glass and the LCD: there is nothing you can do once you spot dust but to stare at it in disgust. I'm glad this problem will be a thing of the past with iPhone 4.&Acirc;&nbsp;There is still the hardened glass cover between you and the LCD but the effect of optically laminating the cover glass should make the display feel much closer to you and result in a better optical and multitouch experience than previous iPhones. My guess is that you'll feel like you're really touching the actual content on the display.</p>
<p>After reading several pieces online regarding impressions of the display on iPhone 4 I think I will have to get my hands on one of these as soon as possible. Availability of iPhone 4 is June 24: US$199 for the 16GB version and $299 for 32GB. Oh, and I got the name completely wrong (read <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/03/30/iphone-hd/">iPhone HD</a>).</p>
