<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/03/ce-oh-no-he-didnt-facebooks-mark-zuckerberg-says-the-ipads/">Engadget</a> reports Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>... the iPad's not mobile... it's a computer.</blockquote></p>
<p>That was in response to a question about the possibility of a Facebook app for the iPad. I think a Facebook iPad app would be a great idea.</p>
