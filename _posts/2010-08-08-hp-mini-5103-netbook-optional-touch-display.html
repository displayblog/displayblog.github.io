<p>HP's Mini 5103 is the successor to the 5102 and is a 10.1-inch netbook geared toward business folks. Optional features include: up to 128GB SSD, Broadcom Crystal HD video accelerator, and a touch display. As far as I can tell the Mini 5103 isn't a convertible so my question is why would you want touch capabilities on a regular netbook?
