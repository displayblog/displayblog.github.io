<p>The HTC HD7 is a T-Mobile exclusive (in the US) and sports a massive 4.3-inch LCD, with a 800x480 pixel format. T-Mobile points out that the HTC HD7 is the largest Windows Phone 7 (WP7) launch smartphone. But larger doesn't always mean better. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/11/htc-hd7-first-hands-on/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The 4.3-inch screen is again framed by a minimal bezel, lending a feel of efficient, raw, electronic prowess, and it just feels bigger without the HD2's hardware buttons in the way. We were less impressed by the display's viewing angles, however -- maybe the recent spate of AMOLED, IPS, and Super LCD panels has spoiled us, but the color degradation as you move off center is really offputting. We appreciate that a 4.3-inch superscreen is probably beyond any reasonable manufacturing budgets, but the fact remains that the HD7's current screen feels a step behind the competition, both in terms of pixel density and general performance.</blockquote></p>
<p>I guess 'HD' can be slapped onto anything these days. The only thing I can think of that gives the HD7 name any credence is that it can capture 720p HD video.</p>
