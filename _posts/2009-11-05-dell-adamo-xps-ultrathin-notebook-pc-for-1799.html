  What this tells me is that Dell did not do a good enough job where it counts the

  overpriced. There is a cover glass that makes the 13.4-inch LCD quite glossy. "

<p><strong>Limited Viewing Angles:</strong> In a quick hands-on from Engadget, Ross Miller did note that the viewing angles were "somewhat restrictive". What this tells me is that Dell did not do a good enough job where it counts the most. Most users of the Adamo XPS will be spending the majority of their time looking at the LCD and not at the chassis, no matter how nice it looks. And when I hear things like limited viewing angles on a $1799 notebook PC, I automatically think overpriced. There is a cover glass that makes the 13.4-inch LCD quite glossy. <a id="more"></a><a id="more-7589"></a></p>
<p><strong>Touch Sensitive Case Latch:</strong> Miller also noted that he was concerned about the capacitive touch case latch. You need to slide your finger across it for the Adamo XPS to unlatch. Nice idea and probably came from some smartphone requiring you to slide your finger across to unlock it. But on a notebook that has a physical opening mechanism I think it's a waste of time. I don't think the capacitive touch sensor will break in any way since we have mobile phones that use this technology (think original <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=lg+chocolate&amp;sa=Search#1333">LG Chocolate</a>) that have been on the market for several years.</p>
<p><strong>2 Hours 36 Minutes:</strong> That's all you're going to get with the 20WHr Li-Ion battery. The optional 40WHr battery gets you 5 hours and 17 minutes but most likely it will add bulk and weight. There are dongles for VGA and HDMI. As you might have guessed there is no integrated optical drive. External optical drive options include a DVD+/-RW or Blu-ray.</p>
<p><strong>In Time For The Holidays:</strong> At this time there is no official launch date but I'm guessing you should be able to get one for Christmas. And when you do get one don't be surprised at how large and heavy the box is. If you were worried that the unusual-looking hinge placement might make computing on your lap uncomfortable, Miller states that "... it is indeed very comfortable in your lap..." He concludes by stating that the Adamo XPS "... is a quintessential aspirational product..." that people will buy for its unique form factor alone.</p>
