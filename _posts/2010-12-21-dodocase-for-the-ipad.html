<blockquote><p>The Dodocase is about as close to perfection as iPad cases get. The materials are beautiful, and the craftsmanship is spectacular.</blockquote></p>
<p>The <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=lbdpb9V9bvo&offerid=224732.10000009&type=3&subid=0" >DODOcase</a><img border=0 width=1 height=1 src="http://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=lbdpb9V9bvo&bids=224732.10000009&type=3&subid=0" /> (kickback link) is hand-crafted in San Francisco. I don't own an iPad, but if I did I would want a DODOcase to protect and adorn it.</p>
