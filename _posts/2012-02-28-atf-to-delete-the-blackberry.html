<p>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives CIO <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0212/73369.html">Rick Holgate</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&acirc;&euro;&trade;re going to delete the BlackBerry from the mix. [...] The government has been very comfortable with the BlackBerry model for 10 years. Now we're looking to move beyond that. [...] Video streaming, GPS capability, capabilities, the camera &acirc;&euro;&brvbar; a variety of things. Yes, these things exist on BlackBerrys, but in terms of ease of use and adaptability of the devices, the iPhones are the more functional and compelling use case.</blockquote></p>
