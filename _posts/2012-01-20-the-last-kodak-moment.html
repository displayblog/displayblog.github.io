<p><a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21542796">The Economist</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Film is a bit like skin: both contain collagen. Just as photos fade because of oxidation, cosmetics firms would like you to think that skin is preserved with anti-oxidants. In Fujifilm&acirc;&euro;&trade;s library of 200,000 chemical compounds, some 4,000 are related to anti-oxidants. So the company launched a line of cosmetics, called Astalift, which is sold in Asia and is being launched in Europe this year.</p>
<p>Fujifilm also sought new outlets for its expertise in film: for example, making optical films for LCD flat-panel screens. It has invested $4 billion in the business since 2000. And this has paid off. In one sort of film, to expand the LCD viewing angle, Fujifilm enjoys a 100% market share.</blockquote></p>
<p>Fascinating. And depressing that Kodak filed for bankruptcy.</p>
