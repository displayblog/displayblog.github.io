<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/letter-from-tim-cook-on-maps/">Apple</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>At Apple, we strive to make world-class products that deliver the best experience possible to our customers. With the launch of our new Maps last week, we fell short on this commitment. We are extremely sorry for the frustration this has caused our customers and we are doing everything we can to make Maps better.</blockquote></p>
<p>I've been lucky with Maps in iOS 6. Despite the frustratingly complex freeway system in Dallas, the new Maps app did a fine job of giving turn-by-turn directions to and from the hotel, downtown, and DFW.</p>
