<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20091215PD209.html">DIGITIMES</a>: Chunghwa Picture Tubes (CPT), a Taiwan-based display manufacturer, introduced its 21.5-inch LCD panel with capacitive touch technology. The LCD panel is not yet being mass produced but currently being evaluated by potential customers. The much much smaller capacitive touch-enabled 10.1-inch LCD panel is.</p>
<p>As capacitive touch technology is applied to larger and larger LCDs the experience of reaching out and touching your screen with multiple fingers will most likely become quite common not only on your smartphone but on notebook PCs, LCD monitors, all-in-ones, LCD TVs and even huge digital signage displays. Lag won't be an issue any more. I wonder if you can replace the 21.5-inch iMac LCD with this one...</p>
