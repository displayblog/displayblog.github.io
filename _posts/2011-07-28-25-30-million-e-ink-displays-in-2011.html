<blockquote><p>E Ink Holdings expects EPD shipments for e-book readers to increase more than 50% in the second half of 2011, and has upward adjusted its 2011 shipments projection from 20-30 million to 25-30 million, according to company chairman Scott Liu at an investors conference on July 28.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110708005437/en/Media-Tablet-Sales-Lag-Optimistic-Quarter-Targets">IDC</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For eBooks, Barnes & Noble's Color Nook helped the company to take the lead in the eReader market for the first time. Amazon's Kindle was second, but the lack of a color offering has clearly impacted the company's previous dominance in the eReader market. IDC forecasts the worldwide eReader market to ship 16.2 million units in 2011, a 24% increase over 2010.</blockquote></p>
<p>E Ink seems to be overly optimistic compared to IDC.</p>
<p>PS: Is the Nook Color an e-reader or a tablet? If you're willing to root it, at just US$249 it is the most affordable Android tablet you can buy today.</p>
