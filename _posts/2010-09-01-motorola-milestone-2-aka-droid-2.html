<p>I used to own a Motorola Motoroi and when I returned it I was so relieved. I didn't have to deal with the craziness that involved the Android smartphone self-rebooting about a dozen times a day. Was it Motorola's fault? Google? SK Telecom in Korea? Who knows. What I do know is that I'm not touching any smartphone from Motorola for quite some time. Read <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/07/10/sktelecom-motorola-xt720-motoroi-review-3-7-inch-ips-android-2-1-smartphone-in-south-korea/">the review</a>. Yes, I know it is irrational to generalize based on just one experience, but I tell you the experience was just too painful. Ranting aside...</p>
<p>The Motorola Milestone 2 is the Motorola Droid 2. I guess Droid can't be used outside of the US. Here's the skinny on the specs: 1GHz OMAP SOC, 512MB RAM, 5MP camera, 8GB internal storage, Android 2.2 (Froyo), Motoblur, and 720p video recording. Motoblur is unfortunate but 720p video recording is a major plus and about time. A faster CPU would have been appreciated. I wonder why there wasn't any mention of the display... Probably the same 3.7-inch LCD sporting a 854x480 pixel format found in the original Milestone/Droid.
