<p><a href="http://www.j-display.com/english/news/2014/20140423.html">Japan Display Inc. (JDI)</a>: On April 23, 2014 JDI announced the development of its 10.1-inch 4K Ultra HD (UHD) 3840x2160 LTPS IPS LCD panel with a resolution of 438 ppi. Last year it was a 12.1-inch 4K LCD. Here are the specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display Size: 10.07 inch / 25.58 cm</li>
<li>Display Mode: IPS</li>
<li>Color Gamut: 71% NTSC</li>
<li>Contrast Ratio: 1100:1 (typical)</li>
<li>Viewing Angles: 160/160+ (CR>100:1)</li>
<li>Brightness: 400 cd/m2 (typical)</li>
<li>Power Consumption: 2180 mW (1800 mW @ 400 cd/m2 backlight + 380 mW LCD panel)</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>One interesting observation are the viewing angles. LCD manufacturers usually try to maximize specification numbers by using viewing angles at a contrast ratio of greater than 10:1, but JDI is using greater than 100:1. I don't know for sure, but viewing angles with a contrast ratio greater than 10:1 could be 178/178, which is typical of most IPS LCDs.</p>
<p>I think it's safe to assume 10.1-inch 4K tablets are coming.</p>
