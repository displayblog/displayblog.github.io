<p>The official merge of Philips MDS into Toppoly Optoelectronics will happen June 5 according to the Chinese Commercial Times. TPO will become one of the top three manufacturers of small-medium TFT LCDs. The report says that the company&#39;s capacity will be more than 10 million units, but 10 million units of what? Small-medium can go all the way up to 9.9" in size and as small as just a couple of inches. Nonetheless, Toppoly will be ranked up there wish Samsung and AUO in small-medium TFT LCD panel production capacity.</p>
