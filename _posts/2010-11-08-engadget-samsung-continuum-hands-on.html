<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/08/samsung-continuum-first-hands-on/">Engadget</a>: The Samsung Continuum is unique among Android smartphones in that it has two displays: one main and the other small one for stuff like a ticker. Well, that's not true; it's actually one large 4-inch display.</p>
<blockquote><p>The entire front of the phone is one huge four-inch screen, with the Android buttons more or less painted over the lower third -- the screen lights up underneath them in white to illuminate them. Samsung says it's just easier for marketing purposes to say it's two screens, but that they're selectively turning on the bottom portion of the display for the ticker.</blockquote></p>
<p>Lying for marketing purposes. Wonderful.</p>
