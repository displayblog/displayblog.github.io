  Logic</a> introduced its electronic newspaper reader. What's so unique about
  it? Well, it's big, much bigger than Amazon's <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=kindle\">Kindle</a>
  or <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sony\">Sony</a>'s <a
  href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=prs-505\">PRS-505</a>. The
  dimensions are about as large as a regular piece of paper at 8.5\" x 11\". The e-paper
  reader is quite thin as you can see in the picture. I like the big format and I
  hope that means a lot of pixels, way more than the aforementioned e-book readers.

<p>What formats can you read on it? Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDFs. Hopefully newspapers, magazines and books will all become digitized so we can stop chopping down paper, wasting transportation costs to deliver all of these and then dumping all of them and creating havoc on the environment. Of course, I'm sure, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=e-ink">E Ink</a> technology isn't 100% environmentally friendly, but I would guess that it's less hazardous than the paper version. E Ink's bi-stable <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=electronic-paper-display">electronic paper display</a> technology is what is behind Plastic Logic's electronic newspaper reader. The good thing about this technology is that it doesn't require any power when the display is not being updated. Since I tend to reread portions of highly intellectual writings, I won't be using any power stuck on that page.&Acirc;&nbsp;When is it going to ship? In 1H'09, and that's pretty soon since we've got only 3 1/2 months left in the year.</p>
