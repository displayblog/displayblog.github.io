<p><a href="http://us.leica-camera.com/Company/Press-Centre/Press-Releases/Photokina-2014/Press-Release-The-essence-of-photography-the-LEICA-M-Edition-60-Special-edition-for-the-60th-anniversary-of-the-Leica-M-rangefinder-system">Leica</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reduced to only the essential camera features, the Leica M Edition 60 is the first digital camera to concentrate exclusively on the bare functions required for digital photography &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; shutter speed, aperture, focusing and ISO sensitivity. This is also the reason for the replacement of the camera&acirc;&euro;&trade;s display with an ISO selector dial. For reasons of quality, exposures are saved as raw data in DNG format. Working with the Leica M Edition 60 intentionally demands the same care and attention as working with an analogue model. Only the sensor and the entire electronics reflect the state of the art of contemporary camera technology.</blockquote></p>
<p>Digital technology. Analogue experience.</p>
