The Samsung I7500 will be available in major European countries from June 2009. There are two fantastic features of the I7500: one is hardware and the other is software.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=oled&amp;sa=Search#1500"><strong>OLED</strong></a> The I7500 sports a 3.2" touch-enabled AMOLED (Active Matrix OLED) display. OLEDs are great for their great colors, power savings and extreme thinness. The OLED display sports a 320 x 480 pixel format, which is what you find on Apple's iPhone. But the iPhone is a TFT LCD so most likely photos, videos and everything else will look much better on the I7500.</p>

But I do get excited about Android, Google's open source operating system for smartphones (and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/04/27/netbook-20/">Netbook 2.0</a>). Samsung's I7500 will be the second major smartphone to make use of Android and that should prompt some of you out there to start drooling. I am not sure if the I7500 will feature a slide-out QWERTY keyboard like T-Mobile's G1.</p>
<p><strong>8GB</strong> Unlike most other smartphones (with the iPhone being an exception) the I7500 comes with plenty of storage space: 8GB. And unlike the iPhone it has a MicroSD card slot that can add an additional 32GB.</p>
<p>The touch OLED, Android, Samsung combination will be a potent competitor in the race to be the ultimate smartphone. Availability in the US has not been announced for the I7500 but I'm hoping Samsung will decide to ship it here in the same month of June.</p>
