<p>Chris Welch, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/28/4040348/google-cfo-products-in-motorola-pipeline-arent-wow-by-google-standards">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Google's Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President Patrick Pichette today said that products in Motorola's pipeline are "not really to the standards that what Google would say is wow &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; innovative, transformative."</blockquote></p>
<p>Perhaps a good kick in the butt will get Motorola going again.</p>
<p><em>Update 2013.04.16:</em> Shara Tibken, <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57579814-94/eric-schmidt-motorolas-new-products-are-phenomenal/">c|net</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"What I'd advise to do with Motorola is wait and see with the next generation of technology," Schmidt said. "It's very, very impressive."</blockquote></p>
<p>Less than two months ago Pichette wasn't impressed with what Motorola had in the pipeline. Now Schmidt is very impressed. Which is it? <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/06/06/happy-android-first-day">Schmidt can at times exaggerate</a> so I'll go with Pichette.</p>
