<blockquote><p>Combining ergonomic technology with sleek aesthetics, the Keyboard Buddy Case is a protective backing for your Apple iPhone 4 that also includes an integrated slide-out Bluetooth keyboard. The low-profile keyboard slides out smoothly, allowing you to easily transition between the Apple iPhone 4&acirc;&euro;&trade;s touch screen and a physical keyboard.</blockquote></p>
<p>The slideout Bluetooth QWERTY keyboard needs to be recharged, separately, using a USB cable. According to BoxWave the keyboard lasts 45 days. For folks that absolutely need a physical keyboard but cannot imagine living without the iPhone this solution looks quite good. But it is pricey: US$69.95.</p>
