<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20121226PD220.html">DIGITIMES</a>: According to industry sources, of course. Apple is reportedly <em>further</em> evaluating IGZO-based displays for the iPhone, iPad mini, and iPad in 2013. It's not just Sharp at its Gen. 8 Kameyama No. 2 line, which commenced the production of IGZO LCDs in March 2012 and mass production a month later; AU Optronics (AUO) has its L5C line, too. Innolux may have also licensed IGZO from Sharp and manufacture IGZO LCDs on its Gen. 3 and Gen. 5 lines. So, potentially there's three IGZO LCD suppliers in 2013: Sharp, AUO, and Innolux. But there might be more. Back on July 20, 2011 <a href="http://www.jst.go.jp/pr/announce/20110720-2/index_e.html">Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) licensed patents related to IGZO to Samsung Electronics</a>, but doesn't mean Samsung is ready to mass manufacture IGZO LCDs. We will have to wait and see. But why IGZO? Imagine a retina iPad mini that's thinner, lighter, and with a battery life exceeding 12 hours. Now that's the iPad mini I'd want.</p>
