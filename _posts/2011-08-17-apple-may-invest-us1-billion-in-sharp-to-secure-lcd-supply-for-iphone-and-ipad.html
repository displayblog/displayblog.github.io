<p>Mayumi Negishi, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/17/us-sharp-apple-factory-idUSTRE77G0GK20110817">Reuters</a>:</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since late last year, Japanese media have reported that Apple may invest around 100 billion yen ($1.3 billion) in the Sharp plant, but Sharp's shares outperformed the market on Wednesday after brokerage MF Global FXA Securities highlighted the likelihood of the investment in a sales note.</p><br />

<p>MF Global FXA Securities analyst David Rubenstein:</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We think it is highly possible that Apple will make an investment in Sharp's Kameyama plant to the tune of around $1 billion in order to secure a stable supply of screens for iPhones and iPads.</p><br />
