<p><a href="http://winsupersite.com/windows-8/what-heck-happening-windows">Paul Thurrott</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The reason this happened is that while Sinofsky had the maniacal power and force of will of a Steve Jobs, he lacked Jobs' best gift: An innate understanding of good design. Windows 8 is not well-designed. It's a mess. But Windows 8 is a bigger problem than that. Windows 8 is a disaster in every sense of the word.</p>
<p>This is not open to debate, is not part of some cute imaginary world where everyone's opinion is equally valid or whatever. Windows 8 <em>is</em> a disaster. Period.</p>
<p>While some Windows backers took a wait-and-see approach and openly criticized me for being honest about this, I had found out from internal sources immediately that the product was doomed from the get-go, feared and ignored by customers, partners and other groups in Microsoft alike. Windows 8 was such a disaster that Steven Sinofsky was ejected from the company and his team of lieutenants was removed from Windows in a cyclone of change that triggered a reorganization of the entire company. Even Sinofsky's benefactor, Microsoft's then-CEO Steve Ballmer, was removed from office. Why did all this happen? Because together, these people set the company and Windows back by years and have perhaps destroyed what was once the most successful software franchise of all time.</blockquote></p>
<p>I like Windows 7 better.</p>
