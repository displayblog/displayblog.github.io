<p>Apple spokesperson Trudy Muller <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2011/03/14/apple-says-demand-for-ipad-2-is-amazing/">The Loop</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Demand for the next generation iPad 2 has been amazing. We are working hard to get iPad 2 into the hands of every customer who wants one as quickly as possible.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/14/us-apple-research-idUSTRE72D30020110314">Reuters</a> is reporting Apple might have sold 1,000,000 iPad 2s this past weekend. Apple is sold out of iPad 2s. As of this writing you'll need to wait 3-4 weeks for your shiny new iPad 2, if you order one, right now. Who knows how long the wait will be tomorrow.</p>
<p>For me, I've decided to wait. There are a few things I just can't live with: I need a good camera and the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?s=ipad+camera+sucks">crappy camera</a> on the back just won't cut it. After getting used to the amazing display quality on the iPhone 4, I need a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?s=ipad+retina+display">Retina Display</a> on my iPad. In the meantime I'll be making good use of my iPhone 4 and patiently waiting for the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/02/10/ipad-3/">iPad 3</a>.</p>
