<p>Brian Heater, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/07/19/iriver-story-hd-review/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The display has 768 x 1024 resolution -- that's higher than the Kindle and Nook's industry-standard 600 x 800. The result is undeniably sharp, but given the fact that most readers will be using the device primarily to view pages comprised entirely of text, it's hard to imagine that making a huge difference in the lives of most of its users.</blockquote></p>
<p>The iRiver Story HD has a higher resolution of 213 ppi, versus 167 on the others. That's the whole point: a better reading experience through sharper text.</p>
