<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/11/5199886/qualcomm-toq-review">Chris Ziegler, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But boy, is Mirasol great for a smartwatch. Technologically, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s sort of a hybrid between DLP and LCD, and offers many of the benefits of E Ink without any of its disadvantages. It becomes even more readable in bright ambient light, which is why Qualcomm has occasionally marketed Mirasol as <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/1/10/2697061/qualcomm-color-mirasol-ereader-hanvon">a compelling option for e-readers</a>.</p>
<p>The Toq's capacitive touchscreen never turns off, because like E Ink, it draws effectively no power when it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not changing states &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; you can glance at it and always know that you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll see the time without having to press a button or perform any wrist gymnastics.</p>
<p>Where Mirasol really wins, though, is on refresh rate: screens change instantaneously, with no more delay to the naked eye than an LCD. The Toq also offers full color, and it ships with some pretty beautiful watch faces to take advantage of it.</blockquote></p>
<p>I'm not sure if &acirc;&euro;&oelig;full color&acirc;&euro; is an accurate description. The colors are washed out and when compared to other display technologies such as LCD and OLED the term &acirc;&euro;&oelig;full color&acirc;&euro; is probably not a term you would use to describe the colors on the Toq's Mirasol display. A super high resolution grayscale display might have been a better choice for smartwatch applications. It's pretty simple, really: Make a smartwatch look just like the <a href="http://www.bellross.com/us/collections/aviation/br_01/#/1/">Bell & Ross BR 01-92</a>, but with all sorts of sensors working in the background. Double-tap the display and you get access to a treasure trove of movement, sleep, health analytics.</p>
