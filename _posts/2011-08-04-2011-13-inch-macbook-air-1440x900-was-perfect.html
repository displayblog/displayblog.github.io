<p>David Martin, <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/fourteen-days-with-apples-powerful-ultra-portable-13-inch-macbook-air-review/107227">Cult of Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The screen resolution 1440&Atilde;&mdash;900 was perfect for my needs and matches that of a 15-inch MacBook Pro. It was crisp and clear. I had no problems using it for lengthy periods of time and I never saw any reason to attach the computer to an external display. I seldom do that with any portable computer I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve ever owned. After all a portable is a portable. I always thought that tying a display to a portable computer was akin to adding a boat anchor onto it. I prefer a separate desktop like my iMac instead.</blockquote></p>
<p>I like the idea of having one computer fill all of my needs. That's probably why I gave up some mobility and went with a 17-inch MacBook Pro. I split the 1920x1200 pixel format into two 960x1200 windows and work as if I had two monitors.</p>
<p>I'd rather not juggle a 13-inch MacBook Air and an iMac. The thought of maintaining two computers isn't appealing. A docking station where I slide in a MacBook to gain access to a 27-inch display sounds compelling though.</p>
