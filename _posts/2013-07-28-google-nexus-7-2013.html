<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/26/4558626/google-nexus-7-review-2013">David Pierce</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For me, a good display is the most important feature of a tablet. I don't need a hugely specialized set of apps&mdash;I play some games, but don't consider any one to be mission-critical&mdash;I just need a tablet that makes books and movies look awesome. That's the new Nexus 7 in a nutshell, thanks to its new 7.02-inch, 1920 x 1200 IPS display. Google says it's the sharpest 7-inch tablet ever (at 323ppi it's hard to argue otherwise), but I'd put this screen up against anything from the iPad to the Nexus 10. It has bright, vivid colors without being oversaturated; the viewing angles are ridiculous; and text, photos, and 1080p Netflix looks incredible. Even the Google Play magazines, which are just shoddy PDFs of <em>Esquire</em> and <em>Better Homes and Gardens</em>, are completely readable at their tiny default sizes.</blockquote></p>
<p>The improved Nexus 7, a solid retina-caliber tablet for US$229, is an excellent deal.</p>
