<p>The keyboard is spill resistant for all those times when we're trying to gulf down lunch while in front of the computer. And just in case you drop your BZ notebook while taking it out of the computer bag for a security check, don't worry, the HDD should be okay since it is shock protected.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=15.4"">15.4"</a> LCD is a standard size but with a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led-backlight">LED backlight</a>, which is better for the environment (no mercury). The LED backlight also makes the enclosure thinner and saves a bit of energy. The price of just $1000 sounds very tempting.</p>
<p>The entire press release regarding the VAIO BZ notebook PCs:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>NEW SONY PROFESSIONAL NOTEBOOK LINE MEANS BUSINESS<br />
