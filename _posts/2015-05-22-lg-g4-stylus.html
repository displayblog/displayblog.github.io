<p>According to <a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/newsroom/contents/65304">LG</a> the 5.7-inch G4 Stylus sports a resolution of 258 ppi, which translates to a pixel format of 1280x720. Kudos to LG for adding a stylus, but that anemic screen is a deal breaker.</p>
<p>LG G4, LG G4 Stylus, LG G4c...</p>
<p>Why do most hardware brands believe an entire lineup is necessary for success? I don't know how many smartphones LG makes, but I do know the company makes too many. Apple has already shown one is enough, though it is on the wrong path at the moment with three. With one iPhone Apple grabbed the smartphone world by its throat, smashed it upside down, and took all of the profits.</p>
<p>LG, do what Apple did: bring your best industrial designers, hardware engineers, software engineers, user experience designers, photographers, deal makers, etc. and build one smartphone. Design for people, not the bank account, and do it every year.</p>
