<p><a href="http://www.isuppli.com/Teardowns-Manufacturing-and-Pricing/News/Pages/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-Carries-$205-Bill-of-Materials-iSuppli-Teardown-Reveals.aspx">iSuppli</a> did a teardown on the Samsung Galaxy Tab and found the LMS700JF03 by Samsung Mobile Display (SMD) in it. The 7-inch LCD is LED backlit, sports a 1024x600 pixel format for a resolution of 169 PPI. The LED backlight is edge-lit and packs 24 white LEDs. The capacitive touch layer is not integrated into the LCD. The total cost for both the touch layer and LCD? Just US$57. That's quite a bit less than the $98 iSuppli estimated for the iPad's 9.7-inch IPS LCD packing 1024x768 pixels.</p>
