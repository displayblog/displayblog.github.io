  them into a neater pile. From the neater pile you can flip through the media objects
  as if turning the pages on a book. You can also use two fingers to fan the media
  objects out. Double tap the pile and it will open up in a grid, which you can change
  the size of with two fingers. "

BumpTop is a "fun, intuitive <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=3d&amp;sa=Search">3D</a> desktop that keeps you organized and makes you more productive. Like a real desk, but better. Now with awesome mouse and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=multitouch&amp;sa=Search">multi-touch</a> gestures!" I think the power of BumpTop is the ability to directly manipulate media objects on the screen to Organize and Visualize. The multitouch gestures are quite intuitive and you should be comfortable moving media objects around in no time.</p>
<p><strong>Organize &amp; Visualize</strong> In the video above you can use the side of your finger to shove media objects into a pile. You can also use all five fingers to scrunch them into a neater pile. From the neater pile you can flip through the media objects as if turning the pages on a book. You can also use two fingers to fan the media objects out. Double tap the pile and it will open up in a grid, which you can change the size of with two fingers. <a id="more"></a><a id="more-7222"></a></p>
<p><strong>USB Key</strong> I liked how an USB key icon dropped into the 3D desktop when it was plugged in. Copying media objects into the USB key is as simple as dragging them and then dropping them on top of the USB key icon. Just like with a mouse but now with your finger. Want to have a look inside the USB key? Make a circle around the icon, wait for a pop-up menu, and touch "Expand To Pile". On top of the USB key icon will appear a pile of media objects. Double tap the pile and you get a nice grid with all of the media objects inside.</p>
<p>There were some photo cropping, sending photos to FaceBook and email as well but I think BumpTop will make it a lot of fun to organize media objects, especially photos. The company should rename this 3D multitouch desktop skin as PhotoBump.</p>
<p><a href="http://bumptop.com/download.php">You can download a free version of BumpTop</a> but that means you'll need to deal with some limitations: just 2 sticky notes, thumbnail previews are watermarked and there is limited customer support. If you're okay with that make sure you have at least 1GB of RAM and Windows XP. The CPU and GPU requirements are minimal. If you want multitouch, make sure you have installed <a href="http://windowsteamblog.com/blogs/windows7/archive/2009/02/12/enabling-multi-touch-in-the-windows-7-beta.aspx">Windows 7 touch hardware support</a> and hardware that supports more than 2 touchpoints. Mac and Linux users are out of luck.</p>
