<p><a href="http://stratechery.com/2013/understanding-google/">Ben Thompson</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>So, now that Android is good enough on phones, there simply isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t any point in investing in it as heavily as before.</blockquote></p>
<p>By no means is Android perfect; there are still a lot of things that need to be improved, such as scrolling. But Thompson makes a good point: Android is good enough on smartphones compared to iOS on the iPhone. When iOS first debuted it was a fast-moving target, but more recently iOS development velocity has dwindled and allowed Android to catch up for the most part. I haven't played with the beta version of iOS 7, but I don't think it will be a significant leap ahead of Android when it becomes available to the public later this year. Google will need to continue advancing Android on smartphones, but not as rapidly as it has so far. (Android on tablets is another story.)</p>
