<p><a href="http://www.cameratechnica.com/2011/06/16/the-science-of-image-stabilization-technology/">Camera Technica</a>: Preston Scott, the guy behind Camera Technica, shows how image stabilization works. Scott took off the front element of a Canon 18-55mm lens and filmed the floating lens element. So <em>this</em> is how in-lens image stabilization works. A must-read, and view.</p>
