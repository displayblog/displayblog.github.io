<p>The definition of the word &acirc;&euro;&tilde;biased&acirc;&euro;&trade; according to the dictionary app on my Mac:</p>
<blockquote><p>unfairly prejudiced for or against someone or something</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/24/6834955/vlad-reviews">Vlad Savov</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As exciting and fun as my work often is, however, it can also prove dispiriting and exasperating when I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m accused of being biased. <em>Of course</em> I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m biased, that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the whole point. We all have preferences and partialities that accrue over our lifetimes and become embedded in our judgment of anything new.</blockquote></p>
<p>I do not think you want to be biased, because being biased means you are unfair and prejudiced. And just to be certain we are talking about the same thing, according to the same dictionary, prejudice is defined as:</p>
<blockquote><p>preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience</blockquote></p>
<p>Being biased, unfair, prejudiced... all are things we do not want to be. I believe Savov does not want to be characterized as being those things either. Savov made an error: incorrectly thinking being biased is the same thing as having a preference. We all have preferences, but we are not all biased.</p>
