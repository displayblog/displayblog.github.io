<p>Image from <a href="http://www.vogue.co.uk/beauty/2012/01/31/minimalism---spring-summer-2012-natural-beauty-trend">Vogue UK</a>. <a href="http://minimalissimo.com/2012/02/minimalistic-beauty-trends">Marina Esmeraldo</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Natural-looking, or &acirc;&euro;&oelig;nude&acirc;&euro;¬ù make-up (as opposed to non-existant) often consists of a neutral color palette of taupes and browns and a flawless skin-base. For recent Spring/Summer 2012 fashion shows at Proenza Schouler, Missoni and Peter Pilotto, the make-up artists even dismissed the use of mascara for women&acirc;&euro;&trade;s eyelashes, leaving the eyes bare.</blockquote></p>
<p>I am a minimalist in training. I believe by striping away everything superflous you get to the bare, pure thing. I like simple designs as you can see from this WordPress theme I wrote from the ground up. The purpose of DisplayBlog is to share what I think is good; if something gets in the way of that I'll take it off.</p>
<p>I almost never write about makeup, but I thought this trend toward nude makeup warranted a mention because I have long preferred women express their natural beauty with as little makeup as possible. This trend connects well with my minimalistic leanings. I hope it lasts.</p>
