<p>Human LCD it is. Here is a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jgkm2pdWgY">YouTube video</a> of some incredible cheering by some of South Korea's high schools, not by holding up cards but by using their clothes with near-perfect coordination. The video fast-forwarded in some parts but still... ridiculously amazing.</p>
