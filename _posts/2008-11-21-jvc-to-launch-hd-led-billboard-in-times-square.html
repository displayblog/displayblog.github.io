<p>The JVC HD LED billboard was manufactured by Clear Channel Spectacolor in coordination with D3 LED, ArtFX Murals and North Shore Neon Sign. JVC shared some fun facts including that they've maintained a continuous presence in Times Square since 1979: quite a long time. This LED billboard is JVC's third in Times Square. The first one? Installed in 1979 at 1552 Broadway on the I. Miller building on the northeast corner of Broadway and 46th Street. The second one? Installed in 1999 at 1500 Broadway on the northeast corner of Broadway and 43rd Street, the same location where the third one will go.</p>
