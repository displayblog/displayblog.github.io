<p>Dell's Studio 15 series of notebook PCs look quite nice for a Dell. Take another look at the picture and you'll see simple purposeful lines without the "let's add another button for this" type of design that you typically see on Dell products. The Dell Studio 1555 is available in Singapore and the price is quite nice at about US$1000. There is much to like but what I do not like is the pisant 15.6" LCD panel: has a limited 1366 x 768 pixel format. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/02/24/dell-studio-15-with-hd-screen-and-mobility-radeon-hd-4570-graphi/">Engadget's Nilay Patel states</a> that you can "actually watch some of that high-def media at an appropriate res." I don't know if the 1555 comes with a Blu-ray drive but most likely not for that price. 1366 x 768 will only allow you watch 720p HD. Scaled at that. To me this isn't an appropriate res for watching HD content. I'll pay $100 extra for a 1920 x 1080 LCD, if the option exists. And that's the res I want to watch HD on.</p>
