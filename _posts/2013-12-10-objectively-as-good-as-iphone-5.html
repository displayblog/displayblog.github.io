<blockquote><p>Woodside also touched on the Moto G during the interview, saying that the device came out of a specific challenge: "How do we create a phone that's objectively as good as iPhone 5 for a third of the cost." Woodside said that technology costs have gotten low enough where that's possible. "That's what we did with Moto G," he tells Brownlee.</blockquote></p>
<p>Dennis Woodside is CEO of Motorola Mobility. The Moto G is objectively as good as iPhone 5? Subjectively speaking, I don't think so. But if Woodside really thinks it is, Motorola will run into bumpy roads ahead.</p>
