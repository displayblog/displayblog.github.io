<p><a href="http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20081015/159583/">Tech On</a> &rarr; <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5063527/lg-shows-off-19+inch-oled-panel">Gizmodo</a>: The <a href="http://www.imid.or.kr/">8th International Meeting on Information Display</a> (IMID) is being held in Korea from October 13 to 17. At IMID, LG Display showcased a 19" OLED display.</p>
<p>From the picture, the 19" OLED display from LPL seems to sport a regular aspect ratio of a 19" TFT LCD at 5:4. The pixel format is unknown, but if it turned out to be 1280x1024, I wouldn't be surprised. However, the interesting thing is that with almost all LCD monitors shifting to wide, a 19" wide OLED display would have had a bit more pizazz.</p>
<p>What is really interesting about LPL's 19" OLED display is that it uses an a-Si (amorphous silicon) TFT backpane. This is significant: with a-Si TFT LCD backpanes size can be scaled for OLED. And that means bigger OLED displays should be coming, at the very least in prototype forms in the near future. I am still quite pessimistic that much larger OLED displays can be mass produced and last as long as LCDs and come in at less than 2x the price in the next 5 years.</p>
