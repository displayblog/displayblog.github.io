<p>Samsung announced the world's first LCD using the DisplayPort video interface on July 25, 2007. DisplayPort is a next-generation interconnect that might replace VGA, DVI, LVDS and even HDMI. With DisplayPort, the 30" LCD with a pixel format of 2560 x 1600 without any performance degradations as the graphics data bandwidth is more than double the fastest interfaces today at 10.8Gbps. Apple's 30" Cinema HD display requires a dual-link DVI connection. With Samsung&acirc;&euro;&trade;s new LCD only a single DisplayPort interface is required leading to smaller, simpler and eventually cheaper connections. Samsung worked closely with Genesis Microchip to develop a 4-lane, 2.7Gbps/lane interface chip that can process 2560 x 1600 pixels at 10-bit color depths. This single DisplayPort interface with that kind of capability would have required three DVI or four LVDS interface chips according to Samsung. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;We are pleased to be the first LCD manufacturer in the world to create a panel with a DisplayPort interface. We have received many inquiries from computer integrators interested in DisplayPort-based LCD panels, which prompted an acceleration of our R&amp;D for this first DisplayPort LCD panel,&acirc;&euro;¬ù said Brian Berkeley, Vice President, Samsung LCD Business, who is leading the company&acirc;&euro;&trade;s DisplayPort development efforts. Mass production of the 30" DisplayPort panel is scheduled to begin in the Q2'08</p>
