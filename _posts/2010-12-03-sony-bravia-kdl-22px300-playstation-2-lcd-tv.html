<blockquote><p>The Sony Bravia KDL-22PX300 is a 22in LCD TV with a built-in PS2, which allows users to play classic games and watch DVDs. Old Playstation titles still play in standard definition but the 720p TV has four HDMI slots, includes a built-in Freeview tuner and an Ethernet port for internet video. With an additional dongle, it can go online wirelessly. It also has three USB sockets, plus Scart, VGA and component-video connectors.</blockquote></p>
<p>1366x768 would be the pixel format. Priced at <&Acirc;&pound;200. This is an odd combination: old school PS2 with a new-tech display. Unfortunately most LCDs don't have fast-enough response times to play games without motion blur. Plasma would have been better. But the best would have been a tube. Just imagine: a wide 22-inch CRT TV with an integrated PS2. Of course, it would be a slim CRT.</p>
