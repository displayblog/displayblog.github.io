<p><a href="http://blog.jilion.com/2010/02/11/sublimevideo-supports-firefox">Jilion</a>: SublimeVideo is probably one of the most exciting developments in HTML5 for video playback. In the last post (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/02/01/sublimevideo-html5-video-player/">SublimeVideo HTML5 Video Player</a></em>) I was amazed at the stutter-free video playback on Chrome and Safari. Now you can experience the same amazing Flash-free video on Firefox.</p>
