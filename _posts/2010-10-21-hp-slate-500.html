<p>The HP Slate 500 is official according to <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/21/hp-slate-finally-finally-official-rings-up-at-799/">Engadget</a>. Here are the specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>8.9-inch capacitive touch TFT LCD with 1024x600</li>
<li>Wacom digitizer for taking notes.<br />
</li>
<li>Windows 7 Professional</li></p>
<li>1.86GHz Intel Atom Z540</li>
<li>Broadcom Crystal HD for 1080p video playback.</li>
<li>2GB DDR2 RAM, 64GB SSD, WiFi BGN<br />
</li>
<li>Front-facing 640x480 camera, rear-facing 3 megapixel camera</li></p>
<li>1.5 pounds</li>
<li>US$799<br />
</li></ul></p>
<p>There is also a dock (HDMI, 2x USB, headphone), a SD card slot, an internal microphone and a "keyboard button". I expect the keyboard button is needed because Windows 7 wouldn't know exactly when you would want the keyboard or not. iDevices also have a keyboard button but it is in the the apps themselves.</p>
<p>A Ctrl+Alt+Del key, a must have: it is after all a Windows machine. Unfortunately there is no slot for the Wacom digitizer, but the included case does. Onboard is a 3G mobile broadband Gobi 2000 module, which means that the Slate 500 could theoretically hop onto both GSM/CDMA data networks.</p>

<p>The back has an interesting triangular rubbery texture that should prevent it from sliding around. It is probably is easier to grip than glass or aluminum.</p>
<p>The HP Slate 500 is basically a touch-enabled Windows 7 netbook without the keyboard. I can see this being used as a very expensive notepad for those who would rather write longhand than type. But wouldn't HP's own <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/27/hp-touchsmart-tm2t-12-1-inch-convertible-tablet-pc/">TouchSmart tm2t</a> or <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/02/28/hp-elitebook-2740p-12-1-inch-capacitive-multitouch-convertible-tablet/">EliteBook 2740p</a> convertibles be better keyboarded alternatives? You are going to get a Bluetooth keyboard for the Slate 500, right?</p>
