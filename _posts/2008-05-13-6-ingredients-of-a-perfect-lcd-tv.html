<p>Perfect meaning a perfect <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a> for you! Since I love food, allow me to make a food analogy. While there are many common characteristics about world-renowned chefs, I would like to concentrate on their use of the best ingredients to create their dishes.  In the movie No Reservations, Catherine Zeta-Jones stars as a perfectionist master chef Kate Armstrong who runs her kitchen at a trendy Manhattan eatery. To perfect her creations she always wakes up very early in the morning, strolls through the dock and pays a premium for fresh fish. </p>

<p>Fresh ingredients are essential. We see something similar in Pixar&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Ratatouille where extra cash payments are made for the best ingredients. Much like cooking, the best ingredients are part of a great LCD TV. The best LCD TV brands use top ingredients to manufacturer their best LCD TV creations. Some ingredients exact a substantial premium in price but it can be worth it. To pick the best LCD TV you need to know what the ingredients are. There are six important ingredients that make exceptional LCD TVs. The better these ingredients the better your experience will be when you take delivery of your LCD TV, install it, connect it and watch your first high-definition video. In the course of the next few weeks, I will go through each ingredient in detail. The ingredients are:</p>

<li>Technologies to reduce motion blur on LCD TVs: <strong><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/05/16/6-ingredients-of-a-perfect-lcd-tv-120hz-or-faster/">120Hz</a></strong>, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led">LED</a> Backlight, Black Frame Insertion, Motion Interpolation, Fast Response Time, Over Driving Circuitry.</li>
<li>Technologies to increase contrast ratio: LED Backlight and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=local-dimming">Local Dimming</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=full-hd">Full HD</a> or <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1080p">1080p</a>: LCD panels with a pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a>.</li>
<li>Enhanced Color Gamut: LCD panels with >72% NTSC color gamut using RGB LED Backlight or <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=wide-color-gamut">Wide Color Gamut</a> CCFL.</li>
<li>Video Inputs: <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=hdmi">HDMI</a>, DVI, VGA, Composite, Component and what all of these mean.</li>
<li>Sexiness: Like a car, your gut instinct needs to really like how it looks turned on and off, within a budget, of course.</li><br />
</ol><br />
The list is not exhaustive, but a good understanding of these technologies will hopefully give you enough knowledge to go out and bring home that perfect LCD TV you've been dreaming of. Of course, it doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t matter how good your LCD TV is if you don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t feed it good quality high-definition video. Remember the old adage in computer programming? Garbage in, garbage out. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not quite the same since some LCD TVs have the capability to enhance the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;garbage&acirc;&euro;¬ù and make it somewhat palatable, but so far it seems best to let a dedicated machine de-interlace and up-convert. Expect some helpful, educational and hopefully entertaining articles regarding the <strong>6 Ingredients of a Perfect LCD TV</strong> in the next few weeks.</p>
