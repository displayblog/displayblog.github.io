<p><a href="http://explore.toshiba.com/laptops/qosmio/X305/X305-Q708">Toshiba</a>: The Qosmio X305-Q708 and X305-Q706 notebook PCs were unveiled on November 6, 2008. These Qosmio notebook PCs are a world's first in that they sport three GPUs. The GPUs are all from NVIDIA and include one GeForce 9400M and two GeForce 9800M GTS GPUs. This is an evolution of the hybrid SLI GPU design that has become trendy thanks to Apple bringing the concept to the fore with its recently introduced MacBook Pro notebook PCs. The 9400M is used for "quiet operation" while the two ultra-powerful 9800M GPUs are used for "maximum performance".&Acirc;&nbsp;Toshiba America Information System's VP of Product Development, Carl Pinto described the new Qosmio units as an "extreme-performance gaming machine". More analysis and pictures after the jump.</p>
<p>The only letdown of the X305-Q708 is the 17-inch LCD. The pixel format is limited to just 1680x1050. I don't know why Toshiba chose not to go with the best: 1920x1200. There are many games out there that look absolutely fantastic at 1920x1200. With this trio of GPUs the X305-Q708 could have easily run Crysis at playable FPS with nearly all of the high quality settings on.</p>
<p>Another important component in revving up FPS in playing games is the performance of the HDD subsystem. The X305 does not disappoint: the main OS (Vista Ultimate) is stored in a 128GB SSD while the big media files (along with applications) go on the 320GB 7200RPM HDD. Start selling everything you've got on eBay or Craigslist since you'll need to save up a big sum of money to get the X305-Q708; it is priced at $4199.99!</p>
