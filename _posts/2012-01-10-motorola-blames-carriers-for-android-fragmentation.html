<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://512pixels.net/moto-blame-carriers-for-android-fragmentation/">Stephen Hackett</a>. In Chris Ziegler's interview with Motorola Mobility CEO <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/1/10/2697939/motorolas-sanjay-jha-verizon-and-at-t-dont-want-seven-stock-android">Sanjay Jha</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We also talked about OEMs' perennial press to skin the operating system &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; a trend that looks poised to continue in Android 4.0 &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; which developed into a full-blown conversation about the conflict between the mythical "stock Android device" and the realities of business between manufacturers like Motorola and carriers. "Verizon and AT&T don't want seven stock ICS devices on their shelves," he said, insisting that he "has to make money" and that there simply isn't a way to profit on a device that isn't differentiated. "The vast majority of the changes we make to the OS are to meet the requirements that carriers have."</blockquote></p>
<p>Carriers might be responsible, but OEMs are to blame as well, for lacking balls. A nobody in the smartphone space completely eradicated carrier crapware, banished ridiculous carrier logos, and took complete control over OS updates, back in 2007.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> In an interview with Lauren Goode, Google executive chairman <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120110/schmidt-storm-alert-the-google-chairman-didnt-like-your-question/">Eric Schmidt</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We absolutely allow our partners to change the interface, as long as they don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t change user compatibility.</blockquote></p>
<p>Google <em>allows</em>?</p>
<p><em>Update 2:</em> Speaking of no logos, here's <a href="http://tracks.ranea.org/post/15625320609/mg-siegler-why-i-hate-android">Watts Martin</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Go into an AT&T, Verizon, or Sprint store and set out a few Android models along with an iPhone and maybe a couple &acirc;&euro;&oelig;none of the above&acirc;&euro;¬ù smartphones they sell. One and only one of those phones is going to be entirely free of the carrier logo. Don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be under the illusion that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s merely an aesthetic issue.</blockquote></p>
