  alien character too. The 3D webcam comes in red. The 3D effects are quite good and
  brings you a bit closer to what your eyes see in reality: 3D. More pictures and
  3D videos after the jump."

<p>I received <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=novo">Novo</a>'s <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=minoru-3d">Minoru 3D</a> Webcam yesterday and was quite excited. The word "minoru" stands for reality in Japanese and you'll see why the folks at Novo decided to give this webcam that name. The Minoru <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=3d-webcam">3D webcam</a> is no normal webcam: it has two cameras. The two CMOS sensors are what makes the Minoru 3D capable of capturing <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=3d">3D</a> video. And the two cameras are what makes the Minoru 3D look like a little cute alien character too. The 3D webcam comes in red.

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-3945 aligncenter" title="minoru_3d_02_500" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/minoru_3d_02_500.jpg" alt="minoru_3d_02_500" width="500" height="333" /></p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-3947 aligncenter" title="minoru_3d_03_500" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/minoru_3d_03_500.jpg" alt="minoru_3d_03_500" width="500" height="333" /></p></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=cmos">CMOS</a> sensors have a native pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=640-x-480">640 x 480</a> and the quality is quite good. When the Minoru 3D is capturing in 3D mode, both the "eyes" are turned on (see second picture) and when it is in 2D mode just the left eye is turned on. Quite cute and intuitive.</p>
<p><object width="425" height="344" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/728b4HpRzSU&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/728b4HpRzSU&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object></p>
<p>I did a video review of the Minoru 3D webcam late last night. The lighting wasn't very good and neither was the video quality. The installation was generally smooth but did experience a little hiccup when I tried to connect the Minoru 3D via my HP <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=w2408h">w2408h</a>'s USB hub. The setup program would keep telling me (a screen capture is below):</p>
<p>No find match device, please insert camera first! After insert camera, press "yes" to continue Or press "no" to exit Setup.</p>
<p>After trying the other USB connections, I decided to connect the Minoru 3D directly to the computer. Bingo! The installation kept going and finished without any further troubles. So make sure you have a USB 2.0 connection direct from the PC. Different USB hubs might work, just not on my w2408h monitor.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-3941 aligncenter" title="minoru_3d_setup_01_500" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/minoru_3d_setup_01_500.jpg" alt="minoru_3d_setup_01_500" width="500" height="391" /></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Today, after turning on my Windows Vista Ultimate 64-bit system, I tried the Minoru 3D webcam again. The quality was "night and day"! It was a lot better than last night. So I did another follow-up review.</p></p>
<p><object width="425" height="344" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/p5AUrP3KXMU&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/p5AUrP3KXMU&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object></p>
<p>But as I was writing the specifications to the Minoru 3D webcam I realized (duh!) that the two cameras have a native pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=640-x-480">640 x 480</a> (or VGA) so I decided to make another follow-up recording at that level: the video as well as the 3D effects are MUCH better. So here's the third and final review, but in much better video and 3D quality.</p>
<p><object width="425" height="344" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/gDp1BYGVjJI&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/gDp1BYGVjJI&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object></p>
<p>Through trial and error (and a reboot) I have found the Minoru 3D webcam to be a incredibly nifty little product that lets you record video in 3D. The Minoru 3D itself is quite cute and with the three legs it can be put on the desk or on a monitor. If you want to experiment with 3D the Minoru 3D webcam can get you started for just <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NXDGFY?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=displ0f-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B001NXDGFY">$89.95 at Amazon.com</a>.</p>
