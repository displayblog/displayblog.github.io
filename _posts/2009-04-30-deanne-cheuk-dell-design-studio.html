<p style="text-align: left;">Deanne Cheuk, an artist and designer, has been commissioned by American Express, Nike, Swatch, Target, MTV and The New York Times Magazines for her illustrations and art direction. Deanne is known for <a href="http://www.neomu.com/">neomu</a>: "neomu is the graphical progression of mu magazine. The smallest magazine in the world. No words, no advertising, just inspirational images, photographs and graphics."</p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-5827 aligncenter" title="dell_design_studio_deanne_cheuk_design_collection" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/dell_design_studio_deanne_cheuk_design_collection.jpg" alt="dell_design_studio_deanne_cheuk_design_collection" width="500" height="283" /></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=dell&amp;sa=Search#1534">Dell</a> has commissioned her. In <a href="http://www.dell.com/content/topics/topic.aspx/global/shared/design_studio/en/us/design_studio?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs">Dell's new Design Studio</a> you can apply some of Deanne's amazing artwork on the back of the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/06/26/dell-studio-15-and-studio-17-notebook-pcs/">Studio 15 and Studio 17 notebooks</a>. My favorite designs are "Lovers in Noon", "Lovers in Night", and "Lovers in Morning". I have an appreciation for black and white art, designs and photographs. Very classy move from Dell.</p></p>
