<p>The BDP-S470 from Sony is a 3D-capable Blu-ray player that can handle DVD, CD, SACD and feature BRAVIA Internet Video, USB, 1080p DVD up-scaling, and TrueHD/DTS-HD Master Audio decoding. Technically, the BDP-S470 will require a firmware update later this summer to be able to playback 3D Blu-ray disks. The price is a palatable US$200 and will be available later this month. By the end of the year my guess is we'll see $99 3D Blu-ray players. That's great but we'll need to see 3D-capable TVs to also come down in price, by quite a bit.
