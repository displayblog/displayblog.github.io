<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/10/17/samsung-galaxy-player">John Gruber</a>: The maps app on Samsung's Galaxy Player 50 looks almost identical to the maps app on my iPhone. And who said Samsung is a copyist? No, the company is like a great artist. Samsung is stealing from Apple. "Steal!!!" That comes directly from the very top of Samsung's organizational structure.</p>
