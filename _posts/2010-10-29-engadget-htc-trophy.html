<p>Thomas Ricker, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/29/htc-trophy-review/">Engadget</a>, on the HTC Trophy:</p>
<blockquote><p>Try as we might, we can't put it down even though we have an iPhone 4 and Galaxy S at our immediate disposal. The HTC Trophy may not be our smartphone champ but it's definitely a winner.</blockquote></p>
<p>Let me get this straight: it's not a champ but a winner? Confusing. Most likely the newness of Windows Phone 7 is what's contributing to the heightened interest. The HTC Trophy sports a 3.8-inch TFT LCD with a WP7-standard 800x480 pixel format. My guess: eventually the iPhone 4 or the Galaxy S would be picked up more.</p>
