<p><a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/11/01/first-sales-numbers-of-3d-tvs-and-3d-pcs-in-japan/">Crunch Gear</a>: A total of 131,000 3D TVs were sold in Japan from April to September according to Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries (JEITA). That translates into 1.34% of all flat panel display (FPD) TVs sold in Japan during that time frame. I'm not very excited about 3D and it seems neither are folks in Japan.</p>
