<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20130218PD208.html">DIGITIMES</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>LG Display has announced it will invest US$657 million to construct a new 8.5G line for producing OLED TV panels.</blockquote></p>
<p>Most likely in Paju.</p>
<blockquote><p>The market observers said the OLED TV panels are likely to be provided only to LG Electronics, which will sell the TV unit at a US$10,000 price tag.</blockquote></p>
<p>Not <em>will</em> sell the OLED TVs, but <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2013/01/01/lg-55em9700/"><em>is</em> currently selling</a>. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/14/us-lg-tv-idUSBRE91D03Z20130214">LG Electronics announced pre-orders reached more than 100 units</a>. That's not that many considering hundreds of millions of TVs are expected to be sold in 2013, but that's 100 55-inch OLED TVs more than any other brand.</p>
