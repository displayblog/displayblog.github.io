<p>On September 9, 2010 Chimei Innolux (CMI) announced August 2010 TFT LCD related revenues, which were down 9.9% M/M to NT$45.5 billion. Large-sized LCD unit shipments also declined 3.8% M/M to 9.8M units as did small/medium LCDs, down by 8.4% M/M to 35.5M. The third quarter of each calendar year is usually one of the busiest as the entire LCD supply chain gear up to build toward the fourth quarter, which is the strongest quarter for LCD-related gear in retail.</p>
