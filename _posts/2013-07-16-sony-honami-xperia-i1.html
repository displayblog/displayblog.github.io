<p>Rumor has it Sony is working on its next flagship smartphone codenamed Honami, which will be marketed as the Sony Xperia i1. There are two features that I am interested in. One is the 5-inch 1920x1080 Triluminos LCD sporting quantum dots, and the second is the 20-megapixel Exmor R image sensor capable of recording 4K video and top-notch low-light photography.</p>
<p>Sony's Triluminos technology takes advantage of a blue LED and a glass tube with two types of quantum dots. The quantum dots absorb and re-emit the blue light from the blue LED as red and green light. Compared to the broad spectrum light generated by a blue LED coated with yellow phosphor, white light using quantum dots result in more intense reds, greens, and blues.</p>
<p>A large color gamut without accurate colors end up being useless; just have a look at the blown out colors on many OLED display equipped Samsung Galaxy smartphones. I hope Sony takes advantage of its brilliant TV heritage and make colors as real as possible. Sony has an opportunity to bring to market a smartphone with a remarkable display.</p>
<p>The 20-megapixel Exmor R image sensor is rumored to be the same one used in the newly introduced RX-100 II compact camera. The RX-100 II is capable of quickly focusing on subjects in near dark environments; it's low-light capabilities are best in class. Imagine a smartphone that takes photos as good as the RX-100 II. And, there's 4K.</p>
<p>Once 4K recording is possible on a smartphone it's game over; 4K has come. The only concern I have is storage space. According to rumors Honami will come in two versions: 16GB and 32GB, with SD expansion up to an additional 64GB. With new video compression algorithms such as H.265, 4K video should be only about 50% larger than 1080p. Be on the look out for 64GB SD deals; you'll need them.</p>
<p>A 5-inch 1080p Triluminos LCD combined with RX-100 II-like photo capabilities and 4K recording makes the rumored Sony 'Honami' Xperia i1 one heck of a smartphone.</p>
