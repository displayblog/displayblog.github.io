<blockquote><p>A customer asked to compare our screen with an iPad screen in sunlight and while en route outside I ran into Charbax and asked him if he wished to video tape it...</blockquote></p>
<p>The result as you can see from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgQuLPNP1QU&feature=player_embedded">this video</a> below is spectacular: Pixel Qi's 3qi display looks like it has alien technology compared to the iPad's IPS LCD, which is no slouch when it comes to more earthly standards.</p>
