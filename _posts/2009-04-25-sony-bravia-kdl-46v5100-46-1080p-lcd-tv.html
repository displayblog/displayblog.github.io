<p><strong>High Contrast &amp; Color Gamut</strong> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?s=sony">Sony</a>'s KDL-46V5100 is a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?s=46%22+1080p+lcd+tv">46" 1080p LCD TV</a> with some features that stand out. The static contrast ratio of 5000:1 is fairly high and the color gamut is 90% NTSC instead of the regular 72% NTSC probably due to a WCG-CCFL (wide color gamut CCFL) backlight. Other notables include four HDMI plugs.</p>
<p><strong>Nice Design But</strong> I like the simple design of the KDL-46V5100 but there does seem to be a some distraction in the smooth design thanks to the buttons and text in the front. Placing them in the front is more convenient but most of us probably don't use them all that much thanks to the remote control. It would have been better if those buttons were placed on the side of the otherwise good-looking unit.</p>
<p><strong>No 120Hz</strong> The KDL-46V5100 falls short in one area: there are no motion blur reduction technologies. If you're glued to ESPN, I would recommend getting a TV with at least 120Hz.</p>
<p><strong>Deal</strong> If you happen to be also in the market for a PS3 (or know someone who is), you might be interested in <a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-3032127-10668840">Best Buy's deal (ends May 2) where you get $300 off if you purchase both.</a><img src="http://www.lduhtrp.net/image-3032127-10668840" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /></p>
