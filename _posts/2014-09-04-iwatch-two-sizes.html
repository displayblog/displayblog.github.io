<p>Lorraine Luk, Daisuke Wakabayashi, and Greg Bensinger, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/article_email/apple-smartwatch-to-use-short-range-wireless-1409845551-lMyQjAxMTA0MDAwNDEwNDQyWj">The Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The smartwatch would be offered in two sizes, each featuring a curved organic light-emitting diode screen, those people familiar with the device said.</blockquote></p>
<p>These factoids are, of course, merely conjecture. Two sizes? Makes sense, since most luxury mechanical timepieces have one size for men and a smaller size for women. And as far as I know this will be the first time an OLED display is used in a commercially available Apple product.</p>
