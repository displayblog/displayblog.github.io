<p>I dread having to connect my iPhone to my MacBook and sync using iTunes. The whole process is cumbersome and takes too long, especially when all I want to do is get some photos into the computer. Using a digital camera with a SD card is so much easier; I don't even need to use iPhoto.</p>
<p>This new SuperHero iPhone dock by Iomega backs up contacts and photos unto a SD card: just what I've been waiting for! I can manage my own filing system, know exactly where my photos are, and use a lightweight program like Seashore to crop and upload to DisplayBlog. The SuperHero is a great idea, but it will cost you: US$69.99.</p>
