<p>The Sony PlayStation Vita. PSVita. What a terrible name. PSP2 would have been much better. There will be two versions: WiFi and 3G. Here are the prices:</p>
<ul>
<li>WiFi: &yen;24,980, US$249, &acirc;&sbquo;&not;249</li>
<li>3G: &yen;29,980, US$299, &acirc;&sbquo;&not;299</li><br />
</ul><br />
These are some very aggressive prices for such high-end hardware that packs a quad-core CPU. The display is a 5-inch 16:9 multitouch OLED with a pixel format of 960x544. The backpanel of the PSVita is also multitouch, which I think is a little weird. The rear camera can capture 640x480 at 60fps.</p>
<p>In the US, AT&T will be the exclusive 3G wireless network provider for the 3G PSVita. I'm not sure if this is a good choice since a lot of network issues continue to surround the GSM iPhone 4 in the San Francisco Bay Area as well as in New York City, two areas where there will potentially be a lot of demand for the PSVita. The PSVita is expected to ship worldwide toward the end of 2011.</p>
<p>In light of what Apple just announced for its GameCenter connectivity will be essential for gaming that will involve people from all around the world playing with/against you. If the 3G PSVita can be hacked to use the 3G connection as a tablet of sorts this $250 portable gaming machine from Sony might be the very best deal for a modern 3G-connected gadget.</p>
