<p>Dr. Raymond Soneira, president of DisplayMate Technologies Corporation, informed me that he upgraded the Motorola Droid to Android 2.1. It has taken a long while for Google to get around to updating the Droid to 2.1. All is not good however. Dr. Soneira noticed the Gallery app was downgraded from 24-bit color to 16-bit. In <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/04/06/motorola-droid-vs-google-nexus-one/">Motorola Droid vs. Google Nexus One</a></em> the 24-bit color display system garnered a lot of praise:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Droid provides full on-screen 24-bit color, which has 256 possible intensity levels for each of the Red, Green and Blue sub-pixels that are used to mix and produce all of the on-screen image colors... The image and picture quality on the Droid is actually better than in most computer monitors and HDTVs.</blockquote><br />
Fortunately, Android 2.1 did not mess up the Browser app as it stayed at 24-bit. Image scaling in the Gallery and Browser apps also degraded from the previous Excellent ratings in 2.0 to Poor in 2.1. Some upgrade. Source: <a href="http://www.displaymate.com/Motorola_Droid_ShootOut.htm#Upgrade">DisplayMate</a></p>
<p><strong>Update 2010.04.15</strong>: According to <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2362605,00.asp">PC Mag</a> the next update to Android will restore 24-bit color. It took quite some time to get 2.1 on the Droid. I wonder how long 2.2 will take...</p>
