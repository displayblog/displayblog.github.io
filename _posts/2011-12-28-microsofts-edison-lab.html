<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/12/28/2665794/microsoft-edison-lab-holodeck-tour">The Verge</a>: Stevie Bathiche, Director of Research at Microsoft&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Edison Lab, shares some intriguing work in the area of displays. Watching the video I was most interested in the display wall where kids can see other kids, who are far away, and interact with them as if they were just on the other side of the &acirc;&euro;&tilde;window&acirc;&euro;&trade;.</p></p>
<p><em>Update:</em> I had to remove the embedded video, which started in a zoomed-in state with no way to zoom out. Apologies. The video can be seen at the link.</p>
