<p>On July 27, Nu Horizons Electronics announced that it will be distributing AUO TFT LCD panels from 1.5" to 47" in the US. Although the distribution market for TFT LCDs pale in comparison to how many are procured from HP, Dell, Gateway, Apple and others, the business is lucrative due to higher margins for customization.</p>
<p>This will provide more competition to All American, Bi-Search International, Jaco and other TFT LCD distributors in the US.</p>
