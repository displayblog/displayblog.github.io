<p>On June 2, New Zealand Racing Board announced that Sharp signed a sponsorship agreement that brings Sharp-branded TVs, photocopiers and other electronics to the NZ Racing Board. Although the connection is a loose one, I guess people do indeed watch a lot of racing on TV, and why not on Sharp TV. Maybe Sharp is getting ready to move into automotive GPS systems, in-car LCD displays or other stuff related to autos. Just a hunch, but I might be completely wrong.</p>
