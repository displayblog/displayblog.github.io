<p><a href="http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/mowi/article.php/12069_3917256_2/iPad-vs-the-World-Tablet-Market-Gets-Weird.htm">Datamation</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[...] Buying a tablet will become a very difficult homework assignment. Brand names will blur together. Consumers will struggle to understand the arcane and subtle differences between platforms, feature sets, app stores, connectivity options and document compatibility.</p>
<p>All this complexity will favor Apple. [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/12/06/fewer-hardware-options-are-better/">Fewer Hardware Options Are Better</a>, Brad Allen argues that you get a better buying experience with fewer options to choose from. You can't have too few but in general I agree less is more.</p>
<p>If you want an Apple tablet you have one choice: the iPad. Next year you'll probably have two: iPad with Retina Display and iPad we currently have now, but at a lower price. If you don't want an Apple tablet you have a ton of choices. Good luck finding just the right one.</p>
