<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/08/compal-android-tablet-with-next-gen-tegra-demoed-at-ces-video/">Engadget</a>: Compal demonstrated an Android-based tablet prototype during CES 2010. The Android tablet was being shown off by NVIDIA touting the next-generation Tegra chip coupled with a 7-inch resistive touch LCD. WiFi, SIM card slot, microSD slot and HDMI were included but GPS and Bluetooth were missing. Engadget took it for a quick spin and came away unimpressed by the general un-usability of the resistive touchscreen. Thankfully the next-gen Tegra chip was able to pump out 1080p HD video well enough. Battery life is rated to last for days and the tablet is expected to hit the market by the end of this year according to NVIDIA.</p>
