<p><a href="http://www.akihabaranews.com/en/news-14757-New+Full+HDTV+from+Sharp.html">Akihabara News</a>: The Sharp AQUOS D Series LCD TVs come in three sizes: 32", 37" and 42". There are also three color choices: red, white and black. Sharp wants you to have a second LCD TV, specifically an AQUOS D Series, with most of the bells and whistles of the first one: 120Hz and 1080p. With a 120Hz frequency motion blur should be drastically reduced, allowing you to enjoy your sports channels in 1080p (if you've got an up-converter).</p>
<p>Maybe the AQUOS D line is more affordable than the company's other line of LCD TVs, but with prices that start higher than $2000 for a 32" is not very affordable at all, despite the 1080p and 120Hz features. The 1080p and 120Hz features alone would make these LCD TVs somewhat high-end. I would change the marketing on these so the consumer expects high performance and high price, not low price. Or, Sharp should decrease the D Series LCD TVs by quite a bit.</p>
