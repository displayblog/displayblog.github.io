<p>Rumor has it Apple has told developers to prep "full screen resolution" demos of their apps. A previous story by Silicon Alley Insider states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple is preparing to show off a new, larger mobile device with a higher resolution display in January--probably a version of the Apple tablet we've been hearing about for months--according to a plugged-in source in the mobile industry.</blockquote><br />
Apple's tablet seems like it will be running on the iPhone OS. The new apps that can run in "full screen resolution" also works with the iPhone and iPod touch according to rumors. I predict Apple's tablet will blow everything else out of the water not only for the superior experience and hardware design, that's a given, but for the fact that this device will upend the book, magazine and newspaper industries.
