<blockquote><p>We&rsquo;ve created a pause button for the internet for things like dinner time, or when it&rsquo;s time to take a break from the screens and go play outside. It&rsquo;s customizable for each kid so it can be tailored to what is going on in your household.</blockquote><br />
A pause button for the Internet. Just want I've been waiting for. You can also set bedtimes, block unwanted sites, and analyze data usage by each child. Awesome.</p>
