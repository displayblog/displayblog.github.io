<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20110802PD212.html">DigiTimes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pegatron Technology has landed orders for 10 million units of iPhone 5 to become the second ODM of the smartphone. Shipments will start in September, according to industry sources.</blockquote></p>
<p>ODM? I don't think Pegatron had anything to do with designing the iPhone. <em>If</em> these industry sources are correct, the timing of the next iPhone should go something like this: in September, Pegatron begins to ship and Apple announces the next iPhone, with availability in retail slipping to October a possibility.</p>
