<p><a href="http://www.9to5mac.com/67260/why-ipad-is-winning-according-to-nvidia-ceo/">Jen-Hsun Huang</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a point of sales problem. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s an expertise at retail problem. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a marketing problem to consumers. It is a price point problem. And it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a software richness of content problem. Apple is not only better able to explain its product to consumers through dedicated sales people, but it also captures more margin than competitors who have to share margin with retail partners.</blockquote></p>
