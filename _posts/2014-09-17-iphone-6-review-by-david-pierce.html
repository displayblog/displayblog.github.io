<p>David Pierce, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/16/6154975/iphone-6-review">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yet there&acirc;&euro;&trade;s nothing truly ambitious here, no grand vision of the future or of a new way of living in the present. Apple doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have better ideas about how to make use of more display real estate, or how to help users navigate a bigger device. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not on the precipice of offering a new kind of do-it-all computer, as it might be with the iPhone 6 Plus. The latest iPhones could have been a chance for Apple to really re-examine what smartphone hardware should be, but Apple just built a bigger iPhone. Because that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s what people wanted.</p>
<p>For a variety of reasons, from the camera to the app ecosystem to the hardware itself, the iPhone 6 is one of <em>the</em> best smartphones on the market. Maybe even the best. But it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s still an iPhone. The same thing Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s been making for seven years. A fantastically good iPhone, but an iPhone through and through.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote><p>Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple is not as hungry nor as foolish as before, or as it should be.</p>
