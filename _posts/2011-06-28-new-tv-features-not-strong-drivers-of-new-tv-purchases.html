<p>Paul Gagnon, Director of North America TV Research at <a href="http://www.displaysearch.com/cps/rde/xchg/displaysearch/hs.xsl/110608_new_tv_features_not_strong_drivers_of_new_tv_purchases.asp">DisplaySearch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some of the findings from this study show that newer features are not yet strong drivers of new TV purchases compared to fundamentals like trading up in size or getting a flat panel TV.</blockquote></p>
<p>I think TV brands are trying too hard. Just keep it simple: deliver a great TV viewing experience for a good price. And having to find a pair of 3D glasses and a keyboard just to watch TV doesn't make for a good viewing experience in my opinion.</p>
