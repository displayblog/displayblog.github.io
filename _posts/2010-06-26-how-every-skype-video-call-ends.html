<p style="text-align: left;">LOL. When you're done with FaceTime the window closes right away, right? Maybe this could be a tipping point for first date video calls when people shift from Skype video calls to iChat and/or FaceTime video calls. By the way, did you know Skype is very particular about what type of webcams it wants to be nice to? I found out the hard way when I was trying to set up my Mac mini do do Skype video calls. I gave up and went with iChat.</p></p>
