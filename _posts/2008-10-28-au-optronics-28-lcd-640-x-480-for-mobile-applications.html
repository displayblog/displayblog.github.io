<p>This one is interesting. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=au-optronics">AU Optronics</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=auo">AUO</a>) showcased a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=2.8"">2.8"</a> TFT LCD with a pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=640-x-480">640 x 480</a>. That in and of itself is pretty good stuff but nothing extra ordinary. But this little LCD can sense ultra-violet rays. So if you're getting exposed to too much harmful UV rays, the 2.8" LCD will let you know. AUO is showcased the UV-sensing 2.8" LCD at FPD International along with a few other notables:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 2.2" TFT LCD for mobile applications that has almost no bordor around the LCD.</li>
<li>A 1.9" TFT LCD for mobile applications that is just 0.56mm thick.</li>
<li>A 8.9" flexible display.</li>
<li>A 2.8" 320 x 240 TFT LCD for mobile applications that has image &amp; fingerprint scanning technology.</li><br />
</ul><br />
