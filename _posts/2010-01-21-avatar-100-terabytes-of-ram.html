<p><a href="http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/news/article/0,289142,sid5_gci1379274,00.html?track=NL-52&amp;ad=745070HOUSE&amp;asrc=EM_NLN_10705035&amp;uid=5231997">SearchStorage</a>: Avatar was absolutely fantastic. Weta Digital, the New Zealand company that created the digital effects for Avatar, stated that the film's detailed animations required computing horsepower, storage capabilities like no other project.&Acirc;&nbsp;Paul Ryan, Weta Digital's CTO:</p>
<blockquote><p>King Kong used 100 terabytes of storage. For Avatar, we have 100 terabytes of RAM.</blockquote></p>
<p>That would be 100 terabytes of RAM in Weta's server farm referred to as a "render wall". Weta's render wall contains 35,000 CPU cores.&Acirc;&nbsp;It isn't surprising that Avatar required a new level of computing power but this is insane.</p>
