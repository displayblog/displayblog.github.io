<p>Vlad Savov, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/26/6845869/samsung-galaxy-alpha-review">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The contraction to a 4.7-inch screen size is a total boon for the Galaxy Alpha&acirc;&euro;&trade;s usability, but its display isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t all good news. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m not worried about the 720p resolution, which is perfectly adequate at this size. The viewing angles are also not a problem, as you&acirc;&euro;&trade;d expect from an AMOLED display, plus the Galaxy Alpha is among the most readable phones I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve used outdoors. It outdoes both the Sony Xperia Z3 and Z3 Compact in those performance measurements, but it collapses when it comes to color accuracy. That old familiar blue-green tinge that was the bane of earlier AMOLED displays has returned, and even though the Alpha&acirc;&euro;&trade;s screen uses the same Diamond Pentile subpixel arrangement as on its more senior Galaxy Note and Galaxy S brethren, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s noticeably worse. The background of the Twitter Android app is supposed to be white instead of baby blue, right?</p>
<p>[...] Samsung offers a variety of screen color modes, but none of them neutralize the bluish shift in tone. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not an absolute tragedy, and it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s something I didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t immediately notice in my first time using the Galaxy Alpha, but this kind of improper color reproduction starts to wear on you over time. Particularly if there&acirc;&euro;&trade;s someone nearby with a true high-quality display on their phone. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s disappointing to see Samsung trip up on the display front, which is at least as important, if not more, as the physical design of the handset.</blockquote></p>
<p>Weird; perhaps a different team was responsible for this particular OLED display used in the Galaxy Alpha? <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/09/22/iphone-6-6-plus-review-by-raymond-soneira/">The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 was just awarded the best smartphone display by Raymond Soneira</a>.</p>
