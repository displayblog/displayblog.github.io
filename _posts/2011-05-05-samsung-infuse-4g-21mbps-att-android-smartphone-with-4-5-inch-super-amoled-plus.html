<p>The Samsung Infuse 4G is very thin at 8.9 inches but I'm not a fan of plasticky no matter how thin or light it is. But I do understand the choice of using plastic not only to make it light and keep the cost of manufacturing down, but to improve overall reception. Dana Wollman at <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/05/samsung-infuse-4g-hands-on/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This 4.5-inch superphone -- the biggest Sammy has made to date -- feels surprisingly light in the hands, despite its width. That's largely thanks to its crazy-thin 8.99mm profile, along with a subtly textured backside. The Super AMOLED Plus display, which promises to be brighter than Super AMOLED as well as easier to view in direct sunlight, is simply stunning. We were seriously impressed by the punchy colors and deep blacks, although that outdoor test will have to wait for another day.</blockquote></p>
<p>The 4.5-inch Super AMOLED Plus display is Samsung's biggest and is integrated into the Infuse 4G Android smartphone. The Plus in Super AMOLED Plus indicates that the OLED sub-pixel structure is RGB stripe and not PenTile Matrix. The Samsung Infuse 4G is also AT&T's first HSDPA Category 14 smartphone bumping downloads speeds up to 21Mbps.</p>
