<p><a href="http://www.toshiba-sol.co.jp/news/detail/071101-2.htm">Toshiba</a> <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.akihabaranews.com/en/news-15048-3840x2400+on+a+22%22+LCD+Possible+%3F+Yep+%21+Think+Toshiba+%21.html">Akihabara News</a>: Toshiba's 22" LCD has more than 4x the number of pixels compared to a 24" that typically has a pixel format of 1920 x 1200. Even the jumbo 30" LCD monitors have 'only' 2560 x 1600, which is four times that of 1280 x 800. Given the right UI, I can imagine how useful this monitor might be to get many full-sized windows up and running. Of course there is the problem of having fonts that are too small. Given Windows' pseudo-abilities to manage your DPI setting, getting larger fonts on Toshiba's 22" might end up looking like it got hit with the ugly stick. I wonder how OS X would look on this 22". My guess is that the fonts would be still too small. Digital pictures, however, would look fantastic!</p>
