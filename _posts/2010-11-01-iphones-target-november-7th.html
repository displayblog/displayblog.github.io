<p>According to <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/01/target-offering-iphone-4-3gs-starting-november-7th/">Engadget</a>, the iPhone 4 and 3GS will be offered at Target starting November 7th. I can understand you would want to buy an iPhone at Target if there aren't any Apple Stores nearby, but that would be about the only reason.</p>
