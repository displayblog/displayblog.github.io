<p><a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/05/29/full-d11-interview-with-apple-ceo-tim-cook-now-available">AppleInsider</a>: Why Apple isn't working on an iPhone with a large screen, according to Tim Cook:</p>
<blockquote><p>At a macro level, a large screen today comes with a lot of tradeoffs. When you look at the size, but they also look at things like do the photos show the proper color? The white balance, the reflectivity, battery life. The longevity of the display. There are a bunch of things that are very important. What our customers want is for us to weigh those and come out with a decision. At this point we think the Retina display is the best. In a hypothetical world where those tradeoffs didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t exist, you could see a bigger screen as a differentiator.</blockquote></p>
<p>Tim Cook should have simply answered, "I don't know." Because his answer suggests he has not been properly briefed on display technology. And this is the second time Tim Cook showed his lack of understanding regarding smartphone displays. The first time was during Apple's CYQ1'13 earnings call. I couldn't believe what Tim Cook was saying so <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2013/04/23/larger-iphone/">I went line by line, tradeoff by tradeoff to show his hypothetical tradeoffs do not exist</a>. These simple questions should raise doubt as to how little Tim Cook knows about smartphone display technology: Why would a larger Retina display have poorer color? Poorer white balance? Poorer reflectivity? Poorer longevity? The answer: A larger Retina display wouldn't. The hypothetical world where these tradeoffs exist is only in Tim Cook's head.</p>
