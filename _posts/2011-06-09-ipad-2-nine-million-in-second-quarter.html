<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20110608PD232.html">DigiTimes</a>: The second quarter isn't over yet but estimates are flying. TPK Holdings is expected to ship more than three million touch modules for the iPad 2 in the month of June. TPK will manufacture about 1.1 million of those in-house and outsource two million to Sintek Photronics and Cando. Wintek will also supply about one million in June.</p>
<p>Only 4.5 to 5 million iPad 2s were shipped in the first quarter. For the second quarter TPK is expected to ship more than 6.3 million touch modules.  Combined with Wintek<br />
total shipments of touch modules in the second quarter could be more than nine million. For the first half of 2011, estimated shipments of the iPad 2 are around 13.5 to 14 million units.</p>
