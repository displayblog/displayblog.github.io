The user andyi posted up some great photographs comparing <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=motorola+droid&amp;sa=Search#1348">Motorola's DROID</a> and Apple's iPhone 3GS. As most of you know having more megapixels does not necessarily mean better pictures. But in some cases the additional detail from the extra pixels might be helpful. The DROID took a decent stab at the apples and came out with a lot of detail in the image. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andyi/sets/72157622609402533/with/4075815470/">Hop on over to flickr</a> to see what wasn't so good among a whole bunch of over pictures.</p>
