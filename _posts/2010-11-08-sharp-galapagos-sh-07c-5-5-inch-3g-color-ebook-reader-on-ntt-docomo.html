<p><a href="http://en.akihabaranews.com/70649/phones/docomo-sh-07c-e-book-reader-from-sharp">Akihabara News</a>: The Sharp Galapagos SH-07C is a 5.5-inch ebook reader sporting a color TFT LCD, 1024x600 pixel format, 3G and weighs just 240 grams. Onboard is 32GB of internal memory. The overall design reminds me of the iPhone 4 with an aluminum/stainless steel middle sandwiched between two black layers of glass/plastic. I would like you to pay particular focus on the right button: doesn't that remind you of a certain button on iPhones and iPads?</p>
