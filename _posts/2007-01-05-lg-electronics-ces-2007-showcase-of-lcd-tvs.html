<p>LG Electronics (LGE) will be at booth #8214, Central Hall, at the Las Vegas Convention Center during CES 2007. LGE will be showcasing 20 LCD TVs with nine of them sporting Full HD capability with a pixel format of 1920 x 1080.</p>
<p>LC7 Series<br />
Offers widest range of sizes from 20"-47" with the 47" being Full HD (1080p) capable. The LC7 series include LG Simple Link, a contrast ratio of 5000:1 and TruWide viewing angle technology.</p>
<p>LB4B Series<br />
Sizes include 32", 37", 42", 47" and features TruMotion Drive, three HDMI inputs, USB host capability for JPEG and MP3 playback. The 47", the 47LB4D, sports a 1080p Full HD display.</p>
<p>LB5D Series<br />
Sizes include 37", 42", 47", 52" all with Full HD 1080p capability and features three HDMI inputs and USB host capability.</p>
<p>LY3D Series<br />
Sizes include 47", 52", 52" at Full HD 1080p. TruMotion Drive and wide color gamut are features. The color gamut is improved to 92% NTSC, much more than your typical 72% NTSC. This is most likely due to the use of a wide color gamut CCFL (WCG-CCFL) rather than LEDs.</p>
<p>LS7D Series<br />
Sizes include 20" and 23" widescreens with ATSC, NTSC and QAM tuners.</p>
<p>TruWide Viewing Angle<br />
All models that are 32" and larger sport Super IPS (S-IPS) panels with LGE's TruWide Viewing Angle technology that maintains uniform contrast ratio, reduces color shift and angles up to 178 degrees.</p>
<p>TruMotion Drive<br />
TruMotion Drive is the name used for panels featuring 120Hz frequencies, double that of the typical 60Hz. The doubling of frequency improves motion picture response time and reduces motion blur.</p>
<p>XD Engine<br />
Every model comes with LGE's XD Engine, which upconverts and scales low-resolution analog signals to near HD levels. The XD Engine also improves the contrast ratio by deepening the black levels.</p>
<p>LG Simple Link<br />
All models 26" and larger make use of HDMI-CEC standards to enable user control of other components connected via HDMI. At least two HDMI (w/HDCP) ports are included for 26" and larger models.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, there are too many series and it could bode well for LGE to trim the number down to about two or three. I'm getting confused even as I write this. I really do like the features the top-end models have such as 1080p, S-IPS, 120Hz and HDMI-CEC.</p>
