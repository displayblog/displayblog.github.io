<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/11/3317586/kindle-fire-hd-review-7-inch">Joshua Topolsky, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The 7-inch, 1280 x 800 display on the Fire HD is fantastic. The IPS, LCD screen looks better than probably any other tablet display I've seen, save for the new iPad. While the pixel density is the same for both the Nexus 7 and the Fire HD (216 compared to the iPad's 264), the Fire blows away the Nexus in terms of color richness, black levels, and general brightness. It definitely looks more like an Apple-quality display, and it's clear the company put a lot of effort into making an impression here. Though Amazon has touted the anti-glare coating of the screen, it can still be plenty shiny when viewing content in a decently lit room.</blockquote></p>
<p>1280x800. The 7-inch Kindle Fire HD has a 16:10 aspect ratio. I wonder why it's not 1280x720. What's the extra 80 pixels for? Why not make it a clean 16:9 aspect ratio that's perfect for viewing 720p HD video? Even Apple contorted the pixels into a weird 1136x640 to make it 16:9 on the iPhone 5.</p>
<p>I think it's time glare got the boot, but Amazon picked <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2012/09/17/kindle-fire-hd-lg-display-ld070wx3-sl01/">LG Display's 7-inch LD070WX3-SL01 LCD</a> and it looks like it was a brilliant choice.</p>
