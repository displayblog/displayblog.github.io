<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/03/01/feed-readers-blanc">John Gruber</a> on iPhone feed reading apps:</p>
<blockquote><p>... there are a bunch that are pretty good, but not one that's great.</blockquote><br />
I think Apple <em>could</em> develop a great RSS reader for the iPhone. But if OS X for the Mac is any evidence of Apple's considerations for a RSS reader, I wouldn't hold my breath. Apple integrates RSS reading capabilities into Mail and Safari, but doesn't have a standalone app. This is interesting to me. Maybe Apple thinks RSS reading is just an adjunct function for different apps.</p>

<blockquote><p>The predicament with feed reading apps is most certainly not in the quantity of the selections; rather, the quality. ... I prefer a simple app that does less and does it better.</blockquote><br />
Agreed, I too like simple, functional, elegant apps.</p>
