<p>As expected the Palm Pre 2 will pack a 5 megapixel camera and a 3.1-inch 480x320 multitouch glass-covered LCD. The size of the display is on the small side compared to a lot of newly-announced Android and WP7 phones. The pixel format of 480x320 is downright 2009, but the resolution isn't bottom-crawling, with a respectable 186.09 PPI.</p>
<p>webOS 2.0 looks to be more task-oriented and less app-oriented. I get that feeling with the Just Type feature that allows you to start typing without opening an app. I'm guessing after you're done typing you tell it to either send it as an email, update your Facebook status, or search, etc. I'm not sure if that'll work. I tend to think, "I need to email so-and-so," and then I get going on that, by opening up the email app. </p>
<p>HP always had a strong French connection at the top so it isn't surprising that the Palm Pre 2 will be launching this Friday, October 22nd, in France. In the US the Palm Pre 2 is slated for Verizon in the next couple of months. Source: <a href="http://www.boygeniusreport.com/2010/10/19/hp-announces-palm-pre-2-webos-2-0/">Boy Genius Report</a></p>
