<p><a href="http://www.tomtom.com/products/product.php?ID=1045&amp;Category=2&amp;Lid=4">Tom Tom</a>: The Tom Tom GPS Kit for the iPod touch has a built-in GPS receiver, enabling the iPod touch to become a GPS navigation device. The US$100 charging and spinning windshield mount features an audio line-out, built-in speaker and works with all iPod touch models including the very first generation. To make it work you'll need to invest another $100 on the app bringing the total to $200. Expensive but maybe worth it for those of you who would rather not deal with another gadget.</p>
