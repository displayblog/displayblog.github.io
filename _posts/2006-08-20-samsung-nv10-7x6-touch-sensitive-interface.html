<p>Samsung's NV10 is a 10.1 megapixel compact digital camera with a 2.5" wide-view LCD. It has Samsung's Advanced Shake Reduction (ASR) system that allow clearer picture-taking in low ambient light situations. The NV10 also takes MPEG4 videos at 640 x 480 resolutions and at a fast clip of 30fps.</p>

<p>Also the LCD is a large 2.5" with lots of pixels. 230,000 to be exact. The great thing about Samsung's NV series is the new user interface that is based on a 7x6 (7 vertical, 6 horizontal) button system that is touch-sensitive. I was wondering how this would work when I first saw pictures of the NV10 and now <a href="http://www.stuffmag.co.uk/hotstuffarticle.asp?de_id=2233">Stuff Magazine has a video review</a> of it and thinks it's great. I think the interface makes for very straight-forward UI designs. This is much better than the multiple buttons that are everywhere on the digital camera with some having two dials in addition to all those buttons. A great incremental development that should allow users to change settings without having to do a detailed study on the interface.</p>
