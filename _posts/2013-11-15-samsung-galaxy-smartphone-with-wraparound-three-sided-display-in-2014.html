<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-14/samsung-said-to-plan-galaxy-smartphone-with-wraparound-display.html">Jungah Lee, Bloomberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The phone will use an upgraded version of Samsung&acirc;&euro;&trade;s technology called Youm, currently featured in the curved Galaxy Round handset, the people said, asking not to be identified because the plans haven&acirc;&euro;&trade;t been released. The display may be used in the S or Note series of premium handsets or may be the first in a new line, the people said. Samsung plans to have each side of the display operate independently.</blockquote></p>
<p>I understand <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2013/11/11/apple-said-developing-curved-iphone-screens-new-sensors/">a wraparound&mdash;on all sides&mdash;cover glass</a>, but I'm not sold on a wraparound display. I can see a specific need: for folks enduring excruciatingly boring meetings who need to peek at notifications, and waiting for that one emergency notification so he can be excused. Besides that, I can't imagine what the wrapped around portions of the display would be good for. Kudos to Samsung for trying really hard though.</p>
