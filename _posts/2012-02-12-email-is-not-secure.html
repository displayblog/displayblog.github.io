<blockquote><p>Email is simply not secure. Messages are not secure in transit: the protocol used for sending email (SMTP) does not require encrypted connections, so it could easily be intercepted by a third party as travels over the internet. You also have no guarantees about the security of a recipient&acirc;&euro;&trade;s email client or server. A hacker could have surreptitious access to a recipient&acirc;&euro;&trade;s inbox, or curious IT guy could be reading through email on the server.</blockquote></p>
<p>Is there an alternative? I'm not so sure. I think one way to limit exposure to security-related risks is to <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2012/02/08/the-single-sentence-email-project/">limit how much we write in our emails</a>.</p>
