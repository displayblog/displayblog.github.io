<p><a href="http://dailyexhaust.com/2011/05/pads.html">Michael Mulvey</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The advice you usually get when launching a new product is to set it apart from the competition. This isn't the case in the tablet market because none of the iPad competitors have a value-add or anything they do better than the iPad (OK, the TouchPad looks good, if it ever launches).</blockquote></p>
<p>The examples Mulvey gives for lemming-like behavior when it comes to tablet names: Asus Padfone, HP TouchPad, LG Optimus Pad, MSI WindPad, ViewSonic ViewPad. Pad, pad, pad...</p>
