<p>I just received a lengthy email stating that my Amazon Web Services (AWS) Free Tier is expiring and I will "begin to be charged at the standard, pay-as-you-go service rates". So I cancelled. Nothing interesting there, but I was reading through my RSS feeds and came upon <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/02/10/aws-57-10">John Gruber's post on "Amazon's Updated AWS Service Terms"</a>. Gruber pointed out <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/">Section 57.10</a> so I was curious. It's weird, but here's the crazy part:</p>
<blockquote><p>However, this restriction will not apply in the event of the occurrence (certified by the United States Centers for Disease Control or successor body) of a widespread viral infection transmitted via bites or contact with bodily fluids that causes human corpses to reanimate and seek to consume living human flesh, blood, brain or nerve tissue and is likely to result in the fall of organized civilization.</blockquote></p>
