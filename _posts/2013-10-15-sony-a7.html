<p><a href="http://www.sonyalpharumors.com/sr5-hot-first-full-size-images-of-the-a7-and-a7r-cameras-with-lenses/">Sony Alpha Rumors</a>: The Sony A7 and A7r are full-frame E-mount mirrorless cameras. I'm scratching my head wondering why Sony is using the Alpha brand instead of the NEX brand. Isn't NEX Sony's brand for mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/16/5213600/sony-alpha-a7-a7r-review">Dan Seifert, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like the RX1, the a7s aren&acirc;&euro;&trade;t without their faults, namely a poor autofocus system, poor battery life, still fairly high price tag, and very limited lens options. But they are just the start, the first of a breed of camera that is sure to be the nail in the DSLR&acirc;&euro;&trade;s reflex mirror. Many photographers might hesitate to jump ship right away &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; the a7s aren&acirc;&euro;&trade;t ideal for sports photography and other specific disciplines &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; but once Sony builds out the lens options and improves the autofocus, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll be all but over.</blockquote></p>
<p>Things to wait for: faster autofocus system, longer battery life, a lower price, with more lens options. But what I'm really waiting for is an interchangeable lens smartphone.</p>

<p>Back in October of last year when Sony announced its A7 and A7r full-frame E-mount mirrorless cameras I wondered why Sony used the Alpha brand instead of the more appropriate NEX brand. Now we know: Sony is nixing the NEX brand and consolidating its mirrorless camera brand with Alpha. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/6/5278998/sony-a5000-announcement">During CES 2014 Sony introduced the A5000</a>, the latest E-mount mirrorless interchangeable lens camera, which Sony claims is the lightest with WiFi.</p>
