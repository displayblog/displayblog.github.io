<p>The Taiwan Intellectual Property Office (TIPO) dismissed a patent invalidation action filed against <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=%22seoul+semiconductor%22">Seoul Semiconductor</a> (SSC) by Advanced Optoelectronic Technology (AOT), a Taiwan-based <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led">LED</a> manufacturer and relates to Seoul Semiconductor's <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=%22white+led%22">white LED</a> patent in Taiwan. According to SSC the company has also won patent cases against Itswell and Mediana Electronics in Korea regarding its white LEDs. SSC alleges that AOT has been infringing on its patent on a white LED manufacturing method in Korea since 2002 and in August 2005 the Seoul Central District Court ruled in favor of SSC, concluding that AOT had infringed on SSC's white LED patent technology. In November 2006, the Intellectual Property Tribunal in Korea turned down AOT's claim to invalidate SSC's Korean patent registration. And now, TIPO has rejected AOT's claim to invalidate SSC's Taiwan patent registration. The patent registration process has already been completed by SSC in China, Japan, Taiwan and the US. White LEDs can be used for flashlights, general lighting, automotive lighting, mobile phone keypads and flashes.</p>
