<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=oled">OLED</a> displays are marvelous, at least the prototypes that I have seen at SID 2008. OLEDs are super thin, colors are brilliant and black levels are truly <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=kuro">kuro</a>! But there are many challenges to OLED displays becoming the next display standard. A LOT. One challenge is the short lifetimes of the OLED materials that lasts, at most, about 30,000 hours (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/05/08/sony-xel-1-17000-hour-lifetime/">Sony's claim for its XEL-1 OLED TV's lifetime</a>). Another challenge is differential aging where brightness is lost at different rates leading to discoloration of the OLED display.</p>

<p>Another challenge is that in most cases OLED has to use a TFT backplane made from a Low Temperature Poly-Silicon (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=ltps">LTPS</a>) process due to the need for higher electron mobility leading to faster performance. Well LTPS is a difficult process that has lower than wanted yields and is rather expensive. </p>

<p>LG Display showcased a concept called Dual-plate OLED (DOD) that uses the encapsulation glass as a OLED substrate and connects to an a-Si TFT backplane via a contact spacer. The contact spacer has a dual role: it is used as a spacer but also as a contact between the TFT backplane and the top OLED substrate. This allows for use of a-Si based backplane that is easier, more affordable and has high yields. The DOD prototype was rather large at 15". Cheaper and larger OLEDs, I'm all for that! But I'm not holding my breath.</p>
