<p><a href="http://www.auo.com/?sn=107&lang=en-US&c=12&n=1161">AU Optronics</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>AU Optronics Corp. today announced its preliminary consolidated April 2011 revenue of NT$33,174 million, down by 7.7% month-over-month and 19.4% year-over-year. </p>
<p>For April 2011, large-sized panel shipments, with applications on desktop monitor, notebook PC, LCD TV and other applications, were around 9.98 million units, a decrease of 6.8% from the previous month. As for small-and-medium-sized panels, the shipments were nearly 14.11 million units, down by 15.9% month-over-month.</blockquote></p>
<p>Weak LCD TV panel prices and the appreciating NT dollar didn't help AUO. The second largest LCD supplier in Taiwan, after Chimei Innolux, will shift toward high-end LCDs: smartphones, tablets, LCDs with LED backlights, and 3D.</p>
