<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/27/5351656/tim-cook-on-iphone-sales-mix-was-stronger-to-5s">Chris Welch, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>During Apple's quarterly earnings call today, Apple CEO Tim Cook admitted that the company made some miscalculations about consumer demand for the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C in North America. "It was the first time we ever ran that play, and demand percentage turned out to be different than we thought," Cook said. Apple doesn't break out individual sales figures for each iPhone model, but Cook made it clear that the iPhone 5S has thus far proven more popular than the cheaper 5C. "The mix was stronger to the 5S, and it took us some amount of time to build the mix that customers were demanding.&acirc;&euro;¬ù</blockquote></p>
<p>The tried and true strategy probably would have worked just as well as it has since the beginning: bring down the older iPhone 5 to US$99 with a contract and introduce the iPhone 5s at $199 as the new top-of-the-line. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2013/09/11/iphone-5c/">I thought the iPhone 5c would do better</a>, but I guess people consider old tech as old, no matter the cover.</p>
