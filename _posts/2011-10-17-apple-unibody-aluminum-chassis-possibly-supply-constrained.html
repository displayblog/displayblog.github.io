<p><a href="http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2011/10/17/apple-supplier-ordered-to-shut-china-plant-on-environmental-concerns/">Financial Times</a>: Apple's unibody aluminum chassis are built by Taiwan's Catcher Technology. Chinese regulators ordered part of its plants to be closed due to environmental concerns. China is getting serious about environmental complaints, a good thing, but supply constraints for Apple are likely.</p>
