<p>On February 12, Endicott Research Group (ERG), a manufacturer of DC-AC inverters based in Endicott, NY, introduced its new Smart Force family of LED driver solutions for high-bright LEDs used in LCD backlighting applications. The company can provide just the LED driver board or a complete kid that includes the driver board and LED rails. The high-bright LED drivers can be used in applications ranging in size from 6.4" to 20" and larger. ERG's driver boards use a DC-DC boost to provide voltage to a constant current driver and LED rail and can be designed with input voltages ranging from 5V to 48V.</p>
