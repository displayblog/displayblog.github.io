<p>Josh Lowensohn, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/12/6142359/tim-cook-says-apple-could-have-made-a-bigger-iphone-years-ago">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;We could have done a larger iPhone years ago,&acirc;&euro; Cook told Charlie Rose in <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/12/6142027/apple-ceo-tim-cook-talks-steve-jobs-beats-and-tv">an interview that airs later today</a> on PBS. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;It's never been about just making a larger phone ... it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s been about making a better phone in every single way. And so we ship things when they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re ready, and we think that both the display technology here, the battery technology, but all &mdash; but everything else and the software.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>At least Steve Jobs made his BS believable. The iPhone 6 is a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;better phone in every single way&acirc;&euro;? Let&acirc;&euro;&trade;s take a look.</p>
<p>HIDEOUS ANTENNA STRAPS. These antenna straps make the iPhone 6 look like toys. They are comical and clash against the rest of the design. Make the antenna straps less visible by using a color that is close to the color of the rest of the iPhone. A poor design choice.</p>
<p>BULGING CAMERA. If you lay the iPhone 6 down on its back, it doesn't lay flat, because of the bulging camera. Simple rule for Apple when it comes to future iPhones: Don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t make the body so thin the camera needs to bulge out. In terms of function, optical image stabilization (OIS) is nice, but the lens is still at f/2.2. How about improving the lens to f/2.0 or f/1.8. How about improving the light gathering capabilities of the image sensor? You've had an entire year. Phase detection autofocus is fast yes, but contrast detection is more accurate. That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s why advanced camera systems use both. Phase detection also consumes more power.</p>
<p>POWER BUTTON. Apple moved the power button from the top of the iPhone to the upper right. Great. Millions upon millions of users have gotten used to the power button on top for many iPhone generations. Now they have to readjust to having the button somewhere else. The reason for the move? It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s easier to get to because the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are so big. It won't be easier because no one is used to the power button being there. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll be harder for everyone. And even if we get used to the new location pressing the power button down is easier than pressing it in from the right to the left.</p>
<p>1920X1080. Apple finally caught up to the middle of the pack. Display technology? There are IPS LCDs with 2560x1440 (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/04/22/lg-g3/">LG G3</a>). There are OLEDs with 2560x1440 (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/09/03/samsung-galaxy-note-4/">Samsung Galaxy Note 4</a>). Dual domain LCDs have been around for years. So have multi-domain LCDs. Full sRGB is nice. But how about getting rid of reflections and glare, reducing reflectance, and making the glass oleophobic/lipophobic? <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/09/11/iphone-6-no-sapphire-cover-glass-why/">A sapphire cover glass might have been nice</a>.</p>
<p>SIX MODELS. How about instead of having more LTE bands, we have just one model. Apple has six different iPhone 6 models. <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone-6/specs/">Here's the list</a>: A1549 (GSM), A1522 (GSM), A1549 (CDMA, A1522 (CDMA), A1586, A1524. A better iPhone would have all the bands in a single device so we won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t need to worry about whether our iPhones will work on different carriers. My friend Frank recently purchased a LG G3 and he showed me how he can switch between CDMA and GSM, by changing a setting. Now that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a step in the right direction. Why can't Apple do this &mdash; something that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s clearly better &mdash; instead of making a whole bunch of different iPhone models?</p>
<p>The iPhone 6 is better in every single way? Not even close. My advice to Tim Cook: stop exaggerating so much.</p>
