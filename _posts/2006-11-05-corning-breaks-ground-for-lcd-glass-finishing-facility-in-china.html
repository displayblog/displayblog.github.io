<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=corning">Corning</a> announced November 2, 2006 that it held a ground-breaking ceremony for a new <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-glass">LCD glass</a> finishing facility in China. The LCD glass substrate finishing facility is located in the Beijing Economic Technological Development Area and is expected to begin operations in the first half of 2008. Glass finishing is just a final step that does not require much capital investment and historically Corning has established glass finishing facilities first. China now has three LCD manufacturing companies including <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sva-nec">SVA-NEC</a>, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=boe">BOE</a> OT and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=infovision">Infovision</a>. These LCD fabs currently focus on standard LCD panels such as <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=15"">15"</a>, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=17"">17"</a> and some <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=19"">19"</a> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-monitor">LCD monitor</a> panels, by far the easiest to produce. In the future, these Chinese LCD suppliers will move toward larger LCD monitor panels as well as smaller LCD TV panels. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=notebook-pc">Notebook PC</a> panels are generally much harder to make as are larger more technically advanced <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a>s.</p><br />
