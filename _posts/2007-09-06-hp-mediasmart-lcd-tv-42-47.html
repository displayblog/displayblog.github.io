This is a handsome unit, especially considering that it comes from an IT company, HP. HP has come a long way since its pocket calculators, printers, etc. Now HP wants a space in your living room. Unfortunately, there is a bit too much IT inside this TV. The first models, according to industry sources were very difficult to install and operate. I heard that they were a bit baffled when they were instructed to reboot the TV. Yes, we have come to rebooting TVs, well, those with HP MediaSmart TVs that is. I hope I never have to reboot my TV.<br />
They come in two sizes 42" and 47" and both are 1080p, but no 120Hz, and no LED backlights. HP touts that its TVs "connect you to the digital media content on all the PCs on your home network and the Internet". If this is true, and I am sure it is, I can only imaging the hassle of connecting and setting up every single PC you have at home, even if you have just two. There is also a HP MediaSmart TV&acirc;&euro;&trade;s online service that lets you access movies and videos. I haven't seen or tested this new box, but I have a feeling that it won't be as easy to use as it looks. I like the DivX and XVID support though!</p>
