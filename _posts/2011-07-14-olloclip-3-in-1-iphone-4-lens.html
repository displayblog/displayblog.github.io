<blockquote><p>Apart from the barrel distortion we mentioned earlier, we were exceptionally pleased with the photos we took with the Olloclip. Sure, the compact, dual-sided, three-in-one lens won't match the image quality of a pro rig, but considering its size and versatility, it may just become the next must-have accessory for Apple's iPhone 4.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://olloclip.com/">Olloclip</a> is a clip-on 3-in-1 one lens for the iPhone 4 that has fisheye, wide-angle, and macro lenses. Priced at US$69.95.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.02.24:</em> <a href="http://www.thetechblock.com/articles/2012/olloclip-vs-ipro-lens-review/">Abdel Ibrahim</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Olloclip, you see, goes for $69, while the iPro Len System will set you back almost three times that, at $199. With that significant price difference in mind, it all comes down to priorities. If you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re looking to get the most out of your iPhone&acirc;&euro;&trade;s camera and don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t mind a bulkier package or steeper price, the iPro&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the way to go. But for casual users who&acirc;&euro;&trade;d like to spice up their phone&acirc;&euro;&trade;s camera without breaking the bank or toting around extra hardware, the Olloclip&acirc;&euro;&trade;s just fine. In fact, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the newest addition to my arsenal.</blockquote></p>
<p>The best thing about the Olloclip is the built-in macro lens, something I've been looking for for some time. <a href="/2011/11/04/make-the-impossible-possible/">I like taking a closer look at things</a>.</p>
