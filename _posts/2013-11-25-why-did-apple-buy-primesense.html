<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/25/why-did-apple-buy-primesense-for-a-key-technology-itll-deploy-within-a-year">Charles Arthur, The Guardian</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The question is, what would Apple want with this?</p>
<p>The key is not to overthink it. Authentec does fingerprints; Apple used it for fingerprints. PA Semi makes chips; Apple's using it to make chips. C3 does mapping; Apple's using it for mapping. And so on. If PrimeSense offers embedded sensors which generate indoor real-time maps of the space around them, that's where Apple has seen a space for development.</blockquote></p>
<p>That's just the hardware. Apple is in the business of designing hardware, software, and services to make what was frustrating and cumbersome less so. Look for future portable devices from Apple to have context awareness, and therefore context aware services through apps.</p>
