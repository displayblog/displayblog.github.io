<p>Katherine Bourzac, <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/quantum-dots-go-on-display-1.12216">Nature</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The contrast with today&acirc;&euro;&trade;s flat screens begins with the light source. Conventional LCDs use a high-intensity blue LED backlight whose glow is converted by a phosphor coating to create a broadband, white light used to make the moving TV images. The new Triluminos tele&Acirc;&shy;visions instead pair an uncoated blue LED with a thin glass tube filled with quantum dots. Two kinds of quantum dots in the tube absorb some of the blue light from the backlight and re-emit it as pure red and green light. The resulting white light is more intense at the wavelengths of these three specific colours than the white light made by a phosphor-coated LED, so that more colour comes through in the images.</blockquote></p>
