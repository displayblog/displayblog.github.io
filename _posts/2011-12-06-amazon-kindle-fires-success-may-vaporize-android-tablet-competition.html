<p><a href="http://allthingsd.com/20111206/kindle-fire-will-vaporize-android-tablet-rivals/">John Paczkowski</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This according to Evercore Partners analyst Robert Cihra, who says the Kindle Fire&acirc;&euro;&trade;s loss-leading $199 price could effectively ruin the market for other Android tablet makers.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Amazon&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Kindle Fire has come out of the gates strong,&acirc;&euro; Cihra writes. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;[And its] success may just vaporize other &acirc;&euro;&tilde;for profit&acirc;&euro;&trade; Android tablet OEM roadmaps.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>The expectation is the Amazon Kindle Fire will capture 50% of the Android tablet market in 2012.</p>
<p>The overall tablet market will be interesting: In between the US$199 Kindle Fire and the $499 iPad 2 is where everyone will need to compete. Both are interestingly enough closed ecosystems so the competition will need to bring along a full-blown online store filled with books, magazines, newspapers, music, TV shows, movies, apps, and more. Good luck.</p>
