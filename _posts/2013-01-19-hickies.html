<p>My favorite shoes, with <a href="http://hickies.com/">Hickies</a>.</p>
<p>It's not that big of a deal, but when your shoelaces come undone it's just one more thing to take care of. And it's a bit embarrassing when someone points it out. It's bad when its raining, it's the worst when you notice right after coming out of a public bathroom. Yuck.</p>
<p>I've been wearing my Adidas shoes with Hickies for about a month and a half now. I like to test things out for a long time because at first everything could be good or bad and later turn out to be exactly the opposite. I like these Hickies on my Adidas*.</p>
<p>As you can see from the before and after Hickies photos this "elastic lacing system" made my shoes go from meh with the shoelaces going all over the place to tidy and simple.</p>
<p>There's actually only three on my Adidas. I took the first and last ones off. The first one was too long so it wasn't doing anything. The last one was too tight. So I took those off. It looks even simpler.</p>
<p>Comfort wise there is one small, but important difference. With the Hickies on, because of the elasticity, the Adidas has some give and that feels pretty good. I took a trip to Denver and did a lot of walking and I couldn't feel any discomfort. Taking off and putting on my shoes is just as easy as before.</p>
<p>If you don't want to deal with shoelaces and want a tidy, modern look to your shoes check out Hickies. There are 14 in a pack of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009PGFPIC/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=displ0f-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B009PGFPIC">Hickies, priced at US$19.99</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=displ0f-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B009PGFPIC" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> (Amazon affiliate link).</p>
<p>* These Hickies didn't work with my particular Converse shoes because the shoelace holes were too close together. Those holes need to be a bit apart for Hickies to work well.</p>
