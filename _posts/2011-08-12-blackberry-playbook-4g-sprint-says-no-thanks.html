<p>Greg Bensinger, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2011/08/12/research-in-motion-sprint-says-no-thanks-to-playbook/">The Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Research In Motion&acirc;&euro;&trade;s tablet hopes were dealt another blow as Sprint Nextel said it canceled plans to sell a version of the BlackBerry PlayBook tablet on its speedier network.</blockquote></p>
<p>Back in January Sprint said yes to a PlayBook that runs on its 4G network. The reasons for weaseling out? Business customers are ho-hum, and the tablet market is too crowded confusing average customers. Paget Alves, Sprint business markets group president:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s an interesting concept, it just hasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t caught on with business customers as much as they would like. There are so many tablets in the market, it creates confusion for the average customer.</blockquote></p>
<p>Overall response, whether from business or not, has been lukewarm. That's true. But references to a crowded tablet market or confused customers are nonsense.</p>
<p>There are four platform choices: Apple's iPad, an Android tablet, HP's TouchPad, or RIM's BlackBerry PlayBook. And when you look at who is buying what, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/07/21/ipad-tablet-share-94-61/">61% bought iPads in the second quarter</a>. They don't look confused to me. What's the real reason? Sprint thinks the PlayBook sucks.</p>
