<p>Don Wambolt, Creative Ministries Director at Worship Center in Lancaster, PA:</p>
<blockquote><p>I had seen BrightSign at an InfoComm tradeshow. They caught my eye because the media players are solid-state and very inexpensive compared to PC-based players.  Plus, BrightAuthor, the content manager software, was included free and was a visual-based application.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Worship Center has 18 displays that are connected to seven network-enabled BrightSign HD1010 media players. BrightAuthor's WYSIWYG design interface allows for straightforward creation, publishing, management and monitoring of all 18 digital signage displays.</p>
<p>Wambolt:</p>
<blockquote><p>The features of the BrightSign Network and its interface make it easy for me to group the displays by location and by the content they each need. With just a few clicks, I can update all of the information displayed in the student ministries area as well as the speaking schedule in the meeting rooms without leaving my desk.  If I need a group of signs to change at 2:00 P.M., but I know I will be in a meeting during that time, I can schedule the change in advance.</blockquote></p>
<p>The BrightSign controllers consume 3 to 5 watts of power, which is considerably less than a typical PC system that requires about 20x. And because they are solid state not only are they reliable but generate less heat requiring less cooling costs.</p>

<p>This is the Worship Center's main display in the sanctuary. Beautiful.</p>
