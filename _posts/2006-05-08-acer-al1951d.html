<p>Acer claims a 2ms response time for the AL1951D 19" LCD monitor. 2ms is a very short time for liquid crystals (LCs) to respond. I am fairly certain that LCs cannot respond this quickly and the 2ms that Acer is quoting is a perceived response time that has something to do with non-LC improvements in perceived response times. With ODC (over-drive circuitry) the LCs can be boosted to get to a certain level of grey faster than they would, but this adds cost. Of course with OCB (optically compensated bend), you can really improve LC response times, but that technology is not only difficult to manufacture (low yields) the costs are much greater. Low-viscosity LCs are also slightly more expensive. So, the Acer AL1951D 19" LCD monitor with 1280*1024 pixel format (5:4) at $379 is probably a great buy if it does in fact incorporate low-viscosity LCs, ODC, and OCB. But I doubt it. And if you're a serious gamer, you'd be glued in front of a very large CRT monitor. To date, nothing beats the response time of a CRT with 1600*1200 pixel format.</p>
