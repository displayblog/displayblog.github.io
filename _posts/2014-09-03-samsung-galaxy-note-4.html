<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/09/03/samsung-galaxy-note-4-hands-on/">Engadget</a>: The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 sports a 5.7-inch OLED display with 2560x1440 protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3, a 16MP rear-facing camera with optical image stabilization, a 3.7MP f/1.9 front-facing camera, and an aluminum frame. The aluminum frame should take Samsung off the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Crappy Plastic Smartphone Manufacturer&acirc;&euro;¬ù list.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Note 4 is an incremental enhancement to a formula (huge display plus stylus) that has worked very well for Samsung. Nothing exciting though. Available next month.</p>
