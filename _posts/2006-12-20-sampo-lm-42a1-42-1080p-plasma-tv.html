<p>Sampo introduced its LM-42A1 plasma TV that is capable of displaying 1080p video content. The LM-42A1 has wireless connectivity via 802.11a/b/g and a virtual keyboard. The built-in DVB-T tuner can receive digital and analog TV signals. With a PC connection, the high-resolution plasma TV can be used as a computer monitor. Most 1080p-cable plasma TVs at the 42" size has a pixel format of 1024 x 1080. Just make sure if you're in the market for a 1920 x 1080 display that you check the pixel format of 1080p-capable 42" units. I am unsure of the LM-42A1's pixel format.</p>
<p>Sampo also recently launched its LM-42HW35 42" XGA plasma TV with a resolution of 1024 x 768. The LM-42HW35 is only available in the Taiwanese market and is priced aggressively at NT$49,900 or about US$1,530. Sampo is making sure to have good quality as the plasma display panel (PDP) is reportedly sourced from Japan. The PDP has a brightness of 1,000 cd/m2, a contrast ratio of 3,000:1 and can display 3.6 billion colors, which tells me it is a 10-bit color display.</p>
