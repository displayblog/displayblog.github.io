<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/11/16/verizon-early-termination-fee-now-350/">Verizon recently increased its ETF (Early Termination Fee) from US$175 to $350</a>. The FCC has some questions. A few of the more interesting ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can customers learn about the formula for prorating the ETF?</li>
<li>It appears that if a customer cancels a two-year contract after 23 months, the customer would still owe an ETF of $120. Is this correct?</li>
<li>What criteria does Verizon Wireless use to decide which devices and service plans are subject to the increased EFT? (Translated: What constitutes an "advanced device"?)</li>
<li>In light of a recent New York Times article (that would be David Pogue's "<a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/12/verizon-how-much-do-you-charge-now/">Verizon: How Much Do You Charge Now?</a>") suggesting that customers may be charged $1.99 for inadvertently accessing Verizon Wireless&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Mobile Web, we would like to better understand the terms and conditions of such access.</li><br />
</ul><br />
