<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5128" style="margin-right: 5px;" title="cmo_logo" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/cmo_logo.jpg" alt="cmo_logo" width="145" height="42" /><a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3Autpr0mvi0e9&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=chi+mei+optoelectronics&amp;sa=Search">Chi Mei Optoelectronics</a> (CMO) announced its March 2009 revenues. Combined TFT LCD related revenues increased 48.7% M/M to NT$ 19.7 billion in March. CMO shipped approximately 5.7 million large-sized panels, up 34.6% M/M from February. The company also reported a 43% M/M increase in small/medium LCD panel shipments to 10.4" million in March.</p>
<p>In Q1'09, CMO's combined TFT-LCD related revenues increased 1.3% Q/Q to NT$ 44.3 billion. Approximately 13.3 million large-sized panels were shipped in Q1'09 representing a 16% Q/Q increase. Small/medium LCD panel shipments also rose 10.6% Q/Q to 23.2 million in Q4'08.</p>
<p>Overall some very good news from a top Taiwan-based LCD manufacturer. Hopefully this is a signal that the LCD industry is rebounding.</p>
