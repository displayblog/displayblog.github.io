  listen to FM radio and record it too. One of the coolest feature of the S9 is the

  I wonder if you can play Hulu video content on this? Pictures of GUI after the jump. "

<p>The folks at Cowon spent some time sprucing up the GUI and I think they did a pretty good job. Not as slick as the iPhone's but cool nonetheless.&Acirc;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NXDC4O?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=displ0f-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B001NXDC4O">Amazon has the 16GB version for $223.95</a> and is ranked #449 in the 'Electronics' department as of this writing. One of the comments made caught my attention: "The 64 million-color AMOLED screen is so amazing it will make you wonder how you survived without it." There are 12 customer reviews with 11 of them giving 4 stars or more.</p>
