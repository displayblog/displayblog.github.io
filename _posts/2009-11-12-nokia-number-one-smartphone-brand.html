<p><a href="http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1224645">Gartner</a>: Nokia is the number one smartphone brand in the third quarter of 2009 with a 39.3% share of a 41 million unit market. Nokia's 16.16 million units dwarf the others but its market share is shrinking. At #2 is Research In Motion (RIM) with 8.52 million units and capturing 20.8%. Apple is #3 with a 17.1% market share and 7.04 million units. HTC and Samsung rounded out the #4 and #5 spots respectively.</p>
<p>Nokia's smartphone market share reached an all-time low in the third quarter. On the other hand, RIM reached its highest. Popular models for RIM include the Curve 8900 in Europe and the Tour in the US. Apple added 4.2% to its market share while moving 2.3 million additional iPhones compared to the second quarter. Fourth quarter should be a boon to Apple as customers in China will be given the opportunity to purchase an iPhone.</p>
