<p>Matt Brian, <a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2012/10/21/revealed-everything-that-google-will-announce-at-its-android-event-on-october-29/">The Next Web</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Google has also been working with Samsung to launch a 10-inch tablet, confirming leaks which suggested Google had teamed up with the Korean manufacturer for another device. Our source tells us that internally the tablet goes under the name &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Codename Manta&acirc;&euro;¬ù, runs Google&acirc;&euro;&trade;s new Android 4.2 operating system (previously referred to as Key Lime Pie, but is set to retain the Jelly Bean branding), and will offer a 2560&Atilde;&mdash;1600 pixel (16:10) resolution, which we believe will offer around 300 pixels per inch (PPI) compared to the new iPad&acirc;&euro;&trade;s 264 PPI.</blockquote></p>
<p>The rumored LG-built Nexus 4 smartphone based on the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2012/08/25/lg-optimus-g/">Optimus G</a>, the ASUS-built Nexus 7 tablet, and now a rumor for a Samsung-built Nexus 10 tablet. Nexus 4, Nexus 7, Nexus 10. Makes sense.</p>
<p>The display on the 10.1 inch (I'm guessing it'll be a 10.1-inch PLS LCD) sports a 2560x1600 pixel format good for a resolution of 300 ppi. I <em>like</em>. Here's what I hope to see: in-cell touch, cover glass laminated to the LCD, thinner and lighter than the iPad (3), WiFi and LTE versions, and starting at US$499.</p>
<p>While Apple is poised to attack the smaller tablets (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2012/06/25/nexus-7/">7-inch Nexus 7</a>, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2012/09/25/amazon-kindle-fire-hd-7-inch/">7-inch Kindle Fire HD</a>, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2012/09/26/barnes-noble-nook-hd-nook-hd/">7-inch Barnes & Noble Nook HD</a>, and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2012/02/13/samsung-galaxy-tab-2-7-0/">Samsung Galaxy Tab 2</a> and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/09/01/samsung-galaxy-tab-7-7/">7.7</a>), Google is counterattacking Apple at the larger 10-inch tablet segment. October is going to be an exciting month.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.10.29:</em> <a href="http://www.oled-info.com/auo-develops-new-465-317-ppi-amoled-panel">Ron Mertens suggests the Nexus 10 will sport a 10-inch 2560x1600 IGZO LCD developed by AUO</a>. A 10.1-inch 2560x1600 LCD has a resolution of 299 ppi, which is higher than the 264-ppi iPad (3).</p>
