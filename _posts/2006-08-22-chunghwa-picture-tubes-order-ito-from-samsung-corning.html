<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=indium-tin-oxide">Indium Tin Oxide</a> (ITO) is used to put a transparent conductive coating for LCDs. And there are only a few companies that make ITO. In the oligopoly-like market for ITO, the limited number of suppliers set the price and usually very high. Chunghwa Picture Tubes (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=cpt">CPT</a>) ordered ITO from Samsung Corning. Samsung Corning has sent samples of ITO to AU Optronics (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=auo">AUO</a>) and Chi Mei Optoelectronics (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=cmo">CMO</a>). Most of the ITO suppliers are based in Japan with Nippon Mining &amp; Metals and Mitsui Mining &amp; Smelting owning about 43% each. Tosoh, a smaller player, has about 10% share. Samsung Corning is the smallest player with only a 5% share of ITO.</p>
<p>Samsung Corning was established in 1973 as a 50:50 joint venture with <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=corning">Corning</a>, USA. Samsung Corning manufactures glass for LCDs, Braun tubes, ITO coating glass for LCDs, and rotary transformers that are used for VCR head drums. I'm pretty sure the rotary transformer business is experiencing a significant downturn. Just a guess.</p>
