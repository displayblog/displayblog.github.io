<p><img class="size-full wp-image-8644 aligncenter" title="2011_Audi_A8_Google_Earth" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/2011_Audi_A8_Google_Earth.jpg" alt="2011_Audi_A8_Google_Earth" width="630" height="445" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2009/12/16/2011-audi-a8-the-first-production-vehicle-equipped-with-google/">Autoblog</a>: The 2011 Audi A8 is the first automobile to feature Google Earth. Insert a SIM card into the Multi Media Interface (MMI) or use a Bluetooth-enabled smartphone that has data connectivity and the 8-inch LCD will display 3D views of the driver's surroundings in addition to satellite imagery, terrain and the ordinary maps. According to Audi, Google Earth will be integrated mid-year in 2010 after the A8 goes on sale. I hope Audi didn't get an exclusive because I would like to see Google Earth on all the cars.</p>
