<blockquote><p>As of this morning, that is changing. We can now offer subscriptions on the iPad, and we can give our U.S. and Canadian print subscribers access to iPad issues at no additional cost. Before long, we hope to be able to give the same access to international subscribers beyond Canada and to existing digital-only subscribers.</blockquote></p>
<p>Pricing for The New Yorker: $5.99 a month ($1.50 an issue), $59.99 per year, or free with a print subscription that costs $69.95 per year.</p>
