<blockquote><p>Major League Baseball (MLB) today announced its latest technology collaboration with Apple to integrate powerful new on-field capabilities through the approved use of iPad Pro and a newly developed advance scouting, analytics and video app - MLB Dugout - during MLB games. The announcement, made by Baseball Commissioner Robert D. Manfred, Jr., brings iPad Pro into all 30 Major League dugouts and bullpens and marks the first-ever on-field integration of next generation technology, putting advance scouting video and customizable reports at the fingertips of all managers, coaches and players.</p>
<p>Entering the 2016 MLB season, each iPad Pro has been customized for each Club and loaded with the MLB Dugout app, allowing every team's manager, coaches and players to utilize their own proprietary and strategic statistical reports, data visualizations and advance scouting videos during every MLB game from dugouts and bullpens giving them easy access to valuable, actionable baseball insights. Clubs also will have the ability to include any of their own reports with data generated from last year's first full season of <a href="http://m.mlb.com/video/topic/73955164">Statcast</a>&trade; tracking technology, bringing new stats for pitch tracking, hitting, baserunning and fielding, right on iPad Pro.</blockquote></p>
<p>Managers, coaches, and players need easy and quick access to information that will give them an edge over the competition. It depends on the app's UX/UI, but in general the iPad Pro has an advantage over Windows-based tablets when it comes to easy and quick.</p>
