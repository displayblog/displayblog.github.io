<p>HTC's G2 is coming to T-Mobile in October with pre-orders slated to begin in the second half of September. The G2 will be the first Android smartphone to sport HSPA+ technology. What's so great about HSPA+? That + enables HSPA data rates up to 56Mbps downloads and 22Mbps uploads. Qualcomm's Snapdragon MSM 7230 800MHz CPU will power the Android 2.2 running G2 sporting a 3.7-inch display.</p>
