Samsung has just acquired the hardware trademark for Android. Using just four characters of the name will be in violation of trademark laws in South Korea. My gut reaction pooh-poohs Samsung. The company seems be doing evil. What a terrible move to limit competition in South Korea.</p>
<p>All phone manufacturers in South Korea, sans Samsung, will be forced to look elsewhere. I foresee a fury of development for Windows Phone 7 Series smartphones especially by LG. In the near future my bet is on South Korea's smartphone market being dominated by excellent WP7S phones, which will be superior to phones manufactured by an unfocused Samsung (Bada, Android, WP7S, etc.).</p>
