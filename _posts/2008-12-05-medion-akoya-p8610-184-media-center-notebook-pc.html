  Akoya P8160 is a very large <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=18.4\"-notebook-pc\">18.4\"
  notebook PC</a>. The LCD has an aspect ratio of 16:9 and sports a pixel format
  of <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1680-x-945\">1680 x 945</a>.
  Strange. Graphics is powered by NVIDIA's GeForce 9600M GS with 512MB. The P8160
  also has a 1.3MP webcam. The 1680 x 945 pixel format is indeed strange. To get to
  a 16:9 aspect ratio the LCD manufacturers must have cut down the vertical pixels.
  I don't like less pixels. But you do get some benefits. There are two. One is that
  when you're watching scaled-up <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=720p\">720p</a>
  HD content, you won't see any bars. But, any HD content that is scaled up or down
  will mean you lose quality. 1680 x anything is terrible for watching HD content
  since every type needs to be either scaled up or down. Not good. Second, you get
  bigger fonts right off the bat. Some like small fonts and some like big fonts. The
  P8160 is for those who like big fonts. What Medion should have done after the jump."

<p>Media center notebook PC. I should have put a question mark at the end. Why? Well, I don't consider a huge 18.4" notebook PC that can only display 720p HD content as "media center" caliber. There are smaller <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=17"-notebook-pc">17" notebook PC</a>s that can gobble up <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1080p">1080p</a> HD content and then ask for more. The GPU is certainly powerful enough for media tasks but the LCD has to go. Replace it with a 18.4" LCD sporting a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a> pixel format and Medion would be right on the money with a media center notebook PC.</p>
