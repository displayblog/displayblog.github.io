<p>I'm starting a new market research report/service titled AMZN.TV24. Here's why.</p>
<p>When I'm looking for a new TV I go to Amazon. I click on 50-inch and larger TVs with a 4-star rating or higher. The front page gives me 24 models. I thought about "Amazon's 24 4-star TV models 50-inch and larger on the front page" as the title of this report, but decided against it;&nbsp;although it was descriptive it was way too long, so I shrank it, shrank it some more, and got to&nbsp;AMZN.TV24. Sounded pretty good to me.</p>
<p>Why am I starting this new report service? I wanted to see what was going on on the TV search result front page. I wanted answers to questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the most popular brands? And how popular are they?</li>
<li>What are the most popular sizes?</li>
<li>What's more popular 4K or 1080p?</li>
<li>How much is the premium for 4K over 1080p?</li>
<li>What are the pricing trends for 4K?</li><br />
</ul><br />
Now I'm just looking at 24 models that show up each day on Amazon and I'm not pretending to think this is what's happening in the broader US TV market or the rest of the world. That would be crazy. But Amazon is a popular destination for TV buyers and most of us&nbsp;seldom go beyond the front page. Take this report service for what it is and I hope it's&nbsp;helpful to you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>BRAND SHARE</strong></p><br />
Most likely AMZN.TV24 will be a work-in-progress for a long time coming, but here's a little taste of what I have in store:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26826" src="http://displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/AMZNTV24_20160825_BrandShare.jpg" alt="AMZN.TV24 2016.08.25 Brand Share" width="590" height="398" /></p>
<p>This is a running 12-day (Sundays are empty because I rest and recuperate on Sundays) chart of brands represented on the front page. Remember I'm searching for 50-inch and larger TVs with 4-star or better customer ratings.</p>
<p>Here are some findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Samsung is dominant. Samsung has had, except for two days, 50% or more.</li>
<li>LG and TCL has been going after each other for some time and battling for 2nd place.</li>
<li>But recently Sharp has entered the picture and has taken 17% share.</li>
<li>Sony is slowly climbing back into the ring.</li>
<li>VIZIO is consistently there, but barely.</li><br />
</ul><br />
Samsung being dominant is no surprise, but Sharp has elbowed its way into second place. As you know, back in March of this year, <a href="http://displayblog.com/2016/03/30/foxconn-takes-control-of-sharp-for-us3-5-billion/">Foxconn bought Sharp for US$3.5 billion</a>. So maybe Foxconn is putting some resources behind Sharp and getting Sharp back into the US TV market. I don't know.</p>
<p>VIZIO has had at least one if not two models that show up consistently. With <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/7/26/12286756/leeco-buys-vizio-tv-company-2-billion-acquisition">LeEco buying VIZIO for $2 billion</a> last month, who knows what will happen, but VIZIO's brand is synonymous with a great deal. Generally speaking that is. I've heard from friends who&nbsp;own&nbsp;VIZIO TVs that point to display manufacturing quality going south a bit. The LCD panels inside most VIZIO TVs are VA type so the supplier(s) could be Sharp, Samsung, AUO or some other LCD manufacturer. The great thing about VIZIO's M series and more premium models&nbsp;is that the LCD panels sport direct LED backlights allowing for real local dimming, meaning better contrast.</p>
<p>LG's share has been 13% except for two days. LG uses IPS technology that is known to be better at color and brightness consistency when viewed from an angle. Thought peak brightness is generally a little lower than VA panels. Apple uses panels supplied mostly by LG Display for its iMacs, MacBooks, iPhones, and Apple Watches for good reason.</p>
<p>So there you have it. A glimpse to what I'll be working on for the time being. Hope that was helpful or at least&nbsp;interesting.</p>
