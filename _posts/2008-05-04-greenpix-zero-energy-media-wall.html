<p><a href="http://www.greenpix.org/">GreenPix</a> is a lighting project that applies sustainable and digital media technology to the Zero Energy Media Wall of the Xicui entertainment complex in Beijing, close to the 2008 Olympic Games site. The Zero Energy Media Wall was designed by <a href="http://www.sgp-architects.com/">Simone Giostra & Partners</a> and Arup.</p>
<p>Simone Giostra & Partners is an architecture firm that is responsible for the Foragers Green Supermarket in New York, the Castiglion Dell Bosco hotel and resort in Italy, and the Jingya Entertainment Center in Beijing among others. A few pictures of their work follows.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.arup.com/">Arup</a> is a global design and business consulting firm. Previous works include the New Museum of Contemporary Art in Manhattan where Arup teamed up with architects SANAA and Gensler. The New Museum of Contemporary Art is a seven-story structure that rises in a series of stacked boxes shifted off the main vertical axis. The near 60,000 square foot museum is covered in anodized aluminum mesh. </p>

<p>One of the most spectacular works by Arup is the 2008 Beijing Olympics' National Stadium. The National Stadium opened to the media on April 17, 2008 and was designed by Herzog & De Meuron architects and the China Architecture Design & Research Group. The stadium has a 91,000 seat capacity and will host the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Olympic Games. Affectionately called "The Bird's Nest" the focus was to bring the 91,000 spectators as close to the action as possible.</p>

<p>These two companies, Simone Giostra & Partners and Arup created the Zero Energy Media Wall that features the largest color LED display in the world with an integrated photovoltaic system right into a glass curtain wall. The Zero Energy Media Wall is on the Xicui entertainment complex in Beijing, China. As the name suggests, during the day, energy is harvested through the photovoltaic system and during the night the screen is illuminated and mirrors the day's climatic cycle.</p>

<p>The Media Wall will provide the city of Beijing with its first venue dedicated to digital media art, while offering the most radical example of sustainable technology applied to an entire building&acirc;&euro;&trade;s envelope to date. The building will open to the public in May 2008, with a specially commissioned program of video installations and live performances by artists from China, Europe and the US.</p>
