<p><font face="Verdana">Although there have been some negative reviews of the LG Chocolate (<a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/LG_VX8500_Chocolate/4505-6454_7-31813540.html">c|net</a>) there are some good ones too (<a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/lg_kg800_chocolate-review-88.php">GSM Arena</a>). With anything new, you will get polarized views stating that it is fantastic or terrible. I was given the opportunity to fiddle around with the touch-sensitive buttons, and... I kind of liked it. When you lightly touch the buttons, the device lights up in red. And then after a bit of non-activity, fades back to black, as if something alive is now hybernating or sleeping. When I found out the sleep feature of Apple's iBooks caused the LED in the front to look like it was actually sleeping--a slow pulsing of the LED that made you think it was breathing or something. Now that was way cool.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Although Verizon launched the Chocolate phone in the US (meaning it supports CDMA), when I went to LG's site, it states the network as being GSM Tri-band (900,1800, 1900) and GPRS Class 10. Hmmm. I then went to <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/store/controller?item=phoneFirst&amp;action=viewPhoneDetail&amp;selectedPhoneId=2426">Verizon Wireless</a> and checked out the Chocolate that it was selling for $149.99 with a 2 year service plan. And guess what? This Chocolate must have a different flavor, because it looks different!</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">The main directional pad on the CDMA Chocolate is round whereas the GSM model is more rectangular. I think the rectangular version goes better with the rectangular body design. I'm sure many others have noticed this before, but it's news to me!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">The GSM Chocolate's main display is a 2.0" TFT LCD with 176 x 220 resolution and has 265,000 colors. The Chocolate has 128MB of internal memory, a 1.3 megapixel CMOS camera without AF support resulting in 1280 x 960 resolution images (of course it can go lower to 640 x 480, 320 x 240, 128 x 160, 48 x 48 with a multishot feature of 320 x 240 at 9 frames), and uses a white LED as a flash. Bluetooth is version 1.2 with BPP, FTP, OPP and headset support. Video supports MPEG4 H.263 at 15fps and a resolution of 176 x 144 or 128 x 96. Kind of low IMO. Music playback supports MP3, WMA, AAC/ACC+ and AAC++. WAP 1.2.1 and Java MIDP 2.0 and Java applets are supported as well.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">LG's Chocolate mini-Flash site is very fluid or should I say milky as in milk chocolate milky. I enjoyed it along with the music. I thought the music was pretty fluid with a nice beat.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/09/07/lgs-black-sapphire-mg810-chocolate-flip-phone-is-real/">Engadget</a> is reporting that LG is selling a Chocolate flip-phone (versus the regular slider in the 01 model) in South America for around $465. It is called Black Sapphire with a model number MG810. The main display is a 176 x 220 TFT LCD with an external sub-display that has 96 x 96 resolution. Very similar to the Motorola RAZR.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Not much info at <a href="http://www.slashphone.com/89/3894.html">Slashphone</a>, but they are stating that the MG810 will be available in the US and sports GSM Tri-band (850, 1800, 1900MHz), a 1.3 megapixel camera, Bluetooth and a music player. The touch-sensitive keypad on the front is unique in the MG810. <a href="http://www.mobilewhack.com/reviews/lg_mg810_gets_fcc_nod.html">MobileWhack</a> reported that the MG810 phone received FCC approval back in March, 2006.</font></p>
