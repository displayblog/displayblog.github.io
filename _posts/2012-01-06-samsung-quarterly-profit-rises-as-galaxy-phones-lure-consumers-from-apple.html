<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-05/samsung-profit-beat-estimates-as-galaxy-phones-lure-consumers-from-apple.html">Jun Yang, Bloomberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mobile-phone sales surpassed a record 300 million units last year as Galaxy smartphones helped win consumers amid competition with Apple Inc.&acirc;&euro;&trade;s iPhone.</blockquote></p>
<p>This is how I'm reading this: In the Galaxy versus iPhone competition Samsung took away customers from Apple. I am sure there were some folks who considered buying an iPhone but ended up buying a Galaxy-branded smartphone instead. But in a 1:1 duel I'm also sure the iPhone kicked the Galaxy's butt out to space. <a href="http://parislemon.com/post/15418182445/one-out-of-three-aint-bad">MG Siegler</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Does the article offer any proof that Samsung is doing well because they stole customers from Apple? No. Is there any proof? I doubt it. Unless you believe that the 30+ million iPhones sold last quarter (yet to be announced) should have been more like 40 million [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>Yang:</p>
<blockquote><p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;The mobile business is generating a huge chunk of profit now,&acirc;&euro; James Song, a Seoul-based analyst at Daewoo Securities Co., said by telephone. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;It may be getting harder for Apple to catch up because they only have a limited number of models.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>Hmm. The most important metric for a company is not unit-based market share; it is profits. Samsung makes hundreds of phones, most of them junk; Apple makes three, all of them game changers and generating lots of profits, more profits than Samsung. And I am certain Apple isn't interested in catching up to Samsung in terms of mobile phone unit market share because that's a meaningless performance metric.</p>
<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/01/spaghetti_against_the_wall">John Gruber</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What proof is there that a multitude of models is more profitable? There seems to be plenty of proof &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; in the form of Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s financial results &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; that the opposite is true. With fewer models, combined with huge volume and a marketing strategy wherein Apple keeps selling and producing years-old models at lower price points, Apple achieves an economy of scale that none of its competitors can match.</blockquote></p>
<p>None so far anyway.</p>
