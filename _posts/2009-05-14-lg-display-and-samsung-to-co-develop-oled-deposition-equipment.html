This is according to an announcement on May 15, 2009 by the Korea Display Industry Association (KDIA). Last year these two companies worked together on manufacturing digital exposure equipment. In the future, LG Display and Samsung will expand their R&amp;D cooperation into next-generation display processing technology and core materials source technology.</p>
<p>OLED deposition methods must be suited for large-area and roll-to-roll processing to significantly improve the chance for OLED to realize widespread commercial use as a light source or display. It is somewhat strange that LG Display and Samsung are working together to research and develop OLED deposition equipment, which will undoubtedly be a crucial step toward commercializing OLED technology for displays and lighting. All major LCD manufacturers are racing to develop OLED, touted as the next-generation display technology.</p>
<p>The benefits of OLED displays are clear: low-power, extremely high contrast, ultra-thin and organic. There are many challenges that remain including: differential aging of organic materials, fast and stable electron manipulation across large substrates, cost of manufacturing, etc.</p>
