<p style="text-align: left;">The VAIO Z notebook PC drop test with the lid closed liftsthe Z up 2.95 feet (90cm) and drops it. The test is performed on three surfaces: bottom, side and front. The result? The Z chassis remained intact and booted up with normal operation. The drop test with the lid opened involves taking the Z up to 2.36 feet (72cm) and then dropping it while the Z was running and open. The result? Chassis intact as is the functionality. The Z shock test? The front, bottom and sides of the Z is struck against a solid surface. Result? No problems with the chassis, booted up OK and operations were normal. The open/close lid test involves doing it repeatedly for 11,000 times. The hinges and LCD is fully functioning afterwards.&Acirc;&nbsp;<a href="http://b2b.sony.com/vaio/durability/durability_videos.html?vid=3">Check out the videos here</a>.</p></p>
