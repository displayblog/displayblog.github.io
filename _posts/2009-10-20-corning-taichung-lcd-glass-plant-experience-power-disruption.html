  glass</a> plant located in the Central Taiwan Science Park, Taichung, Taiwan
  experienced a power disruption over the weekend from October 17 through October
  18. The power disruption affected some of its glass manufacturing operations. The
  supply of LCD glass will have a negative impact on volume shipments in the fourth
  quarter for Corning.\r\n<blockquote>The majority of our Taichung glass production
  continues to operate normally. However the power disruption caused the shutdown
  of several of our glass melting tanks. We are in the process of determining how
  much glass melting capacity was affected, the time to repair the tanks, and the
  impact on our glass volume available for customers. We are doing everything possible
  to accelerate repairs and leverage our worldwide supply chain to secure additional
  glass supply.</blockquote>\r\n<strong>Flat in Q4</strong> That's according
  to James B. Flaws, vice chairman and CFO of Corning. Initial estimates by the company
  put fourth quarter glass volume as sequentially flat or slightly down from third
  quarter shipments. "

<strong>Flat in Q4</strong> That's according to James B. Flaws, vice chairman and CFO of Corning. Initial estimates by the company put fourth quarter glass volume as sequentially flat or slightly down from third quarter shipments. <a id="more"></a><a id="more-7443"></a></p>
<p><strong>AU Optronics</strong> Corning's power disruption will mainly affect Taiwan-based LCD manufacturers that operate G6 and G7 production lines for the short term. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=au+optronics&amp;sa=Search#1255">AU Optronics</a> (AUO) is expected to experience the most impact. According to AUO there has not been any shipment delay notifications for LCD glass substrates from Corning.</p>
<p><strong>Timing</strong> About 60% (and growing) of LCD glass demand comes from <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=lcd+tv&amp;sa=Search#1333">LCD TV</a> applications. With the long supply chain associated with building LCD TVs, most of the demand for LCD glass as well as LCD panels are dropping now. The LCD TVs that will be on shelves are now being integrated and distributed through the channels. Corning's power disruption and eventual negative impact on LCD glass volume shipments might have come at the right time as overall demand for LCD glass dwindles.</p>
