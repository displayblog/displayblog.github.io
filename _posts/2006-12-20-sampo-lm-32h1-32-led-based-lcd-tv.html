<p>Sampo's LM-32H1 is a 32" LCD TV that eschews standard CCFLs for LEDs. With a LED-based backlight system, the LCD panel is only 30% the thickness of typical LCD TV panels. The lifetime of the LM-32H1 is expected to be 100,000 hours, double that of typical CCFL-based LCD TVs.</p>

<p>The technology is impressive, especially by a lesser brand such as Sampo. But if you're going to put so much technology in it, make sure to have a good camera and a good photographer. The image of the TV probably does not do the LM-32H1 much justic. That said, if the price of the LM-32H1 is under $1500, I think they will be a big hit; much more than that and I think consumers will just get the larger 37" or 40" LCD TVs. Price premiums for advanced technology has a limit, especially if it isn't backed by a strong brand name.</p>
