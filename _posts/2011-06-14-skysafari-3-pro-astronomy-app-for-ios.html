<p>Tim DeBenedictis, Founder/Owner of <a href="http://www.southernstars.com/index.html">Southern Stars</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Pro version has the largest database of any astronomy app, ever. Weighing in at 500 MB, it includes 15 million stars from the Hubble Guide Star catalog; 740,000 galaxies to 18th magnitude; and 550,000 solar system objects - including every comet and asteroid known to science.</blockquote></p>
<p>SkySafari is accurate: it was the only iOS astronomy app that correctly reproduced the total lunar eclipse that occurred last December. On June 15, the longest lunar eclipse since 2000 will occur over Europe, South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia. And for three days the basic version of SkySafari 3 originally priced at US$3 will be free, celebrating the app's second birthday. The timing can't be better.</p>

<p>This is SkySafari Pro in "Night" setting.</p>

<p>Around the center of the screen you can see a reddish dot: Mars.</p>

<p>If you continue to zoom in you can get to this full screen view of Mars. Zoom in even further and you can even get to see the surface.</p>

<p>The app's top recommendation for star gazers in San Jose, CA tonight is the Beehive Cluster. The screenshot above is what it would look like up in the night sky.</p>

<p>Here's a closer look at the Beehive Cluster.</p>

<p>A bit closer.</p>

<p>And you can keep going quite a bit.</p>
<p>I can imagine spending countless hours with SkySafari Pro: there are 740,000 galaxies, 550,000 solar system objects, and 15 million stars!</p>
<p>The Pro version is $60, the Plus version is $15, and the basic version is $3 but free for three days. And until June 21 all three versions are half off. Here's the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skysafari-3/id437108143?mt=8">link to SkySafari 3 on iTunes</a>. For those of you with a telescope you can turn your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch into a telescope controller with SkyWire, an RS-232 cable that connects an iDevice to a telescope. The Plus or Pro version is required.</p>
<p>Southern Stars has literally packed the entire universe into the palm of your hands with SkySafari.</p>
