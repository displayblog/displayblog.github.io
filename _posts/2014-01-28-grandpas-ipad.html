<blockquote><p>The iPad was a gift from my aunt. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a 3rd generation and she doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t use it that often so she gave it to him hoping he could use it. (Perhaps as a giant remote control for the TV?)</p>
<p>But my Grandpa discovered a use for it that none of us had considered. It is the best camera he&acirc;&euro;&trade;s ever owned.</blockquote></p>
<p>Makes sense. The 9.7-inch display as a viewfinder is great for those with less-than-perfect eyesight. And unlike almost all cameras out there with photo, video, review switches complicating things, taking a photo on the iPad is super easy.</p>
