<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/09/19/mock">John Gruber</a>. Swatch inventor <a href="http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swatch-inventor--swiss-watch-industry-missed-the-smartwatch-boat/40606754">Elmar Mock</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Apple Watch is by far the most attractive of the smartwatches. I would definitely wear it.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Switzerland lacks a Steve Jobs who can drag the watch industry into the future. It doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t necessarily mean the industry is on the wrong path, but it does mean that it has missed the boat as far as smartwatches are concerned.</blockquote></p>
<p>Speedboats &mdash; Apple, LG, Motorola, Samsung, Sony, etc. &mdash; have left the dock. Some have been innovating outwardly, some have been innovating inside company walls, but all those aforementioned high-tech companies are racing to build smarter watches.</p>
