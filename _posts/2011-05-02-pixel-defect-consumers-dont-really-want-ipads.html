<p>I'm starting Pixel Defect, a post title, with the dumbest things I've read as the content. Anonymous on <a href="http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2011/05/02/apple-piper-says-intel-should-make-their-chips/">Barron's</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Consumers don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t really want iPads running some light iOS operating system. Consumers are clamoring for tablets running a full Windows OS. Something really beefy and full-featured to check their emails and browse the internet with.</blockquote></p>
