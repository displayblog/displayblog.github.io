<p>On October 13, 2008, Acer unveiled its 24" 1080p LCD Monitor: P244W. The 24" LCD monitor is an unique 24" LCD monitor in that the aspect ratio is 16:9 instead of the usual 16:10. The pixel format is 1920 x 1080, ideal for watching HD content, according to Acer. In my opinion, I do much more work than I watch HD content on monitors, so I'm not sure if this is a trend that I am liking. Please give me back the 120 extra vertical pixels. The P244W has some cool features such as its SensorTouch technology that allows you to change settings by just touching the LED illuminated controls. The 2ms is achieved by Acer's overdrive technology that improves the gray-to-gray response time. Just make sure you know what you're getting into: the viewing angles are 170/160 which means that this LCD uses TN technology.</p>
