<p>Panasonic claims to be the first company to completely eliminate lead in plasma display panels. The Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) directive is now law in most of the EU's 25 countries and has prohibited the use of lead in PDP glass. Panasonic's new plasma TV lineup that was launched in Europe and the US earlier this spring all have lead-free PDPs. Although I am not by any stretch of the imagination a tree-hugger, I do appreciate companies transitioning from hazardous materials to ones that are less harmful. Lead oxide glass is used for the dielectric layer, electrodes, seal frit and other structural elements of a PDP and Matsushita (Panasonic's mother company) has been able to develop new materials and processes that minimize the performance impact.
