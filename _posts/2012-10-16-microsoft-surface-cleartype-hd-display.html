<p>Anand Lai Shimpi, <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6377/inside-microsofts-surface-rt-tablet">AnandTech</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Although Surface RT only ships with a 1366 x 768 panel, Microsoft was quick to point out that there&acirc;&euro;&trade;s more to display quality than pure resolution.</blockquote></p>
<p>That's what you say when you don't have enough pixels, but he does have a point.</p>
<blockquote><p>Surface&acirc;&euro;&trade;s 10.6-inch panel features an optically bonded LCD and cover glass stack, similar to what we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve seen in most modern, high-end smartphones. Optical bonding is expensive to do and not as common in large tablet panels, but Microsoft believes it can do so at reasonable yields on Surface.</blockquote></p>
<p>The iPad's cover glass isn't optically bonded to the LCD, and it shows. The Surface ClearType HD display is a step ahead.</p>
<blockquote><p>The optically bonded cover glass + LCD stack reduces internal reflections, thus reducing glare and increasing light transmission.</blockquote></p>
<p>The difference between a display with an optically bonded cover glass can be easily seen by comparing the iPhone 4 and the iPad.</p>
<blockquote><p>One clever trick is that Microsoft, through various coatings, index matches between the touch sensor&acirc;&euro;&trade;s ITO (Indium Tin Oxide) array and the cover glass, once again in pursuit of fewer reflections.</blockquote></p>
<p>This is definitely clever, but a trick nonetheless. The better solution would have been to <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2012/10/16/iphone-5-in-cell-touch/">go with in-cell touch, which is what Apple did with the iPhone 5</a>.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.10.29:</em> <a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Microsoft+Surface+Teardown/11275/3">iFixit</a> tore down the Surface and found the 10.6-inch ClearType HD Display to be supplied by Samsung with model number LT106AL01-002.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.11.12:</em> <a href="http://www.displaymate.com/Surface_RT_ShootOut_1.htm">Raymond Soneira</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The display on the Microsoft Surface RT outperforms all of the standard resolution full size 10 inch Tablets that we have tested in our Display Shoot-Out series. The Lab tests and measurements documented in the Shoot-Out Comparison Table indicate that Microsoft has paid a lot of attention to display performance for the Surface RT. In particular, on-screen text is significantly sharper, it has a better factory display calibration, and also significantly lower screen Reflectance than the iPad 2 and all full size 1280x800 Android Tablets. But it is not as sharp as the iPad 3 or 4, nor does it have their large full Color Gamut.</blockquote></p>
<p>The 10.6-inch 1366x768 ClearType HD Display used in the Microsoft Surface RT is the best there is among 10-inch tablets with non-retina displays. The only problem is the $499 10-inch tablet world has moved on, to retina displays. Even the smaller Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8.9" sports a 1920x1200 pixel format for just $299. The Google Nexus 10 is $100 less and packs in 2560x1600 pixels. But at $499 Surface RT is really going up against the $499 iPad, which sports a brilliant 9.7-inch 2048x1536 LCD. The display makes the tablet. Microsoft fell short with the 10.6-inch 1366x768 ClearType HD Display and is asking too much for its Surface RT.</p>
