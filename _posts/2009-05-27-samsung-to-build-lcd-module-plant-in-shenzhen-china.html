<p><strong>Low &amp; Big</strong> China has at least two major factors going for it. One is the lower cost of manual labor compared to the rest of the world. Second is the vast potential market for LCD TVs. There are many LCD module plants that have located in China in the last 7 to 8 years due to low cost of manual labor. Now and in the future LCD manufacturers will increasingly locate their LCD module plants due to the promixity to potentially the largest LCD TV market in the world. It also helps that the world's largest TV integrators are located in China as well.</p>
