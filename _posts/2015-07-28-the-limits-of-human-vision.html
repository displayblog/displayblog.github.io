<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150727-what-are-the-limits-of-human-vision">Adam Hadhazy, BBC</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A million colours; single photons; galactic realms quintillions of miles distant &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; not bad for the blobs of jelly in our eye sockets, wired to a 1.4 kilogram sponge in our skulls.</blockquote></p>
<p>To add a bit of context:</p>
<ul>
<li>Photon wavelengths: about 380 to 720 nanometers</li>
<li>Colors: about 1,000,000 (100 color shades per cone x 3 cones)*</li>
<li>Sensitivity: one photon</li>
<li>Distance: one photon (as long as a photon reaches our retina)</li>
<li>Visual Acuity: 120 pixels per degree of arc (fingernail at arm's length with 60 horizontal and 60 vertical lines)</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Our visual system is quite a remarkable design.</p>
<p>* Tetrachromats are people who have an extra fourth cone cell allowing them to perceive 100 million colors.</p>
