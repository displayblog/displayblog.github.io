<p>Not much information is out there regarding LGE&acirc;&euro;&trade;s C1 convertible tablet PC. Sources are guessing the C1 will be powered by Intel&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Core Duo CPU or Core 2 Duo and an nVidia GPU. There is a SIM card slot for GSM-based data communications. The display is a 10&acirc;&euro;&sup3; wide according to some. Sony&acirc;&euro;&trade;s TX is 11.1&acirc;&euro;&sup3; wide and if LGE&acirc;&euro;&trade;s C1 is smaller than that&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; and is a convertible table PC, then, wow.</p>
