<p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html">Paul Graham</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Whichever route you take, expect a struggle. Finding work you love is very difficult. Most people fail. Even if you succeed, it's rare to be free to work on what you want till your thirties or forties. But if you have the destination in sight you'll be more likely to arrive at it. If you know you can love work, you're in the home stretch, and if you know what work you love, you're practically there.</blockquote></p>
<p>Doing what you love is a start, but to persist you need to love what you're doing.</p>
