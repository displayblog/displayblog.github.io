<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/26/5348258/foxconn-could-start-manufacturing-large-displays-in-the-us">Chris Ziegler, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>At an event commemorating its 40th anniversary this weekend, Foxconn boss Terry Gou mentioned that the company is exploring the possibility of opening a display manufacturing plant in the US that could produce screens larger than 60 inches, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303277704579344013148753716"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reports</a>. Spurring the exploration, apparently, is the difficulty of shipping panels that large to the US from Asia, where most are currently produced.</blockquote></p>
<p>I don't think shipping large TV panels is difficult; it is however costly (air), and takes a lot of time (boat). Plus, to save on taxes, these TV panels are shipped to Mexico. Once the 60-inch LCD is integrated into a TV chassis it is then trucked over to the U.S. to a major hub. Cumbersome yes, but why would Foxconn consider building a large LCD manufacturing plant in the U.S. when there is only one major TV brand &mdash; Vizio &mdash; in the U.S.? Maybe there's going to be two.</p>
