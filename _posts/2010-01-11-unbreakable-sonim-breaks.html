<p>Reporter Dan Simmons from the BBC's technology show Click managed to break a Sonim phone, which was touted by the company's CEO moments ago as "basically unbreakable" and if you do manage to break it you get a free phone. Dan, from what I can tell, was certainly not expecting it to break. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/click_online/8450385.stm">Watch the video</a>.
