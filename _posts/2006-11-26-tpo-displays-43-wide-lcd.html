<p>The 4.3" wide TFT LCD has a resolution of 800 x 480 and is made by TPO Displays. FYI, TPO was created by merging Toppoly and Philips' small/medium LCD operation. TPO is expecting 30K-60K unit shipments of its 4.3" LCD in 2007. In my opinion, the 4.3" has a resolution that will enable viewing of DVD-quality movies in a unit about the size of the PlayStation Portable (PSP). Currently the PSP has a resolution of only 480 x 272. Hmm. A PSP spec bump to 800 x 480 with a slide up screen and QWERTY keyboard? That would be nice. Yes, kill off the mylo.</p>
