<blockquote><p>And just like that, it's open. No clips, just tons of glue.</p>
<p>As much as we hated trying to remove the clips in the original iPad, this much adhesive is even more of a pain. Be ready to crack your front panel if you dare open it! We'll be investigating the best way to get inside over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>A few screws here and there hold down the LCD screen. Not a problem for the iFixit team!</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple seems to love glue. <a href="/2011/03/02/rahul-sood-macbook-manifesto/">I've shared this before</a> but when I cracked open a defective Bluetooth keyboard, the entire bottom panel was secured by tons of glue. Steve Jobs is known to hate screws, so glue it is.</p>
<p>The LCD looks to be a module, which is different from what you get when you open up the 11.6-inch MacBook Air: <a href="/2010/10/28/11-6-inch-macbook-air-lcd-cell-backlight-and-nothing-else/">the LCD is just the LCD cell and the backlight</a> without the fattening module around it. This design points to a future <a href="/2011/02/10/ipad-3/">iPad 3</a> that could be <em>even</em> thinner.</p>
