<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSSGE6BC0CM20101214">Reuters</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dec 14 (Reuters) - Toshiba Corp (6502.T) will spend about 100 billion yen ($1.19 billion) to build a factory to make small LCD panels, mainly to supply to Apple Inc (AAPL.O) for use in iPhones, the Nikkei business daily said on Tuesday.</blockquote></p>
<p>Nikkei reported that Toshiba Mobile Display (TMD) will begin building a LTPS (Low-Temperature Poly-Silicon) LCD plant in Japan's Ishikawa Prefecture early next year. Mass production is slated to commence in the second half of 2011. Apple is reportedly an investor in the LCD fab. A Toshiba spokesperson claims the Nikkei report is untrue.</p>
<p>I don't know whether this is true or not, but I have my doubts. TMD does not have IPS technology, a feature Apple has been touting lately with the iPhone 4, iPad, iMac, and Cinema displays. The next iPhone will need to maintain the display quality of the iPhone 4: currently there is nothing better than the 3.5-inch 960x640 IPS LCD Retina Display.</p>
<p>Most of the IPS LCDs that Apple uses are manufactured by LG Display (LGD). To invest in a future TMD plant would be unwise. The smart move: build a small R&D LCD plant near Cupertino with LGD.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> According to <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2010/12/17/apple-and-sharp-building-1-2-billion-facility-for-iphone-displays/">MacRumors</a>, Nikkei is now re-running the same article but with Toshiba replaced with Sharp. This makes more sense since Sharp unveiled a 3.5-inch LCD with a 960x640 pixel format in its IS03 smartphone (read <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/10/04/sharp-is03-3-5-inch-960x640-asv-lcd/">Sharp IS03: 3.5-inch 960x640 ASV LCD</a>). And since Retina Display doesn't need to be IPS, the Advanced Super View (ASV) LCD by Sharp qualifies (read <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/11/22/apples-retina-display-what-is-it-really/">Apple's Retina Display: What is it really?</a>).</p>
