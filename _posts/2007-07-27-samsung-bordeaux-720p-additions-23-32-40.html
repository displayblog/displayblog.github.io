<p>Samsung adds three more to its Bordeaux line of LCD TVs. All three have a pixel format of 1366 x 768. Not quite 720p since the scaler chip inside of the set will need to scale the video up from 1280 x 720 to 1366 x 768. As mentioned in a number of previous posts, scaling any video image is not as good as leaving it alone. But, scaler technology has gotten so good, you'll need a very good idea to catch the difference. The three new 720p models come in three sizes: 23", 32" and 40". All two larger LCD TVs sport a contrast ratio of 8000:1 and a brightness of 550 cd/m2. The 23" has a respectable 4000:1 contrast ratio and a slightly less bright, but still quite bright, 450 cd/m2. Prices are fairly competitive as well: the 23" comes in at ~$600, the 32" at ~$800 and the 40" is ~$1400. Unless I was looking for a LCD TV for the bedroom, I wouldn't go less than 32". The 32" at about $800 is a decent price, but hopefully Samsung will lower the price even more around Black Friday. I would like to see a 720p 40" by major brands such as Samsung to hit $999 by Black Friday.</p>

The 23" (LN23R81B, W?) is definitely geared for a bedroom with a white enclosure and the size. It looks quite cute but for $600 is a bit on the expensive side.</p>

The 32" (LN32R81B) looks stylish, but I do believe the glowing blue light become a distraction when you're trying to enjoy a nice movie at night. It is a simple design standard not to have bright dots, glows, etc. on the front of the screen, especially when the company worked so hard to give you that dark screen look with a black bezel.</p>

The 40" (LN40R81B) seems to have the same design as the 32" and the same critique applies. Although upon looking a bit closer, the glowing blue light seems to be relatively less bright. It might be the way the picture was taken in addition to the 40" being a larger TV. However, I really would like to speak to the design guys at Samsung: please, hold the glowing blue light. I don't need to know the TV is on. I already know it's on because I'm watching a show. In Korea, Samsung's sub-brand for TVs are called PAVV. You can find quite a bit more information about the new 81 Series 720p LCD TVs at the Korean site.</p>
