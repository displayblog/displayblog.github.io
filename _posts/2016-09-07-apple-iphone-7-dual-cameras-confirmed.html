<p>[ <a href="http://gizmodo.com/amazon-just-blew-the-lid-on-the-iphone-7-1786326033">Gizmodo</a> ] Amazon accidentally went live with a page for iPhone 7 cases, accessories, and Bluetooth headphones. In one of the case photos -- a Speck case to be more specific -- the iPhone 7 has dual cameras. Other smartphones already feature dual cameras to enhance photo quality.</p>
<p>The LG G5 has two cameras. One is a regular 16 megapixel camera but the second camera is a 135-degree wide angle lens. The Huawei P9 pairs&nbsp;the second camera with a monochrome image sensor, which can capture more detail. Both photos are later combined.</p>
<p>It seems&nbsp;Apple will be announcing at least one iPhone 7 model -- most likely the iPhone 7 Plus -- with dual cameras. But how Apple will use the second camera to enhance photos is still a mystery.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> Confirmed. The iPhone 7 Plus has dual cameras. Two 12 megapixel cameras. One has a wide angle and the other has a 56mm telephoto lens. With dual cameras you can now 2x zoom, optically. With up to 10x digital zoom. I wonder how good the digital zoom is.</p>
<p>Digitally generated bokeh is&nbsp;available in Portrait mode. Looks impressive. This feature will come with an update later.</p>
