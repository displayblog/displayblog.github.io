<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/11/the-fourth-generation-ipads-new-gpu-is-a-quad-core-monster/">Ars Technica</a>: The iPad (4) is basically the same as the iPad (3) on the outside, except for the Lightning connector. But on the inside Apple changed out the brain for a better one. The iPad (4) is powered by a new A6X CPU. Samsung manufactures the 30% larger A6X using a 32nm process. Four GPU cores much larger than the cores in the A6 (SGX543MP4) take up almost all of the increased space. And those monster GPU cores make a big difference. Anand Lai Shimpi, <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6426/ipad-4-gpu-performance-analyzed-powervr-sgx-554mp4-under-the-hood">AnandTech</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ultimately it looks like the A6X is the SoC that the iPad needed to really deliver good gaming performance at its native resolution. I would not be surprised to see more game developers default to 2048 x 1536 on the new iPad rather than picking a lower resolution and enabling anti-aliasing. The bar has been set for this generation and we've seen what ARM's latest GPU can do [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>When it comes to graphics intensive apps taking advantage of all 2048x1536 pixels the iPad (4) is roughly twice as fast as the iPad (3). That's good, but if you have accumulated a lot of peripherals for your iPad ask yourself this question: Is twice the graphics performance worth the hassle and cost of having to replace all my 30-pin peripherals with Lightning ones? Me? I only have a seldom used Apple Bluetooth keyboard, but nah, I'm quite happy with my iPad (3). And it's too soon.</p>
<p>PS: Forgot one thing. The front camera (640x480) has been upgraded to FaceTime HD (720p).</p>
