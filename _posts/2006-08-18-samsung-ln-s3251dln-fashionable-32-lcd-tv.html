<p>Samsung's LN-S3252D is an eye-catching 32" LCD TV that also boasts impressive front-screen performance. At least that's what <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/Samsung_LN_S3252D/4505-6482_7-31785797.html">c|net</a> says. From the looks of the LN-S3252D (what a name!) the white bezel does make the TV look a lot friendlier than the all aluminum or black units that populate places like Best Buy.</p>
<p>The 32" LCD is limited to only 1366 x 768 resolution. Which means that any HD or SD video input will need to be scaled. Although scaling chips today are very good at what they do, I would like to see a 1280 x 720 resolution standard where at least 720p content does not have to be scaled. 1920 x 1080 would have been much nicer. And I don't care if some folks tell me my eyes can't decipher Full HD resolution in a 32" box... I still want one.</p>

<p>Although the resolution is low, the response times are on the fast side with 8ms. Viewing angles are very good at 178 degrees and brightness is 500 cd/m2 or nits. Another pretty good feature is the two HDMI ports. There are a lot of other video inputs, but really, if you have HDMI you wouldn't want to use the other ports. This unit has a VGA port to hook up your computer, but do you really want to do that with a 32" LCD screen that has a resolution of only 1366 x 768? I guess if you need gigantic fonts. Overall, I am glad these CE companies are coming out with colors that are not aluminum or black. White is nice. Let's get on to some other colors too...</p>
