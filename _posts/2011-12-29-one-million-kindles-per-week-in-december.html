<p><a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20111229005169/en/2011-Holiday-Kindle">Amazon</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Throughout December, customers purchased well over 1 million Kindle devices per week.</blockquote></p>
<p>December isn't over yet, but assuming the one million per week rate continues throughout the last week of December we're looking at four million Kindles sold. <a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/12/29/amazon-may-miss-q4-sales-despite-selling-one-million-kindles">Marco Arment counts a total of 10 Kindle models</a>. To be the best selling Kindle out of those 10 models the sales number for the Kindle Fire for the month of December will have to be at least 400,001. <a href="http://david-smith.org/blog/2011/12/17/estimating-kindle-sales/">David Smith estimates that number at 780,000 per week</a> or 3.12 million for the month. I wonder why Amazon doesn't just come out and say how many Kindle Fires it sold.</p>
<p><a href="http://parislemon.com/post/14983528210/amazons-december-kindle-sales-somewhere-between-4">MG Siegler</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I view the Kindle Fire and the iPad as different devices and so do many people. But as tablets, they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re inevitably going to be compared. And I think it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s fair to think that many people bought one instead of the other this holiday season. With that in mind, Amazon probably wouldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t want to release concrete numbers that get blown away by a competitor. Especially when the competitor is selling their device for $300 more.</blockquote></p>
<p>Smith:</p>
<blockquote><p>Assuming the sales bump the iPad got last Christmas, where sales were 75% higher than the preceding quarter, Apple may be selling as many as 1,600,000/week right now.</blockquote></p>
<p>Maybe that's why Amazon isn't saying.</p>
