<p>Prime View International (PVI) has changed its name to E Ink Holdings. All products from now will be sold with the E Ink brand. Back in 2009, PVI purchased E Ink, the US company best known for trailblazing the electronic paper display (EPD) market. Most e-book readers, including Amazon's Kindle, currently on the market today incorporates the EPD based on E Ink technology. This sounds like a good move by PVI since it isn't a household name and E Ink is.</p>
