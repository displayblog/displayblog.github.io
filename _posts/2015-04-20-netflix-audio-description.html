<p><a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2015/04/netflix-begins-audio-description-for.html">Netflix</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Audio description is a narration track that describes what is happening on-screen, including physical actions, facial expressions, costumes, settings and scene changes. Customers can choose audio narration just like choosing the soundtrack in a different language.</blockquote></p>
<p>Video already has audio, but there's a lot of things that go on that can be missed for those who are visually impaired. This should help a great deal to fill in those blanks. Good job Netflix.</p>
