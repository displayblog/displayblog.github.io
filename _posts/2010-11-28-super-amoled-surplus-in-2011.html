<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20101126PD211.html">DigiTimes</a> &rarr; <a href="http://www.phonearena.com/news/The-AMOLED-and-OLED-shorages-are-soon-to-be-a-thing-of-the-past-as-Far-East-companies-are-to-start-mass-production_id14917">Phone Arena</a> &rarr; <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/28/amoled-shortage-to-become-a-surplus-in-2011/">Engadget</a>: Samsung Mobile Display (SMD) makes the Super AMOLED displays that go into every Samsung branded smartphone. Currently SMD makes 3 million of these per month. Starting June 2011 that number will grow to 30 million per month. But these aren't regular OLED displays: SMD's Super AMOLEDs make use of a PenTile Matrix sub-pixel structure pioneered by Clairvoyante and now Nouvoyance after being purchased by Samsung. PenTile Matrix has a 2x2 sub-pixel structure that allows for a visual equivalent pixel format of 800xRGBx480. As far as I know there is no OLED volume production technology that can cram 800xRGBx480 pixels into a 3.5-inch panel.</p>
<p>These reports stating that AU Optronics (AUO), Chimei Innolux (CMI) and other China-based display manufacturers are getting in the mobile OLED display game is absurd. They will not be able to get to 800x480; maybe they are thinking of putting expensive OLED displays into budget smartphones? The only way AUO, CMI and other China-based suppliers can be competitive is if all of them licensed PenTile Matrix from Nouvoyance.</p>
