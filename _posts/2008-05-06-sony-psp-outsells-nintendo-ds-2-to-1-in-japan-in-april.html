<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/ousiv/idUST3777720080502">Reuters</a>: According to <a href="http://www.enterbrain.co.jp/index_en.html">Enterbrain</a>, a Japan game magazine publisher, in April <a href="http://www.us.playstation.com/psp/landing.aspx?ref=http%3A//www.sony.com/index.php#/start/">Sony's PlayStation Portable (PSP)</a> outsold Nintendo's DS by more than 2-to-1 in Japan. The PSP sold 380,867 units while the DS sold just 169,911. Capcom's "Monster Hunter Freedom 2G" was the hottest game for the PSP for the second consecutive month according to Enterbrain.</p>
<p>The results were reversed for the console market where <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/wii">Nintendo's Wii</a> outsold Sony's PlayStation 3 (PS3) by 5-to-1 in the four weeks through April 27. The Wii sold 187,121 units while the PS3 posted just 37,676 units in April. The Wii has been leading the PS3 in sales since their launches in late 2006. The Wii is popular with almost everyone including women and the elderly while the PS3 is mostly prized by younger more tech-savvy consumers. I personally enjoy playing on the Wii (a few hours each month) much more than any other console and so does my son.</p>
<p>This is very interesting as I would have thought that with the high definition DVD war over between Sony and Toshiba that Sony's PS3 and other Blu-ray players would fly off the shelves. I guess that is not the case. In my opinion, I think the main barrier to faster adoption of Blu-ray and the PS3 is the price: it is just too high compared to a 1080p up-converting DVD player and the viewing experience for just a fraction of the cost of Blu-ray.</p>
