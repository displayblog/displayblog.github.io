<p><a href="http://www.idc.com/about/viewpressrelease.jsp?containerId=prUS22560610&sectionId=null&elementId=null&pageType=SYNOPSIS">IDC</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple marked a new milestone in iPhone shipments, enough to take the number 2 ranking worldwide. The third quarter is typically Apple's highest volume quarter, and 3Q10 was no exception. Consumers who did not get their iPhone 4 at the end of June were rewarded for their patience and even the much-hyped 'Antennagate' did little to dampen demand, as the company moved swiftly to provide solutions.</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple overtook RIM for #3. Of note, #4 Samsung posted the highest Y/Y growth thanks to the global launch of its Galaxy S smartphone featuring the highly-touted Super AMOLED display.</p>
