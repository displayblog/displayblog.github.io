<p>Dell's UltraSharp U3011 is a massive 30-inch LCD monitor sporting a 10-bit 2560x1600 IPS panel. That 10-bit means you've got a billion colors to play with. And that's a good thing because the U3011 will do a very good job displaying color with a 117% CIE 1976 color gamut. Viewing angles are terrific at 178 degrees while response times at 7ms can be a bit faster. Brightness is 370 cd/m2 and static contrast is 1000:1 with connectivity options that include two DVI-D ports, DisplayPort and two HDMIs. Price is a hefty US$1499.

<p>Now there is one thing: the backlight, as far as I can tell, is of the CCFL variety. I don't know about you but I'd prefer saving myself $500 and getting the slightly smaller <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/07/27/apple-27-inch-led-cinema-display-2560x1440-ips-lcd-led-backlight/">27-inch LED Cinema Display</a> from Apple even if it has 160 less vertical pixels.</p>
