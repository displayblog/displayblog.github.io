<p>I wasn't familiar with where Selangor, Malaysia was so thought I'd put up a map (courtesy of Google Earth). Click on the image and you should get a huge map and Selangor, Malaysia is right in the center of the image. IPS Alpha is 45% owned by Panasonic and 50% owned by Hitachi Displays. Hitachi Displays is 50% owned by Hitachi Ltd. and 25% each by Panasonic and Canon. So Panasonic's ownership of IPS Alpha totals 57.5% due to its part ownership of Hitachi Displays. Also as the name suggests IPS Alpha manufactures LCDs using In-Plane Switching (IPS) technology, which is known for great color fidelity and very wide viewing angles.</p>
