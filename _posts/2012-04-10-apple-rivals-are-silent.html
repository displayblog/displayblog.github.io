<p><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/disruptions-on-worker-conditions-apples-rivals-are-silent/?smid=tw-nytimes&seid=auto&pagewanted=all">Nick Bilton, The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s rivals are quick to say how much better, faster, cheaper or more popular their smartphones, computers and tablets are.</p>
<p>Yet when it comes to working conditions in the Chinese factories that build these competing products, Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s electronics rivals have been silent lately.</blockquote></p>
