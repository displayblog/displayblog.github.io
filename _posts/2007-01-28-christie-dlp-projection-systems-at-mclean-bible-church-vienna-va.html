<p>McLean Bible Church, Vienna, VA tapped Christie to install a multi-projection DLP system to enhance visual experience in the church auditorium, smaller auditorium and church lobby. In the main auditorium, there are 15 systems that were installed; four systems were installed in the Smith Center and another four were installed in meeting rooms. All of these systems are monitored and controlled by ChristieNET&acirc;&bdquo;&cent; networking. Although I am not so thrilled at churches transitioning toward having more entertainment content instead of focusing on the Bible and praying, Christie's projection systems should enhance the visual experience for those attending McLean Bible Church.</p>
