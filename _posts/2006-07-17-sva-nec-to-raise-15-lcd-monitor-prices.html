<p>DigiTimes is reporting that China-based SVA-NEC will raise 15" LCD monitor prices by US$2-3 to US$95-96 in the second half of July. Because of a decrease in low-margin panel production and an increase in demand as US-based brands prepare for a strong third and fourth quarter, there is an upward pressure for 15" and 17" LCD monitor panel prices. 15" and 17" will be the most affordable products that monitor manufacturers like Dell and HP will offer consumers for back-to-school, Thanksgiving (Black Friday) and Christmas promotions. Most likely the prices of 15" LCD monitors will be around $149 while 17" sets will hit $199 by the major brands.</p>
<p>A higher panel price by $2-3 will not translate into set price increases. However, a panel price hike by about $10 will. The best time to grab a 15" or 17" LCD monitor might be right now to about a month out since those sets were manufactured with panels that were the cheapest in history, up to now.</p>
