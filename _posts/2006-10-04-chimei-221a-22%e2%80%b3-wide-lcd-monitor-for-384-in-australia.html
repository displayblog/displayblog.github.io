<p>Chimei&acirc;&euro;&trade;s 22&acirc;&euro;&sup3; wide LCD monitor, the 221A, is selling for $509 Australian dollars or US$384. The 221A has a 1680 x 1050 resolution and 5ms response time with a 800:1 contrast ratio. It is being distributed by Protac in Australia. The price is impressive considering a 20&acirc;&euro;&sup3; wide LCD monitor from Dell can cost about the same price.</p>

<p>The new standard sizes for wide LCD monitors will likely become 19&acirc;&euro;&sup3; wide with a resolution of 1440 x 900, 22&acirc;&euro;&sup3; wide with 1680 x 1050 and 24&acirc;&euro;&sup3; wide with 1920 x 1200. At the lower end, some LCD manufacturers are considering a 1280 x 720 resolution on a 17&acirc;&euro;&sup3; wide size.</p>
