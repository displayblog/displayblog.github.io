<p>Multiple sites are conjecturing that Apple will unveil a 11.6-inch MacBook Air in next week's "<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/10/13/apple-back-to-the-mac-event-october-20th/">Back to the Mac</a>" event. This smaller, lighter MacBook Air is expected to be more affordable, too. The current 13.3-inch MacBook Air starts at $1499.</p>
<p>The pixel format will probably remain the same at 1280x800. But I wonder if the 11.6-inch LCD will be of the IPS variety...</p>
