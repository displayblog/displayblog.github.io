<blockquote><p>Yet according to Leander Kahney, author of the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159184617X/?tag=fc-cult087-20"><em>Jony Ive: The Genius Behind Apple's Greatest Products</em></a>, Ive is not so different from many designers. "There are a lot of potential Jony Ives out there," says Kahney, "But none of them have access to the sort of resources that Ive has, or have found an advocate for their talents like Steve Jobs." If Apple's success has proven anything, it's that many designers can become the next Jony Ive, if their companies become their dream enablers. And the companies that do so may become the next Apple.</blockquote></p>
<p>I have a hard time believing Jony Ive is not extraordinarily different from many other designers. Given the right environment I <em>do</em> believe there are a few designers out there, who can have an effect on a company and on an industry as big as Ive has on Apple and in the computer and consumer electronics industries.</p>
