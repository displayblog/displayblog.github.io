<p><a href="http://www.cnet.com.au/desktops/monitors/0,239029422,339294389,00.htm">CNET</a>: The Dell 2209WA is a 22" LCD monitor that sports an e-IPS (In-Plane Switching) LCD panel. The 'e' prefix probably denotes 'economy' and makes IPS LCD panels a lot more affordable. The price is AU$459 or right around US$300: a bit on the expensive side for a 22" LCD monitor but we'll see if the price is worth it.</p>
<p>I believe the 2209WA is the first 22" with an IPS LCD... actually Apple's 22" LCD monitor from a very long time ago would be the very first. IPS LCD panels geared for LCD monitors are mostly manufactured by LG Display (LPL). Hitachi, IPS Alpha and HannStar are others that also supply IPS LCD panels. (Full disclosure: I used to work at LG Display but no longer do.)</p>
<p>Viewing angles are very wide at 178/178 but that's only half the story: colors shift very little at wide angles, a feature not all LCD panels can claim. The 6ms response time is good but not ultra-fast; 1000:1 contrast is very good on a monitor; the 300 cd/m2 of brightness is quite bright (you'd want to dim it a bit). The 2209WA comes with two connections: DVI and VGA.</p>
<p>I would like to see a 22" IPS version with a 1920x1200 pixel format: that would make it THE best 22" LCD monitor. CNET AU did a quick review and stated that, "This is the best 22-inch monitor we've seen."</p>
