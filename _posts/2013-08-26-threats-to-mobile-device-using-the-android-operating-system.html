<p><a href="http://info.publicintelligence.net/DHS-FBI-AndroidThreats.pdf">Public Intelligence (PDF)</a>: The US Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice published a report on malware threats to mobile operating systems in 2012. 79% of malware threats on mobile operating systems were on Android, 19% on Symbian, 0.7% on iOS, and 0.3% on Windows Mobile and BlackBerry. What is surprising is how small the number is for iOS considering its market share.</p>
