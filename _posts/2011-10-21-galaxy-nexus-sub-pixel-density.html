<blockquote><p>I wager that if you were satisfied with the pixel density of SGS2 that the pixel density Galaxy Nexus actually won't be off-putting despite the presence of PenTile.</blockquote></p>
<p>The sub-pixel density for SGS2 is 383.09 while the Galaxy Nexus is higher at 414.33. The iPhone 4/4S packs 613.32.</p>
