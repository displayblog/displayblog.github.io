<p><a href="http://www.kmart.com/shc/s/p_10151_10104_020W026051760001P?vName=Computers+%26+Electronics&cName=Laptops&keyword=augen&prdNo=4&blockNo=4&blockType=G4">Kmart</a> is selling the Augen GenBook 108, a 10.2-inch netbook, for just $190. The LCD sports a 1024x600 pixel format. Other specs include: 800MHz ARM11 CPU, 256MB DDR RAM, WiFi BG, SD/MMC, 1.8 lbs, and a keyboard that's 93% full-sized. And it runs Android, without Android Market. I think this will be great for those wanting to buy toddlers a computer to play with.</p>
