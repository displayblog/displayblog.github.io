<p>The Toshiba REGZA 52RV530U is a 52" LCD TV with a pixel format of 1920x1080. The 52RV530U does not have all the bells and whistles but if you want a pretty decent and fairly large LCD TV for not a whole lot of money, you can do much worse. The 52RV530U has what is called DynaLight, which is a dynamic backlight control technology that improves the overall contrast ratio. I am not sure exactly how it works since the 52" Toshiba unit uses a CCFL backlight. If I were to guess, Toshiba is modulating the brightness of the entire frame. This is something quite different from local dimming, a technology that is enabled with the use of a LED backlight, which the 52RV530U does not have. PixelPure 4G is integrated and works with the 14-bit video processor to generate colors from a pallet of 4,096 colors for each sub-pixel, much more than the usual 256. There is also a Gaming Mode so latency is reduced when you require the fastest responses playing games. With a price of just <a href="http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3731247&amp;csid=ITD&amp;body=MAIN#detailspecs">$1499.99 at TigerDirect</a> the 52RV530U is a real bargain!</p>
