<p><a href="http://www.twice.com/article/CA6341217.html">Twice</a>: According to Twice, Toshiba will procure LCD panels from AUO and CMO. Contrary to what Twice is reporting, the LCD joint venture among Toshiba, Matsushita and Hitachi is not Alpha IPS, it is IPS Alpha. LG is providing plasma panels to Toshiba while there has been a 300% expansion in LCD TV final assembly at the company&#39;s TMX plant in Mexico where 26" and larger LCD TVs are assembled. Circuit-board assembly and plasma assembly has been moved to Asian factories. To ensure supply keeps pace with TV growth rates, new Asian plasma TV final assembly operations are being ramped up. Microdisplay models are shifting to 1080p, according to Scott Ramirez, VP Marketing, Toshiba TV.</p>
