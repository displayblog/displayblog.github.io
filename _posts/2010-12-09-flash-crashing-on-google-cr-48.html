<blockquote><p>Yep, that Flash error up there is one of many we got today on our Cr-48s. On top of that, as you may have read in our in-depth preview, we've been experiencing incredibly sluggish Flash performance, including choppy playback of YouTube and Hulu videos.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Flash error that Joanna Stern is referring to is a message on the Chrome browser stating the Flash plug-in has crashed.</p>
