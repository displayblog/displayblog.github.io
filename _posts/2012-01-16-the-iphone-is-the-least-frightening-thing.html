<blockquote><p>But Woz says he still recommends the iPhone as the best choice for most users. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;The people I recommend the iPhone 4S for are the ones who are already in the Mac world, because it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s so compatible, and people who are just scared of computers altogether and don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t want to use them. The iPhone is the least frightening thing. For that kind of person who is scared of complexity, well, here&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a phone that is simple to use and does what you need it to do,&acirc;&euro;¬ù he says.</blockquote></p>
<p>People are not scared of dog poop, right? Most people are not scared of complexity; they just don't want to deal with it. And for those people, who'd rather get things done than fiddle with a phone, the iPhone is best.</p>
