<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20111228PD215.html">DigiTimes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple is set to unveil its next-generation iPad &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; which will come in two versions &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; at the iWorld scheduled for January 26, 2012, according to sources at its supply chain partners. The new models will join the existing iPad 2 to demonstrate Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s complete iPad series targeting the entry-level, mid-range and high-end market segments, the sources claimed.</blockquote></p>
<p>These supply chain partner sources must have had their heads buried in the sand since December 2008, when <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/12/16Apple-Announces-Its-Last-Year-at-Macworld.html">Apple announced it will be pulling out after MacWorld 2009</a>. But maybe they know something. Maybe Apple is returning.</p>

<blockquote><p>I checked with a number of my sources today and an iPad 3 is not planned for release at Macworld. In case you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re wondering, an iPad 3 won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be released at CES either.</blockquote></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly the sources at DigiTimes know crap. Apple isn't releasing the next iPad, or anything, at iWorld. The only ones that know for sure work at Apple, but if I were to guess it'd be a press-only event in Cupertino in March.</p>
