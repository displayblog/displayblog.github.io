<p><a href="http://www.phonearena.com/htmls/LG-VX9100-phone-p_2628.html">Phone Arena</a>: The LG Electronics VX9100 enV2 replaces the VX9900 enV mobile phone. Compared to the enV, the VX9100 is slightly thinner and eliminates the bulge from the camera on the back. The dialpad on the front of the VX9100 has bigger buttons compared to the enV.</p>

<p>There is a small, tiny 1.45" LCD display with a pixel format of just 160 x 64 on the front and a much larger 2.4" LCD with a pixel format of 320 x 240 once you open it up. Image capture is at 2MP with video limited to 320 x 240. The QWERTY keyboard allows for easy texting. <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2704,2286270,00.asp">PC Magazine</a> has some good things to say about the QWERTY keyboard (except for the space bar):</p>
<blockquote><p>Flip open the enV2 to find the full keyboard and larger, higher-res 2.4-inch, 320-by-240-pixel screen inside. The QWERTY keys, like those of the original enV, are big, well separated, and a pleasure to use. There's one small flaw: the Space key is tiny, and it's shunted over to the right, rather than where you expect a traditional space bar to be. The phone's menu system is relatively simple, and a programmable shortcut key on the upper left can be set for quick access to e-mail. With its full, comfortable keyboard, the enV2 is designed for text, IM, and e-mail.</blockquote></p>
