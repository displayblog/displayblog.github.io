<p>Sharp is a tightly integrated company based in Japan. When you see a Sharp-branded LCD TV, you can automatically assume the LCD panel inside was made by Sharp as well, in addition to many other internal components. Not any more. Sharp announced that it will procure about 200,000 TV panels from Taiwan by summer 2006. Taiwan's LCD production technology and quality has increased at a rapid pace and rivals those from Korea and Taiwan. But there is something going on here. Sharp wants to have its brand image, make consumers pay more for that brand and wants to eat the cake too! I will assume Sharp will not let consumers know whether the LCD panel inside was made by a Taiwanese LCD manufacturer or by Sharp. AUO has been providing Sharp with 37" and will eventually supply 42" LCD TV panels.<br />
