<p>Philip Elmer-DeWitt, <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2013/04/09/apple-teen-survey-iphone/">Fortune</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The results of <a href="http://www.piperjaffray.com/private/pdf/Taking_Stock_Teach-in_Spring_2013_MV_2.pdf">Piper Jaffray's 25th bi-annual teen survey</a> came in Tuesday afternoon. Once again, it showed Apple to be the most desired brand among American teenagers who care about things like smartphones and tablets, although Google's Android did make some gains.</blockquote></p>
