<blockquote><p>We've known about the so-called HTC Pyramid for months, long before the Vodafone leak this morning. Now the long-rumored Android phone is official and coming to T-Mobile under the moniker HTC Sensation 4G. As expected, it matches many of the EVO 3D's specs, including a 4.3-inch (540 x 960) Super LCD screen, dual-core 1.2GHz Snapdragon processor, and Android Gingerbread (2.3) with Sense 3.0. But it one ups the 3D handset by bumping the rear lens' resolution to 8 megapixels, throwing in a second LED flash, and speeding up the video frame rate to 30fps at max 1080p resolution.</blockquote></p>
<p>Quarter Full HD or qFHD should be the term for 960x540. Instead it's qHD for some reason. Such is the almost non-sensical nature of display jargon. The 4.3-inch packing 960x540 pixels lead to a resolution of 256 ppi. Of course the comparison to the class-leading 3.5-inch Retina Display on the iPhone 4 must be made. With a pixel format of 960x640 on a relatively small display, but perfect in my opinion, the iPhone 4's IPS LCD has a 326 ppi resolution. The 326-ppi Retina Display is only a Retina Display when held at about 12 inches from your eyes, so you can get the same effect with the HTC Sensation 4G by holding it farther.</p>
<p>1080p HD content is displayed at 30fps. That sounds good and all, but that glorious 1920x1080 HD content is going look more like 960x540. Just a guess. What I'd like to see in the very near future is a pixel format of 1280x720 on the displays. That way we can capture 720p video and display it without monkeying around with scaling, resulting in some very good HD video quality.</p>
