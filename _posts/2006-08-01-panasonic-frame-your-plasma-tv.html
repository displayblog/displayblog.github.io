<p>Panasonic has an on-line site that allows users to pick out a plasma TV (TH-EBP42F9 and TH-EBP50F9) then select a frame for the TV in these colors/trims:</p>
<p>Executive Walnut<br />
Burnished Pewter<br />
Cottage White<br />
Classic Black<br />
Classic Gold Leaf<br />
Antique Gold<br />
Baroque Gold<br />
Bombay Mahogany</p>
<p>The frames are $400-$450 in addition to the $2500 for the 42" 1024 x 768 (XGA and "HD-Ready"). The 42" plasma can display up to 29 billion colors, according to Panasonic. It also has a 10,000:1 contrast ratio. The 29 billion colors are quite a bit more than what the human visual system can detect, but I guess it's a good thing overall, as long as it doesn't cost more than the normal units that can display millions. TH-EB42F9 will cost $3500 and is a real HD unit with 1366 x 768 resolution. Of course 720p HD content will need to be scaled, losing a bit of sharpness in the process. The 50" unit also has a 29 billion color capability and a 10,000:1 contrast ratio.</p>

<p>I am assuming you would want to put these up on a wall. The difficulty is when the wife wants to change the colors of the living room or the family room, you'll need to change the frame. At least you have an option with these two Panasonic plasma TVs. But maybe not having the option is a better option...</p>
