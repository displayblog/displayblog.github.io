<p>LG's KF755 is a slider, and a pretty nice-looking slider at that. The haptic touch on the 2.4" TFT LCD should enhance the touch experience as you get visual and physical feedback in the form of vibrations, thanks to tiny little motors. The 320 x 240 (landscape) pixel format has become fairly standard on a LCD of this size but it can auto-rotate to 240 x 320 thanks to an accelerometer. The camera has a very high pixel count at 5MP, but I am guessing the functionality of it to be quite a bit less than the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/06/10/sony-ericsson-c905-81mp-mobile-phone/">newly introduced Sony Ericsson C905</a>. I must mention that the KF755 lacks 3G capability. In light of everyone going 3G, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/06/09/iphone-3g-70-countries-july-11/">including the iconic iPhone with the new iPhone 3G</a>, it would seem an oversight by LG to have left it out.</p>
