<blockquote><p>Remember the Galaxy Player (or Galaxy S WiFi) we saw back at MWC? Sure you do, it basically strips out the 3G and calling functionality of a Galaxy S phone and leaves you with a Android 2.2 media player or shrunken tablet. Well, it looks like both the 4-inch Galaxy Player 4 and the 5-inch Galaxy Player 5 will be headed to the US this spring.</blockquote></p>
<p>Unfortunately I do remember. I got excited over the possibility of a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/10/21/samsung-galaxy-player-50-an-android-ipod-touch-3g/">Samsung Galaxy Player <em>with</em> 3G</a> but without voice calling, making it a smaller Galaxy Tab. Well, these two ain't it; they're just iPod touch competitors that don't really have a chance.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Player 4 sports a 4-inch Super Clear LCD. And the larger one packs a regular 5-inch LCD not worthy to even have a name. Both are probably limited to 800x480 pixels. If only there was an iPod touch with 3G or <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/02/09/wait-for-the-next-iphone-iphone-4s/">an iPhone without voice calling</a>.</p>
