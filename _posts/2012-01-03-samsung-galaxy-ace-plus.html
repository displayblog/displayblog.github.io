<blockquote><p>Today Samsung has announced the <del>iPhone 3G</del> Galaxy Ace Plus. The phone looks exactly like the iPhone 3G, and clearly illustrates Samsung&acirc;&euro;&trade;s game plan moving forward. Samsung&acirc;&euro;&trade;s product plan for 2012? Become an official Apple counterfeiter, and care not one iota about doing it.</blockquote></p>
