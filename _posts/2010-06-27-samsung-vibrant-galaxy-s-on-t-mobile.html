<p>Yet another Galaxy S variant. <a href="http://galaxy-s.t-mobile.com/">T-Mobile</a> is getting in on Samsung's Galaxy S action with its version the Vibrant. Available July 21st for US$199.99 with a qualifying voice and data plan with a new two-year agreement, the Vibrant is Samsung's Galaxy S sporting a 4-inch Super AMOLED display, 1GHz Hummingbird CPU, 5 megapixel autofocus camera with LED flash, 720p video capture, running Android 2.1. For those of you not able to wait until the 21st you can start pre-ordering the Vibrant at Radio Shack locations starting July 1st for just $50. As a bonus you get The Sims 3 Collector's Edition and Avatar pre-installed on a 2GB microSD. Yowzer. If you're on Verizon don't worry, the Fascinate version of Samsung's Super AMOLED-toting Galaxy S is available (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/27/samsung-fascinate-galaxy-s-on-verizon/">Samsung "Fascinate" Galaxy S on Verizon</a></em> for more info). Oh, and Captivate on AT&amp;T (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/24/unlocked-samsung-galaxy-s-us900-on-amazon/">Unlocked Samsung Galaxy S: US$900 on Amazon</a></em>).</p>
