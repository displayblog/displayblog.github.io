<p><strong>80% <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?s=led+backlight">LED Backlight</a></strong> AU Optronics (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?s=auo">AUO</a>), Taiwan's largest LCD manufacturer, is very optimistic about LED backlights for notebook PCs. The company expects 80% of its LCD panels geared for notebook PC applications to feature LED backlights. That's a big increase from 60% in Q1'09. The picture you see above is a profile shot of Dell's <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?s=adamo">Adamo</a> 13 that makes use of a 13.4" TFT LCD with a LED backlight sporting a 16:9 aspect ratio and 1366 x 768 pixels.</p>
<p><strong>CULV Growth</strong> The growth is due in part to growing demand for CULV (consumer ultra-low voltage) notebook models according to AUO. The company claims to have a 20% market share of the global CULV notebook LCD panel market in Q1'09. AUO was the first company to begin developing CULV LCD panels.</p>
<p><strong>"<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?s=led+tv">LED TV</a>"</strong> LCD TVs will slowly transition to LED backlights too. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?s=samsung">Samsung</a> is aggressively promoting its "LED TVs" which are LCD TVs with LED backlights that are positioned on the edges to make them ultra-thin. AUO expects 5% of its total LCD TV panel shipments to feature LED backlights by the end of 2009. That number will double by the end of 2010.</p>
<p>The transition from CCFL to LED as a backlight lightsource is going on strong. The benefits include more ruggedness, thinner LCDs, lower power consumption and greener products thanks to LED not having to make use of mercury, a poisonous substance.</p>
