<p><strong>Pale</strong> LG and Samsung each announced, on May 17, 2009, that the company has sold 20 million touchscreen phones in about two years. LG and Samsung has developed some very cool smartphones in the last couple of years. Samsung will be unleashing its <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/04/27/samsung-i7500-touch-oled-android-smartphone/">3.2" OLED touch Android I7500 smartphone</a> soon while LG has been quietly bombarding the world with a ton of touch smartphone models. But these numbers pale against the leaders: Nokia, RIM and Apple.</p>
<p><strong>Leaders</strong> Take Apple for instance. Apple's numbers are easy to analyze since the company has a single touch smartphone, the iPhone. Apple sold 11.4 million iPhones in the fourth quarter of 2008 (Source: <a href="http://www.ipodobserver.com/ipo/article/apple_doubles_year-over-year_smartphone_global_market_share_in_q4/">The iPod Observer</a>). That's just one phone and for one quarter. According to Gartner, in the fourth quarter of 2008, Nokia was on top followed by RIM with a 19.5% market share and Apple with 10.7% (Source: <a href="http://www.mobileburn.com/news.jsp?Id=6563">Mobile Burn</a>). Sources indicate that <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/05/13/phil-schiller-to-keynote-wwdc-2009/">Apple will be launching an enhanced iPhone in June during the WWDC</a> or at a small press conference in Cupertino soon after. RIM will be announcing its Storm 2 soon and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/05/18/palm-pre-first-week-of-june-launch/">Palm's Pre will launch in the first week of June</a>. Nokia will also be launching its N97 very soon.</p>
<p><strong>Popular</strong> Overall smartphones are quite popular: According to NPD 23% of all mobile phones sold in the US were smartphones in the fourth quarter (Source: <a href="http://topnews.us/content/24068-global-market-researchers-smartphone-sales-are-surging">Top News</a>). Smartphones generally have larger screens (LCDs and OLEDs) and should bode well for LCD manufacturers playing in this space. iSuppli expects smartphones to grow 11% year over year to 192 million units in 2009 (Source: <a href="http://cultofmac.com/optimistic-forecast-smartphones-sales-grow-11-percent-in-2009/9211">Cult of Mac</a>).</p>
