<p>Joshua Topolsky at <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/12/02/55-people-think-the-ipad-is-more-valuable-than-the-galaxy-tab/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to the report, an "overwhelming majority" of consumers prefer Apple's tablet over its nearest Android competitor -- a whopping 85 percent of those queried felt the iPad had a higher perceived value than the Tab.</blockquote></p>
<p>The total number of people in Gene Munster's survey was 65. Hardly a survey. Topolsky's recommendation:</p>
<blockquote><p>Next time you see the names Gene and Munster in the same sentence, don't just take the news with a grain of salt -- use the whole shaker.</blockquote></p>
