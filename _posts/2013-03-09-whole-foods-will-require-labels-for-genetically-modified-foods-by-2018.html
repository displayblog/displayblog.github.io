<p>Andrew Webster, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/9/4083934/whole-foods-genetically-modified-food-labels">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Grocery chain Whole Foods has announced that in five years time it will require labels for all products containing genetically modified organisms (GMO), a first among major American retailers.</blockquote></p>
<p>Not soon enough. Seven Whole Foods locations in the UK already have this requirement. Kudos to the UK.</p>
