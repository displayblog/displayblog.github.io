<blockquote><p>The company admitted on Friday that its older systems for storing uploaded content "did not always delete images from content delivery networks in a reasonable period of time even though they were immediately removed from the site," but said it's currently finishing up a newer system that makes the process much quicker. In the meantime, photos that users thought they "deleted" from the social network months or even years ago remain accessible via direct link.</blockquote></p>
<p>During the couple of years I was on Facebook I'm glad I didn't upload too many photos.</p>
