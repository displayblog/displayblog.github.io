<p><a href="http://blog.streamingmedia.com/2014/02/apple-building-cdn-software-video-delivery.html">Dan Rayburn, Streaming Media Blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple already controls the hardware, the OS (iOS/OS X) as well as the iTunes/App store platforms. Right now they control the entire customer experience, except for the way content is delivered to their devices. Since Apple does not own the last mile they won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be able to have complete control, but having their own CDN would give them more control and security than they have now.</blockquote></p>
<p>Sounds good to me.</p>
