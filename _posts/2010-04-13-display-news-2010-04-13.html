<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20100409PD218.html"><strong>BOE Expects Gen 8.5 Production in Third Quarter 2011</strong></a>: BOE Technology, a China-based LCD manufacturer, plans to commence LCD production at its Gen 8.5 plant in the third quarter of 2011 focusing on large LCD TV panels. By 2012, the company wants to become the fifth largest LCD supplier in the world according to Xuezheng Li, vice president of BOE. Li noted that China will become the largest market for LCD goods and local production will become increasingly important. BOE's Gen 6 LCD plant will begin volume production in the fourth quarter of 2010 with a maximum 90,000 substrate input capacity per month. The company's overall LCD production capacity is expected to increase 147.2% Y/Y in 2011 and another 120% Y/Y in 2013. BOE's entire capacity will be slated for China's domestic market with all China-based TV vendors as the company's customers. BOE expects a 20% share of China's LCD panel market in 2011 that will grow to 31% in 2012.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20100413PD214.html"><strong>Asustek Forecasts 4.5 to 5 Million LCD Monitor Shipments in 2010</strong></a>: Asustek Computer expects to ship 4.5 to 5 million LCD monitors in 2010. That is an increase of 29% to 43% Y/Y from 3.5 million units in 2009. Asustek was the top LCD monitor brand in Taiwan with 400,000 units sold and 25% unit market share in 2009. Acer and Chimei both shipped 250,000 units each in 2009. Asustek will be launching LED-backlit LCD monitors in 2010 with sizes ranging from 15.6 inches to 27 inches. LED-backlit LCD monitors will account for 10 to 15% of the company's total shipments for 2010. Taiwan's overall LCD monitor market is forecasted to grow 5 to 10% Y/Y in terms of unit shipments in 2010. AOC, a TPV Technology brand a competitor to Asustek, plans to launch a new product series in the months of April and May after having returned to the Taiwan LCD monitor market in the third quarter of 2009. Worldwide LCD monitor shipments are expected to range between 170 and 180 million units in 2010, a slight increase from 167 million unit shipments in 2009.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20100413PD213.html">Major LCD Monitor Brands Cut Prices in China</a></strong>: Due to less-than-expected sales numbers in China major LCD monitor brands are cutting prices. Samsung and AOC have reduced 19-inch LCD monitor model prices by 11% to 12% to CNY799 to CNY899 (about US$117 to $132). In recent years demand for LCD monitors and other PC-related goods have been strong after China's Lunar New Year. Unfortunately this year sales has been underwhelming. Still, China is poised to become the largest LCD monitor market in the world in 2010 with an expected market of 50 million units, an increase from 45 million in 2009.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20100413PD216.html">Demand for Netbooks Declining in Taiwan</a></strong>: Recently netbook demand has been decreasing in Taiwan. In response retailers have had to reduce mainstream model prices to NT$9,500 to NT$11,000 (about US$300 to $350) to reduce high levels of inventory. More price cuts are expected in the near future. In the first quarter of 2010, netbook's share of the overall notebook PC market in Taiwan was just 20%, a major drop from a peak of 40% to 50%.</p>
