<p>On March 6, 2009 Chi Mei Optoelectronics (<a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250:utpr0mvi0e9&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=cmo&amp;sa=Search">CMO</a>) announced February 2009 results that showed its revenue increase 18.2% M/M to NT$13.3 billion but on a Y/Y basis was a drop of 56.3%. CMO shipped about 4.2M large-sized LCD panels that represent a growth of 23.2% M/M but a decline of 18.2% Y/Y. The company's small/medium LCD shipments increased 29.4% M/M and 1.8% Y/Y to 7.26M units in February.</p>
<p>Although M/M figures are positive for CMO the Y/Y performance is still quite bad. This also means that LCD manufacturers might be finally recuperating. Small/medium shipments grew both on a M/M and Y/Y basis showing that ultra-portable devices continue to show strong demand.</p>
