<blockquote><p>Level 3, who recently signed a deal to become the primary provider for streaming Netflix content, was pressured by Comcast to pay a "recurring fee" "to transmit Internet online movies and other content to Comcast's customers who request such content." After a few days of negotiating, Level 3 paid the fee, ensuring uninterrupted service for Netflix subscribers.</blockquote></p>
<p>What's the big deal? Companies like Comcast that own a lot of Internet infrastructure can levy extra fees depending on the type of content that is being sent through their pipes. That's why net neutrality is important.</p>
<p>There's another important consideration: didn't Comcast and other similar companies receive massive amounts of government assistance in the form of tax breaks? In other words, citizens like you funded the connecting pipes that Comcast operates. I am glad I'm not a Comcast customer anymore.</p>
