<p>[ <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/10/29/technology-device-ownership-2015/">Pew Research Center</a> ] Monica Anderson:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, 68% of U.S. adults have a smartphone, up from 35% in 2011, and tablet computer ownership has edged up to 45% among adults, according to newly released survey data from the Pew Research Center.&nbsp;Smartphone ownership is nearing the saturation point with some groups: 86% of those ages 18-29 have a smartphone, as do 83% of those ages 30-49 and 87% of those living in households earning $75,000 and up annually.</blockquote><br />
I was surprised to see "tablet computer" ownership did not fall. When I had an iPhone 4s I used my 9.7-inch iPad a lot, but when I started using the 5, 5s, and then the Note 4 I gave my iPad to one of my children. I used my iPad mini a bit, but I had little to no need of my iPads. The iPad mini is now being used by my oldest. Yes, I am&nbsp;still the owner of two&nbsp;"tablet computers" but I no longer use&nbsp;them. My guess is there are many "tablet computer" owners who no longer use them much.</p>
<p>Note: I was no longer surprised after finding out&nbsp;the sample size was only 1907 adults. As of this writing the US Census Bureau estimates the population to be 322 million. That's a <em>lot</em> of extrapolating.</p>
