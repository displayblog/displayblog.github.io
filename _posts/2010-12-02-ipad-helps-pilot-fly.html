<blockquote><p>Pilots have been enthusiastic about the iPad and its ability to display radar and satellite weather maps in rich color, whether in the boardroom or on the ramp. The device can download and store charts, approach plates, taxi diagrams and checklists&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;or entertain passengers with an in-flight movie.</blockquote></p>
<p>A big, beautiful GPS system. I wouldn't be surprised if we see some iPad-integrated systems on cars soon. Wouldn't it be great if you could take all those buttons and morphed them into something simple and elegant on the iPad?</p>
