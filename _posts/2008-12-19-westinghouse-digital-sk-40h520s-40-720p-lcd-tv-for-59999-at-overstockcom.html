<p><a href="http://www.westinghousedigital.com/details.aspx?itemnum=172">Westinghouse Digital</a>: The SK-40H520S from Westinghouse Digital is not the sexiest TV I have seen in recent months. But nor is it the ugliest. It actually has a very decent design that is simple and black. The 40" LCD features a 1366x768 pixel format so that means 720p HD content. Don't worry about the lower pixel count as most folks can't tell the difference when watching 1080p or 720p HD content at the recommended distances.</p>
<p>The response time of 8ms is on the slow side. Couple that with a 60Hz frequency and you might bump into a bit of motion blur when watching sports or other video content that has a lot of stuff moving fast. However, viewing angles are as good as LCD TVs get at 178/178, though I would still recommend getting the seat right in the middle. The 2000:1 contrast ratio is very good but there are only two HDMI connections. If you need more, you need a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001II0HJC?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=displ0f-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001II0HJC">HDMI splitter</a>, which can cost a bit of money. Surely you do not need more than a satellite TV connection and a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FRTP94?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=displ0f-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001FRTP94">PlayStation 3</a> (which includes a Blu-ray player)? At least that's what Westinghouse Digital was thinking. But they were right to cut cut cut costs and here we have a <a href="http://www.overstock.com/Electronics/Westinghouse-SK-40H520S-40-inch-LCD-HDTV/3586800/product.html?cid=54555&amp;fp=F&amp;siteID=UnlJPFdznf8-Z.NG6ILDJNCIbuEWU6LRnQ">40" 720p LCD TV for just $599.99 at Overstock.com</a>. Quite a bargain.</p>
