<p>David Pierce, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/5/6107389/the-new-moto-g-motorolas-cheap-smartphone-gets-even-bigger-and-better">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>People wanted a bigger screen, so the new Moto G has a 5-inch, 720p AMOLED display. They wanted better speakers, so the G (like the new Moto X) has two grilles on its front face, blasting sound toward you instead of away from you. One particularly consistent request was for an SD card slot, which is apparently a popular way to share files and information between phones, particularly in developing markets. So the new Moto G has an SD card slot. It has two SIM card slots.</blockquote></p>
<p>The price for the new 2014 Motorola Moto G unlocked is an incredible US$180, less one penny.</p>
