<blockquote><p>So Apple, I think you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve got a bit confused. Don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t worry about sharing, we don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t need you for that. Your job is to take photos, organise them and make sure they don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t get lost. So let&acirc;&euro;&trade;s talk about how you can do that.</blockquote></p>
<p>Nixey shares some good ideas.</p>
