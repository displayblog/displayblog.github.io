<p><a href="https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/pressreleases/pr_111122b">NPD</a> reported January through October U.S. tablets sales, excluding iPads:</p>
<blockquote><p>PC manufacturers are dominant in the tablet space, as four of the top five tablet brands already have a strong U.S. consumer PC presence. Only two of the top five brands play in the smartphone market.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2011/11/fun_with_numbers">John Gruber</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>PC manufacturers are <em>not</em> dominant in the tablet space. Companies that provide a complete ecosystem &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; hardware, software, app stores, movies, TV shows, books and periodicals &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; are. PC manufacturers are utterly failing in the tablet market. The only thing you can learn from NPD&acirc;&euro;&trade;s report is that tablet market share numbers sure do look different when you don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t count any of the tablets that people are actually buying.</blockquote></p>
<p>NPD reports on U.S. point of sale (POS) data that covers roughly 65% of the market. Not included in NPD POS data are retailers such as Costco, Walmart, Sam's Club, etc. These retailers are massive and Walmart in particular sells a variety of tablets. Here is a list of tablets Walmart sells online, up to date as of yesterday: Velocity Micro Cruz T301, BlackBerry PlayBook, Maylong M-250, Filemate Identity, Motorola Xoom, Acer Iconia Tab/10.1, Acer Iconia W500, Toshiba Thrive, Kaser Net's Go, ASUS Eee Pad Transformer, Samsung Galaxy Tab, Arhos 70/100, Coby Kyros MID8024/1125, Sony Tablet S, E Fun Next5/6, ViewSonic ViewPad 10, Sungale Beam (7- and 10-inch), iCan Tablet, Ematic eGlide, Vizio VTAB1008, and Lepan TC970. Costco sells the Samsung Galaxy Tab/7.0 Plus, Toshiba Thrive, Acer Iconia A500, and Vizio VTAB1008.</p>
<p>Barnes and Noble doesn't release tablet sales figures. And Kindle Fire tablet sales data will most likely not be available from Amazon either based on how secretive the company has been with E Ink-based Kindle sales. </p>
<p>In the near future tablet sales will increasingly come from companies like Amazon&mdash;companies that do not share tablet sales information&mdash;and maintaining relevancy for its U.S. tablet POS data will be quite a challenge for NPD going forward.</p>
