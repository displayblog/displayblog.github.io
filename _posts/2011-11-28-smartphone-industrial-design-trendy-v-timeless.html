<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/28/ctech-us-htc-idCATRE7AN00S20111128">Jonathan Standing and Clare Jim, Reuters</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Its industrial design hasn't changed for almost two years. Unless it launches a really different phone, it's hard to sell the product at a premium price," said Roxy Wong, analyst at Mirae Asset Management in Hong Kong.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/11/28/dumb-analyst">John Gruber</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The problem with HTC is not that the industrial design of their phones isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t &acirc;&euro;&oelig;new&acirc;&euro;¬ù enough. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s that their phones aren&acirc;&euro;&trade;t good enough. What Apple shows is that if a phone is actually great, it will sell for years.</blockquote></p>
<p>And by great Gruber means the industrial design of the iPhone 3G/3GS and the iPhone 4/4S is timeless, not trendy, and the complete user experience from hardware and operating system to apps and multimedia has been thought through with care and brilliantly executed with excruciating detail.</p>
