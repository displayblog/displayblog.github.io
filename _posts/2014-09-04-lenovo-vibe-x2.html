<p>Luke Edwards, <a href="http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/130744-lenovo-announces-vibe-x2-and-vibe-z2-with-64-bit-and-8-core-chips">Pocket-lint</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The handset also features a 5-inch Full HD display, 32GB storage and that tri-layered design meaning multiple colour options. There's a 13-megapixel camera on the rear with auto-focus and a 5-megapixel front facing selfie camera that uses a wide angle lens.</blockquote></p>
<p>I like the blocky design of the Vibe X2. The 5-inch IPS LCD with 1920x1080 pixels make the Vibe X2 <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/09/04/5-inch-and-larger-displays-with-1280x720-at-ifa-20145-inch-and-larger-displays-with-1280x720/">a mid-range smartphone</a>. Many smartphone brands are focusing on improving the selfie experience by adding more pixels and a wide angle lens to the front-facing camera; I expect the photo and video qualities of selfies on Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube to improve quite a bit in the near future.</p>
