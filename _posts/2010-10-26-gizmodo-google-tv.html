<p><a href="http://gizmodo.com/5672946/google-tv-review-its-kinda-the-future">Gizmodo</a>'s Jason Chen on Google TV:</p>
<blockquote><p>The overall Google TV experience is solid, but it's hard to justify the purchase of a $300 product now when you can get a $100 or $150 product from Apple or Roku that is pretty similar. But, because we're future-looking here, we're optimistic about Google TV's chances of surpassing the other boxes when apps come to the platform. Would we buy it? Yes, but not until next year, unless you're looking for a replacement TV for your bedroom right now.</blockquote></p>
<p>When I watch TV, I want to relax. With a single, simple remote. The irony here is that I only watch TV on my MacBook <em>via</em> Hulu.</p>
