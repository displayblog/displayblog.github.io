<p><a href="http://www.numbersforstartups.com/blog/2011/10/31/running-the-entire-business-from-an-ipad/">Ryan Cumley, NumbersForStartups Blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>That said, I have found some genuine value to exchanging my usual laptop setup for the iPad.</p>
<p>Mostly it comes from the clarity / elimination of B.S. that forced minimalism can bring to you.</blockquote></p>
<p>Forcing non-essentials out brings in focus, on non-B.S. things. Cumley continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>I find myself markedly more deliberate in my actions, focused on completing the short list of productive things I have to do, and less prone to distraction.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2011/11/anti-distraction/">Shawn Blanc</a> comments on Cumley's last quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is something that I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve found true of working on my iPad as well. Last summer I touted iOS as the best piece of anti-distraction software I own.</blockquote></p>
<p>OS X Lion has been injected with a bit of iOS and I feel the result is a less distracting experience.</p>
