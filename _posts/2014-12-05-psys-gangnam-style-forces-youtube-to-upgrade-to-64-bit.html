<blockquote><p>We never thought a video would be watched in numbers greater than a 32-bit integer (=2,147,483,647 views), but that was before we met PSY. "Gangnam Style" has been viewed so many times we had to upgrade to a 64-bit integer (9,223,372,036,854,775,808)!</blockquote></p>
<p>Over two <em>billion</em> views. Wow.</p>
