<blockquote><p>Now Bridgelux thinks that after the two to three years needed to ramp its new tech up to production scale, the cost of producing LEDs will drop by three-fourths. Ten times greater electrical efficiency, ten times the lifespan of old bulbs and a much more affordable cost? Yup--soon every light you encounter may be an LED one.</blockquote></p>
<p>Today the price to replace your recently replaced CFL bulb with a LED bulb is about $40. Knock off 75%, or $30, and you get $10, in three years. No revolution, but definite progress. By that time though I'm guessing we'll be looking at replacing our LED bulbs with OLED sheets.</p>
