<p><a href="http://www.tmdisplay.com/tm_dsp/press/2011/11-04-26_e.html">TMD</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Toshiba Mobile Display Co., Ltd. has developed a 7.0-inch low-temperature poly-silicon (LTPS) thin-film transistor (TFT) liquid crystal display (LCD) for vehicle-mounted and industrial uses that enables multi-touch input on the display screen without the need for additional installation of a touch panel as a demonstration of its new touch panel technology.</blockquote></p>
<p>Thickness is reduced by 57% to about 1 mm. Weight is also reduced by 10%. Apple invested a large sum of money in Toshiba to secure displays. Naturally I wonder if TMD's in-cell touch technology will be applied to a future iPad. The iPad 2 is already quite thin, but looking at this I don't think it unreasonable to expect a thinner and lighter iPad 3 is in the works.</p>
