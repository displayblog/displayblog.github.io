<p>The TA1 has a 14" touchscreen LCD with a pixel format of 1280 x 768 with a 15:9 aspect ratio. The 14" LCD is rotatable. HP's DV1000 14" wide NBPC had the same panel format but the industry is moving toward 14.1" wide with 1280 x 800 pixel format and a 16:10 aspect ratio. The main driving force of this trend is due to Dell's incorporation of 14.1" wide 1280 x 800 in its NBPCs.</p>
<p>Overall, tablet PCs whether in slab or convertible style is not capturing the dollars of PC users, primarily because most users opt to type rather than write. Although writing skills are more advanced in Asian countries, those in the US have poorer writing skills (in terms of calligraphy) making it extremely difficult for optical recognition systems to reach anywhere near 100% accuracy.</p>
<p>I'm actually a fan of convertible tablet PCs because of the versatility. When I am taking notes, I often myself needing to draw a diagram and it would be great if I could simply pull the stylus out and start drawing.</p>
