<p>Panasonic <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/10/panasonic-toughbook-19-scores-upgraded-internals-to-match-its-mi/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The 10.1-inch XGA touchscreen on the Toughbook 19 now features a TransflectivePlus display, which, in addition to an adjustable LED backlight, harnesses the rays of the sun by using an internal reflecting layer to illuminate the screen and can generate up to 6000 nit of transflective brightness equivalent under 200K lx environment. This exclusive technology comes standard with anti-reflective and anti-glare screen treatments plus a circular polarizing filter for an unparalleled outdoor viewing experience. The LED backlight can deliver as little as 1 nit, useful in dimly lit areas or for concealed nighttime use, which is critical to the safety of military and public sector users.</blockquote></p>
<p>I'm not sure what "6000 nit of transflective brightness equivalent under 200K lx environment" means but I'm guessing sunlight readability on the 10.1-inch 1024x768 TransflectivePlus LCD is quite good. The matte display coupled with anti-glare and anti-reflective coatings (or films) should be a treat for eyes that are sore from glare-ridden displays on most notebooks. Now, if only <em>all</em> displays on mobile devices like smartphones, tablets, and notebooks had these features. It's interesting to note that Panasonic's website isn't updated with the email press release about the improved Panasonic Toughbook 19.</p>
