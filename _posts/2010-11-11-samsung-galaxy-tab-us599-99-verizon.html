<p><a href="https://store.verizonwireless.com/store/offers/deals/filters/SamsungGalaxy#/zip%7C97701/page%7C200/products%7C1000:2204">Verizon</a> (Flash required) &rarr; <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/11/samsung-galaxy-tab-on-sale-now-at-verizon-for-599/">Engadget</a>: The Samsung Galaxy Tab is now available on Verizon for $599.99 with a new two-year contract. If you've been wanting a Galaxy Tab on the more reliable network in the US this is very good news. You get two data plans to choose from: $20 per month for 1GB or $80 for 10GB. But if you don't want to pay that much you can get it for just $399.99 at Sprint.</p>
