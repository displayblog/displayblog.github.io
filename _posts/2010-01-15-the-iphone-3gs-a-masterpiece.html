<p>TechCrunch's MG Siegler compares the Nexus One from Google to his love, Apple's iPhone:</p>
<blockquote><p>Android is like a very nice painting done entirely with broad strokes. The iPhone is more like a masterpiece in which every little detail has been meticulously defined. Just as people have different tastes in art, people will have different tastes when it comes to the iPhone versus the Nexus One. But that doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t change the fact that some pieces of artwork are considered to be masterpieces, while some are considered to be merely very good.</blockquote><br />
Quite an interesting analogy. Let me spell it out very clearly: the iPhone is a masterpiece. The Nexus One is merely very good. Read the rest of MG's article at, "<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/01/12/iphone-versus-nexus-one/">An iPhone Lover's Take On The Nexus One</a>".</p>
