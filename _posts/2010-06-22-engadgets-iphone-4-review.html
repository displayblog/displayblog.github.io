<p>Engadget's Joshua Topolsky in <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/22/iphone-4-review/"><em>iPhone 4 review</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We're not going to beat around the bush -- in our approximation, the iPhone 4 is the best smartphone on the market right now. The combination of gorgeous new hardware, that amazing display, upgraded cameras, and major improvements to the operating system make this an extremely formidable package. Yes, there are still pain points that we want to see Apple fix, and yes, there are some amazing alternatives to the iPhone 4 out there. But when it comes to the total package -- fit and finish in both software and hardware, performance, app selection, and all of the little details that make a device like this what it is -- we think it's the cream of the current crop.</blockquote><br />
Regarding the Retina Display:</p>
<blockquote><p>... but we can tell you this: to our eyes, there has never been a more detailed, or viewable screen on any mobile device.</p>
<p>Not only are the colors and blacks deep and rich, but you simple cannot see pixels on the screen. Okay, if you take some macro camera shots or get right up in there you can make them out, but in general use, the screen is free of jaggies of any type, unless you're looking at a last-gen app that hasn't had its artwork updated. Text rendering is incredibly clear and clean...</blockquote><br />
For now, the best smartphone with the best display. Sounds good to me. For more info about the Retina Display read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/09/retina-display/">Retina Display</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/07/iphone-4/">iPhone 4</a></em>.</p>
