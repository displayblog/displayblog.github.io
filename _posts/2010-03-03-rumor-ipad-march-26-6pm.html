<blockquote><p>We have heard whispers the Apple is planning on launching the iPad at retail stores on Friday, March 26th at 6 p.m. in similar fashion to the original iPhone launch.</blockquote><br />

<blockquote><p>[Apple store employees] will get the first glimpse of the hottest gadget in years, the iPad, on March 10. This will be around the time training begins for the device.</blockquote><br />
Oh, and if you camp out, rumor has it you might receive a special gift.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> Well, it turns out it'll be April 3rd, with pre-orders starting March 12.</p>
