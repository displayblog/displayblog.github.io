<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20101226PD203.html">DigiTimes</a> &rarr; <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/report-apple-hikes-first-quarter-iphone-shipments-to-21m-another-signal-for-verizon/74709">Cult of Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Verizon may be getting a late Christmas present, if a new report proves correct. Apple is planning to ship between 20 million and 21 million iPhones in the first quarter of 2011 &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; 5 to 6 million of those CDMA-based. (Another 14 million to 15 million of the Apple handsets will reportedly be GSM.)</blockquote></p>
<p>Taiwan-based component suppliers have informed DigiTimes that Apple's original shipment target has increased from 19 million to 20-21 million. Maybe Apple thinks the global economy is getting better? Or maybe Apple's next iPhone will run on LTE networks? I'd be more interested in an iPhone that works on Sprint's amazingly fast 4G.</p>
