<p>Katherine Noyes at <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/211944/apple_is_getting_desperate_in_the_mobile_arena.html">PCWorld</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I believe Apple's iPhone is rapidly becoming a niche device. Its restrictions are too numerous, its approach too condescending, and its choices too few to have the broad appeal it needs to succeed on a grander scale in the long run.</p>
<p>In short, Apple may always have its share of fans among consumers who don't mind living in its "walled garden," but there's no way it can compete in the market as a whole with the diverse, compelling and powerful platform that is Android.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Mac can be considered a niche device: its market share of the overall PC market is quite small. The iPhone may also end up having a small slice of the overall smartphone market. I don't see this as a problem.</p>
<p>A curated "walled garden" experience is exactly what I want so I can get things done, be connected, have fun, and not have to tinker with the device itself. I am thoroughly satisfied with my Mac experience, and aside from AT&T, I can say that about my iPhone, too. Satisfaction is what it's all about, isn't it?</p>
