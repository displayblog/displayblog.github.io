<blockquote><p>AU Optronics Corp. today announced its preliminary consolidated June 2011 revenue of NT$31,273 million, down by 6.9% month-over-month and 28.3% year-over-year. Due to customers' inventory adjustments, panel's order momentum was weaker than expected. In the second quarter of 2011, AUO's unaudited consolidated revenues totaled NT$98,050 million, up by 5.2% quarter-over-quarter and down by 23.7% year-over-year.</blockquote></p>
<p>AUO is the second largest LCD manufacturer in Taiwan and it is suffering due to weak demand and inventory in the supply chain.</p>
