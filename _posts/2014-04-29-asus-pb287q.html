<p><a href="http://www.asus.com/Monitors_Projectors/PB287Q/">ASUS</a>: The PB287Q is a 28-inch 3840x2160 4K Ultra HD (UHD) monitor with a response time of 1 ms grey-to-grey (GTG) and a refresh rate of 60Hz (you'll need a DisplayPort 1.2 connection). The PB287Q comes with three ports: 2x HDMI 1.4 and 1x DisplayPort 1.2. When connected <em>via</em> HDMI the refresh rate drops to 30Hz.</p>
<p>When 4K OLED monitors start to come out &mdash; have no idea when &mdash; response times in the milliseconds will be laughed at, but for now 1 ms GTG is quite fast and should be fun to use when playing games, watching action flicks and sports. Unlike the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/03/31/samsung-ud590/">Samsung UD590</a>, the ASUS PB287Q sports real 10-bit sub-pixels, which means the 4K monitor can display over 1 billion colors.</p>
<p>Viewing angles are not quite up to IPS standards with 170/160 (CR>10) and brightness is a bit lacking too with a maximum 300 cd/m2. 4K monitors are not cheap, but prices are and will continue to come down: the Samsung UD590 is US$700. The ASUS PB287Q starts from a bit higher at $799.</p>
