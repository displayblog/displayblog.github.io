<p><img class="size-full wp-image-3685 aligncenter" title="sony_vaio_p_light" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/sony_vaio_p_light.jpg" alt="sony_vaio_p_light" width="480" height="379" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.umpcportal.com/2009/01/new-sony-umpc-info-includes-specs-and-a-sub-1000-price">UMPC Portal</a>: The Sony VAIO P is the company's entrance into the netbook market. But with a twist: the VAIO P will sport an 8" TFT LCD that is ultra-wide and featuring a 1600x768 pixel format. That's more than a 2:1 aspect ratio. Sony has given us a bit more information about the VAIO P stating that, "A new 'Light' is coming!" You can take that two ways: light as in feather light or a new type of lighting technology. I will take it both ways.</p>
<p>I want to believe that Sony will use all the weight-saving technologies that it knows to bring this 8" netbook down to under 2lbs. I would expect a combination of high-tech materials such as aluminum, magnesium and carbon fiber to get the job done. Also, I expect Sony to use a RGB LED backlight to bring you a 100%+ NTSC color gamut and an ultra-high contrast ratio that result in a LCD that you have not seen before on a portable platform.</p>
