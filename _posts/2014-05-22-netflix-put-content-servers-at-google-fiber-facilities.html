<p><a href="http://googlefiberblog.blogspot.com/2014/05/minimizing-buffering.html">Jeffrey Burgan, Director of Network Engineering at Google Fiber</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have also worked with services like Netflix so that they can &acirc;&euro;&tilde;colocate&acirc;&euro;&trade; their equipment in our Fiber facilities. What does that mean for you? Usually, when you go to Netflix and click on the video that you want to watch, your request needs to travel to and from the closest Netflix data center, which might be a roundtrip of hundreds or thousands of miles. Instead, Netflix has placed their own servers within our facilities (in the same place where we keep our own video-on-demand content). Because the servers are closer to where you live, your content will get to you faster and should be a higher quality.</blockquote></p>
<p>Eagerly waiting for <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/02/19/google-fiber-coming-to-san-jose-california/">Google Fiber to come to San Jose</a>.</p>
