HP's ENVY 14 is a great-looking notebook PC sporting a 14.5-inch HD+ Radiance Infinity LED display. Great looking because it looks extremely similar to the unibody MacBooks. What HP means by HD+ is a pixel format of 1600x900, which is really good for nothing. It can't play 720p HD video without scaling up. It can't play 1080p HD video without scaling down. You can't put up dual-windows for productivity. The only thing great about it is that you can easily figure out that the aspect ratio is 16:9.&Acirc;&nbsp;Graphics is powered by ATI's Mobility Radeon HD 5650 with 1GB VRAM. The news is that the <a href="http://www.shopping.hp.com/webapp/shopping/computer_can_series.do;HHOJSID=J20jMnnZMGPppg7z5nGqrC1yTGVJ5fvFJkdXL2ClWLQb4GJydXhn%21552955352?storeName=computer_store&amp;category=notebooks&amp;a1=Category&amp;v1=ENVY&amp;series_name=ENVY14_series&amp;jumpid=in_R329_prodexp/hhoslp/psg/notebooks/ENVY/ENVY14_series">HP</a> ENVY 14 is now available for sale starting from US$1099.99.</p>
