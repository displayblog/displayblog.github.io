<p>Yes, the 32" LCD monitor can deal with dusty, damp and humid weather conditions. The monitor has IP56 accreditation, has a TV tuner and a PC input. The viewing angles are 176 degrees left to right and up and down. According to <a href="http://www.securitypark.co.uk/article.asp?articleid=25574&amp;CategoryID=1">SecurityPark</a>, Sanyo's monitor is being tested at supermarkets as both a marketing tool and a security tool. Here are some specs I found at <a href="http://www.securitypark.co.uk/article.asp?articleid=25574&amp;CategoryID=1">Flattelly.co.uk</a>:</p>
<p>-IP56 certified (outdoor use)<br />
-Protective acrylic cover for LCD<br />
-Heat disspation via heat sync<a href="http://www.directtvs.co.uk/Sanyo_CE32LM3WP-B_-_32_Inch_OUTDOOR_LCD_CE32LM3WP-B/version.asp"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.directtvs.co.uk/Sanyo_CE32LM3WP-B_-_32_Inch_OUTDOOR_LCD_CE32LM3WP-B/version.asp">DirectTVs.co.uk</a> says that this type of solution is ideal for pubs since there are new no-smoking laws. If you want to smoke and watch the telly, then Sanyo's CE32LM3WP-B, IP56 certified!, is <i>the</i> solution. I would think this would be very popular in smoke-heavy places such as Japan, South Korea, Italy, etc. More specs from this site:</p>
<p>-0 - 40 degrees celcius operating temperature<br />
-1366 x 768 resolution<br />
-500 cd/m2 brightness<br />
