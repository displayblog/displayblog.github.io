<p><a href="http://na.blackberry.com/eng/devices/blackberrystorm/">RIM</a>: The RIM BlackBerry Storm2 fixes a couple of big problems plagued the first Storm. One of the biggest problems was the virtual keyboard technology called SurePress.</p>
<p>With a single mechanical switch underneath the center of the LCD, typing on the original Storm was less than pleasant. Want to press shift and a letter at the same time? Good luck. Storm2 has an improved SurePress with not one but four piezo-electric switches, one on each corner of the LCD. Thanks to having four switches you are now free to press more than one virtual button at a time. Engadget's <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/11/12/blackberry-storm2-hands-on-and-impressions/">Chris Ziegler</a> took the Storm2 for a spin and came out less than impressed with the updated SurePress:</p>
<blockquote><p>We can't think of a single good reason why you'd <em>want</em> your touchscreen to be able to click like this... What's worse, the Storm2's implementation requires a surprising amount of effort to actuate... it gets old hearing the screen's loud 'thunk' each and every time you type a letter.</blockquote></p>
<p>I guess <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/09/11/stantum-resistive-multitouch/">RIM didn't call Stantum like I recommended</a> a couple of months ago. Stantum has a resistive multitouch technology where the screen physically indents a bit to give you that "I clicked it"-feeling. And because it is resistive you can use your finger or anything else for that matter. And yes, multitouch is a definite go and the resistive technology is very responsive a whole bunch of touch points.</p>
