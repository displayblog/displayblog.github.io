<p>[ <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/02/facebook-reactions-totally-redesigned-like-button/">Wired</a> ] Liz Stinson:</p>
<blockquote><p>Your news feed is about to get a lot more expressive. After months of user testing in a handful of countries, Facebook today is releasing &ldquo;Reactions&rdquo; to the rest of the world. The feature isn&rsquo;t so much a new tool as it is an extension of an existing one; by long-pressing&mdash;or, on a computer, hovering&mdash;over the &ldquo;like&rdquo; button, users can now access five additional animated emoji with which to express themselves. Each emotive icon is named for the reaction it&rsquo;s meant to convey.</blockquote><br />
