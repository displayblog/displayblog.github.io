<p>Samsung Electronics is enjoying record sales for LCD TVs in Vietnam. Vietnam represents 5% of Samsung's Southeast Asia region sales. Southeast Asia regional sales revenue hit $10 billion in 2006, growing from $8.7 billion in 2005. LCD TV sales in the region grew more than six fold to 250,000 in 2006. Samsung is planning to build a plant in Vietnam that will volume manufacture PC monitors and printers. Samsung already has a plant in Ho Chi Minh City that produces LCD TVs.</p>
