<p><a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2453905,00.asp">Sascha Segan, PCMag</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The screen, on the other hand, is truly beautiful. This is still a 5.1-inch, 432 ppi 1,920-by-1080 Super AMOLED display, very similar to the S4's screen. But Samsung put a custom image chip in here that dynamically adjusts the color gamut and contrast based on ambient light. It's a big step up from the standard automatic brightness control, and it makes the colors really pop under different lighting conditions.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://www.displaymate.com/Display_Technology_2014.htm#Ambient_Light">Raymond Soneira has been pushing this type of implementation to compensate for colors washing out due to ambient light</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But there are other more advanced methods to improve display performance in ambient light that we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll be seeing in 2014. One is to use a display with a slightly curved (concave) screen that reduces reflections as mentioned above. Another is by using an <a href="http://www.displaymate.com/AutoBrightness_Controls_2.htm">Ambient Light Sensor</a> to accurately adjust the screen brightness &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; most current implementations are <a href="http://www.displaymate.com/AutoBrightness_Controls_2.htm">close to useless</a> but they are getting better. The most advanced method is to also use the Ambient Light Sensor to accurately vary the display&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Color Gamut and Intensity Scale to compensate for the washed out images resulting from ambient light reflecting off the screen.</blockquote></p>
<p>According to Soneira quantum dots can offer a similar solution with LCDs. As far as I know Sony is the only company using quantum dots for smartphone LCDs (e.g.. the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/02/24/sony-xperia-z2/">Sony Xperia Z2</a>), and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2013/11/18/kindle-fire-hdx-7-with-quantum-dots/">Amazon for tablets</a>.</p>
