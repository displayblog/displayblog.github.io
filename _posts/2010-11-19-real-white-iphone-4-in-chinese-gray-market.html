<p><a href="http://www.gizchina.com/2010/11/19/genuine-white-iphone-4-grey-market-china/">GizChina</a> &rarr; <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/11/19/real-white-iphone-4s-float-into-the-chinese-grey-market/">CrunchGear</a>: These white iPhone 4s are real. How do I know? According to GizChina:</p>
<blockquote><p>The white iPhone 4 box here has a label warning it is only meant for internal company use and not for sale!</blockquote></p>
<p>Prices are steep: CNY 5500 (more than US$800) for the base model. The weird thing is: how come all of these white iPhone 4s are retail packaged with all the necessary markings if they were meant only for internal company use?</p>
