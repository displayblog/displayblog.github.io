<p>What's in a brand? I say, I lot! Vizio. That name just doesn't do it for me. But for some, the price might be very tempting. But before we get to the price, let's look at the specifications: 1024 x 768 resolution, 10,000:1 contrast ratio, a HDMI port, an ATSC tuner. All is good except for that resolution. What do these plasma folks think we are? Stupid? If a 720p HD video source is format at 16:9 the resulting resolution required to view that uncropped/unscaled is 1280 x 720. Clearly, 1024 x 768 isn't going to do it. So scratch the HD from the name. The price? Under $1000. Right now it's $1199.99, so Vizio will probably drop the price by $200. Anyhow, even $1000 is a lot to spend on a pseudo-HD plasma TV.</p>

<p>Maybe we should get some lawyers to sue these plasma folks that are mislabeling the units so customers think they are getting a HD set but really are not. I definitely wouldn't get it if I was in the market for a HD set. The minimum resolution you should consider is 1280 x 720; most have a resolution of 1366 x 768. I highly recommend sets that have 1920 x 1080 resolutions!</p>
