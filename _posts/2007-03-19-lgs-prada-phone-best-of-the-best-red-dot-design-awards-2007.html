<p><span align="left"> LG Electronics received awards in 29 categories including the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Best of the Best&acirc;&euro;¬ù award for its PRADA phone, at the red dot Design Awards 2007.&Acirc;&nbsp; The PRADA phone by LG (LG-KE850) is the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s first full touch screen interface mobile phone and was co-developed by LG Electronics and PRADA. Although Apple's iPhone was the first to be announced, LG's PRADA phone is the first to be shipped and available to customers. A technical point, but true nonetheless.</p>

<p>The red dot Design Award, along with the iF Design Award, are prestigious industrial design awards in Europe. The gala award ceremony will take place on June 25, 2007, at the Essen Aalto Theatre in Essen, Germany. I wish I could go.</p>
