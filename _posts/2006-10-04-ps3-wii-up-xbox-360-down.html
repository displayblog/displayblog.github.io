<p>According to the Commercial Times, Siliconware Precision Industries (SPIL) is reporting an increase in chip orders for the PlayStation 3 (PS3) and Wii while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASE) are seeing decreased Xbox-360 related chip orders.</p>
<p>The PS3 supports 1080p displays, so for those of you out there that are making 1080p displays, expect there to be an increase in demand. 1080p displays have a resolution of 1920 x 1080 and are typically found in LCD monitors 23&acirc;&euro;&sup3; and larger and in LCD TVs starting from 37&acirc;&euro;&sup3;.</p>
<p>Wii is targeted toward a slightly budget-oriented gamer but, to my knowledge, does not support HD gaming. So what I would suggest is to bring out Wii-color-matched LCD TVs that are in the 20&acirc;&euro;&sup3; 4:3 range for $199 or so. Hey, Nintendo, why not have a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Made for Wii&acirc;&euro;¬ù program just like what Apple is doing for the iPod?</p>
