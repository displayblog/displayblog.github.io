<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/04/panasonic-lumix-gf2-preview/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Panasonic has ticked the major boxes of reducing bulk and including HD video (at 60fps, no less) while seemingly sacrificing little of what made the GF1 such a richly appealing camera in the first place.</blockquote></p>
<p>Panasonic has removed the physical dial and instead wants you to touch-control using the LCD. For something like the iPhone that sounds good. For a prosumer digital camera like the GF2, I'm not sure.</p>
