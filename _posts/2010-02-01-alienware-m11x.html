<p>If you look at the M11x you'd think Alienware was no longer a gaming brand. The M11x looks like a notebook designed with gamers in mind, but in its base configuration the M11x is simply not a serious gaming notebook. Here are the important specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>11.6-inch 1366 x 768 LED-backlit LCD</li>
<li>1.3GHz Pentium SU4100</li>
<li>2GB Dual Channel 800MHz DDR3</li>
<li>160GB SATA-II 5400RPM</li>
<li>NVIDIA GeForce GT 335M 1GB</li><br />
</ul><br />
No optical drive: you'll need an external drive to install your games. 1.3GHz Pentium? That's not going run the latest games. A 5400RPM hard drive wouldn't be fast enough. That puny 11.6-inch LCD will not provide an immersive gaming experience either. If you're not willing to lug around a bit more weight for a better gaming experience, then you're probably not as serious as you think about playing games. Sure, the GPU is on the more powerful side but that's about it. Price starts at $799. Of course, if you upgrade it a bit you can make the M11x a bit more powerful:</p>
<ul>
<li>1.3GHz Core 2 Duo SU7300: +$100</li>
<li>Windows 7 Ultimate, 64-bit: +$150</li>
<li>4GB Dual Channel 800MHz DDR3: +$50</li>
<li>500GB SATA-II 7200RPM: +$150</li>
<li>External DVD Writer: +$100</li><br />
</ul><br />
All of these options add up to a capable gaming notebook but will require a lot fatter price of almost $1200, which can get you a lot of other notebooks with a better gaming experience.
