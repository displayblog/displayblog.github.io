<p><a href="http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/lg-electronics-plasma-hdtvs-bring,336520.shtml">The Earth Times</a>, <a href="http://www.i4u.com/article13888.html">I4U News</a>: LG Electronics announced on April 2, 2008 that it is partnering with the Sonoma Valley Film Society as the "Official HDTV Sponsor of the 2008 Sonoma Valley Film Festival". The Festival will run from April 9 to 13. LG will showcase its PG60 Series plasma HDTVs and market it as part of a stylish home theater setting that include the company's BH200 Blu-ray player, and the LHT799 700W home theater system. LG's PG60 series plasma TVs are one of the first plasma TVs to attain THX Display Certification. The PG60 series is targeted to film enthusiasts and boasts superior front screen performance that include 1080p capability, an invisible speaker system and single layer design. The audio was custom tuned by Mark Levinson, a renowned audio expert.</p>
<p>LG's PG60 sure has a lot of big names associated with it: THX and Mark Levinson. The single layer design allows the plasma TV have a frameless look, which has its top glass layer span across the entire unit. If you look closely, there still exists a frame. Still the PG60 looks sexy. The PG60 along with some other very stylish TVs (LG60 LCD TV that is just 45mm deep) were announced during CES 2008.</p>
