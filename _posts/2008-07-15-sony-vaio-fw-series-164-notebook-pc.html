<p>The specifications for the Sony VGN-FW140E can be found <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/tag/sony-vaio-fw-series/">here</a>. But to note a few special features, the FW series is the first <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=16.4"">16.4"</a> notebook PC and sports a 16:9 aspect ratio. The pixel format is also unique with 1920 x 1080, something you'd find in <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a>s.</p>

<p>I can't get a good look at the design elements from this picture, but overall the design seem to be solid. Although smaller than typical 17" notebook PCs, the 16.4" FW series will still be rather large and would most likely be geared toward the desktop replacement market segment.</p>
