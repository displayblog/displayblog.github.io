<blockquote><p>The problem is, there's not much flexibility in the viewing angles. We had to adjust the screen angle very carefully before leaning back on the couch to watch Walter White lie and growl his way through season two. If the lid happened to be dipped too far back or if we watched from the side while a friend took the prime seat, the picture invariably looked darker.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Dell Inspiron 14z starts at US$600. For a better video viewing experience, as well as a better everything else experience, I'd recommend the $500 iPad 2. $607 with the Bluetooth keyboard and Smart Cover.</p>
