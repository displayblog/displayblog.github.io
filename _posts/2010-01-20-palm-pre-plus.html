<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/20/palm-pre-plus-and-pixi-plus-review/">Engadget's Joshua Topolsky reviewed the revamped Pre Plus from Palm</a>. Allow me to get straight to the points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Home button removed and replaced with a thin LED slit.</li>
<li>Clickier keys but still not clicky enough.</li>
<li>Stronger hinge for the sliding mechanism; now wants to slide shut a bit easier.</li>
<li>Keyboard loses orange number keys and has a monochromatic color scheme: harder to find the digits.</li>
<li>Precarious feeling the cheap plastic MicroUSB door cover will break.</li>
<li>Storage doubled to 16GB; RAM doubled too.</li>
<li>Less prevalent card kill warnings.</li>
<li>Audio is described as "shrilly, almost painful mid-rangey tones".</li>
<li>Coming in February:&Acirc;&nbsp;webOS v1.4 (Record and edit video, Flash plugin)</li>
<li>Verizon Navigator: Good, but not great.</li>
<li>Mobile Hotspot app: WiFi hotspot allowing up to five connections for $40 per month and a 5GB monthly limit. You go over the limit and you're hosed: $0.05/MB.</li><br />
</ul><br />
The Pre Plus still isn't faster. Palm promises speed and better battery life in the next update. Overall Joshua likes the webOS platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>... a truly elegant and revolutionary smartphone platform...</li>
<li>... a tremendous mobile operating system which allows you to handle lots of little tasks at once...</li>
<li>Android and the iPhone OS may have their killer features, but neither one of them can handle multitasking like the Pre...</li>
<li>This is a powerful and creative mobile OS with tons of potential...</li><br />
</ul><br />
Personally, Android is not ready for the general public. Android is for early adopters that like to tinker with their gadgets. I'm an early adopter but I'm not a tinkerer so Android is out for me. The iPhone 3GS is probably my ideal smartphone but AT&amp;T ruins it. The Palm Pre Plus coupled with Verizon is quite compelling. I'd rather have a bigger display and a lot more pixels instead of a slide-out keyboard. The reason might be different than others: I need to type Korean and a virtual keyboard makes it infinitely easier. A physical keyboard just like the one found on the Pre Plus that can change into different languages would be really cool and better than a virtual one. My AT&amp;T contract will expire right before <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/01/18/confirmed-apple-event-january-27-2010/">Apple announces something on the 27th</a>. In addition to the iPad, I hope Apple announces <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/11/30/qualcomm-in-talks-with-apple/">an updated iPhone that I can take to any carrier</a>.</p>
