<p><strong>Ion</strong> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250:8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID:11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=lenovo&amp;sa=Search">Lenovo</a>'s IdeaPad S12 is the first <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250:8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID:11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=netbook&amp;sa=Search">netbook</a> to make use of NVIDIA's Ion graphics processor. With Ion you get DirectX 10 graphics (the latest games) and 1080p HD playback. I don't know how NVIDIA did it but Ion has considerably more power yet uses a lot less of &Acirc;&nbsp;your CPU's power. There are a couple of videos and a bunch of <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/sff_ion.html">Ion information at NVIDIA's website</a>. The&Acirc;&nbsp;IdeaPad S12 makes use of the regular <a href="http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx?id=36331">Intel Atom N270 CPU</a> running at 1.6GHz.</p>
<p><strong>Mainstream</strong> One of the main concerns that I have with netbooks is the size of the LCD: almost always too small at around 10-inches. That also means the keyboards are also too small. The IdeaPad S12 makes use of a much more usable 12.1-inch LED-backlit LCD with a 1280 x 800 pixel format. The keyboard should be significantly more comfortable to type on compared to the smaller netbooks. Pricing starts at US$449.</p>
