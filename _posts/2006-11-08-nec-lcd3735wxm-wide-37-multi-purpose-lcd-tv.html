<p>NEC's LCD3735WXM is a 37" LCD TV with a 1366 x 768 resolution, a built-in ATSC HD tuner, and VGA, DVI with HDCP connectivity. The response time is a respectable 9ms (gray-to-gray, GTG) with a contrast ratio of 1600:1. The company is saying that the 9ms response time, part of its Rapid Response technology, allows virtually uninterrupted, undistorted viewing of high-speed, full-motion video. The display has detachable speakers that are mountable on the sides or the bottom. The base is also detachable and allows for easy mounting to ceilings or walls. The LCD3735WXM is available in early November for about $2299.99. The 9ms response time is not too shabby, but to claim that it will show virtually uninterrupted and undistorted viewing of high-speed, full-motion video might depend on what exactly they mean by uninterrupted and undistorted. No matter how small the response times are, due to the nature of a hold-type display that LCDs are, there will be some motion blur even with the best panels without using additional motion blur reduction technology. Motion blur, in my definition, distorts. So, unless NEC is using backlight blinking, black-frame insertion, 120Hz, OCB, ODC, etc. there is no way to get virtually undistorted high-speed full-motion video.</p>
