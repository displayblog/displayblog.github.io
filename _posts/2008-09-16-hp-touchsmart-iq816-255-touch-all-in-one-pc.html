<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=apple">Apple</a>'s <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=imac">iMac</a> is getting some serious competition from <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=hp">HP</a>. HP's <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=touchsmart">TouchSmart</a> IQ816 is the company's latest <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=all-in-one">all-in-one</a> PC and one huge differentiating factor has been its touch capability. Now add size as an additional advantage. The IQ816 is <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=25.5"">25.5"</a>, 1.5" more than the largest iMac (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=24"">24"</a>). The external design looks quite nice and it seems to be a bit thinner to boot. The pixel format of the 25.5" TFT LCD is <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1200">1920 x 1200</a> and is powered by <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=nvidia">NVIDIA</a>'s GeForce 9600M GS. The 9600M GS is probably going to whip the 8800 GS that's in the fastest 24" iMac. But the big daddy iMac hits back, hard, with its more powerful 3.06GHz Intel Core 2 Duo. The IQ816 counters with its <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=blu-ray">Blu-ray</a> drive, TV tuner, backlit keyboard and a price that undercuts the fastest 24" iMac by $100. The iMac is shaking but is still standing. But fight isn't over. Although HP has done a fantastic job of hiding the hideousness of Windows Vista with a very sexy UI, Apple hits back with an OS that is simply much MUCH better. Down goes the IQ816. Game over. For now.</p>
