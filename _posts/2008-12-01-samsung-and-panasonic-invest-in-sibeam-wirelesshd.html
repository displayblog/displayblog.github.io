<p>Cutting the wire to connect FPD TVs to HD content was inevitable. With multiple FPD TVs in a single household connecting them via wires is a painful process. There are many wireless products out there but not many are compatible with one another. Just as there is WiFi (with all the varieties but good compatibility) in the IT world it is about time the CE world puts forth a wireless standard. With deep pocketed backers like Samsung and Panasonic, SiBEAM's WirelessHD looks to be a strong contender to becoming the wireless standard for CE products.</p>
