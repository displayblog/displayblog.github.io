<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/16/panasonic-unveils-android-toughbook-slate-for-q4-sledgehammer-s/">Engadget</a>: The Panasonic Toughbook Android tablet sports a matte 10.1-inch 1024x768 multitouch LCD. The display sports high brightness and daylight viewability. Multitouch supports an active stylus to capture signatures at point-of-sale environments.</p>
<p>The market for rugged tablets is huge: think kids. I'm waiting for something like the Panasonic Toughbook that's rugged, but more kid-friendly like an iPad. Waterproof would be good, too, since kids tend to spill all sorts of stuff on expensive things.</p>
