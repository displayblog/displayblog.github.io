<p>The LG-U900 uses the SH-Mobile application processor. Mobile digital TV has large potential as Europe (Digital Video Broadcasting for Handhelds, DVB-H), South Korea (Digital Multimedia Broadcasting, DMB) and Japan (Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting-Terrestrial, ISDB-T) all have developed mobile TV solutions. The LG-U900 features a 2.2" wide LCD and allows three hours of continuous TV viewing. TV viewing is possible while making phone calls and transmitting data, such as emails. The LG-U900 is already available in Europe via Hutchison.</p>
