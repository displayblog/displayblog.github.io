<blockquote><p>Our esteemed friends at Giz found this to be a train wreck but I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t agree. This device is what it is: a small, fairly powerful tablet for Android lovers. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d love to play to my own bias and state that the iPad is unequivocally better but I can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t. This is for a different consumer and based on a different architecture. It is a good product, a little big, and an able device for media playback, e-book reading, and general email productivity.</blockquote></p>
<p>This is what I'm hearing: If you're a potential iPad customer the Samsung Galaxy Tab isn't for you. Want to get your grandparents a tablet? Scratch the Galaxy Tab off your list. This here 7-inch mini-tablet is for Android lovers.</p>
