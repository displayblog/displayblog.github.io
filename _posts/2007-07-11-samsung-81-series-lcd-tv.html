<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=samsung">Samsung</a>'s 81 Series <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a> features some innovative technologies. First up is the use of a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led">LED</a> backlight instead of the conventional CCFL backlight. A LED backlight allows the modulation of brightness to improve black levels (by dimming) and increasing the overall contrast ratio. This is a much more effective method compared to the brute force method of old where LCD panel suppliers simply increased the overall brightness to increase the contrast ratio. So, the dynamic contrast ratio is improved to 100,000:1 (the 71 Series has a 25,000:1 <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dynamic-contrast">dynamic contrast</a> ratio using the normal CCFL backlight).</p>

<p>It has 10-bit processing, which means 8-bit color, which means 16 million colors. The response time of 8ms isn't all that great, but I wonder if the 81 Series have the Auto Motion Plus feature of the 71 Series. The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=120hz">120Hz</a> frequency will greatly reduce motion blur and goes hand in hand with fast response times to really improve front screen performance. Oh, one last, but very important feature: <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1080p">1080p</a>, or <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=full-hd">Full HD</a>, or pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a>. The 81 Series come in <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=40"">40"</a>, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=46"">46"</a>, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=52"">52"</a> and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=57"">57"</a> sizes for $3000, $4000, $5000 and $7000. Ouch. I'll wait until prices are about half that.</p>
