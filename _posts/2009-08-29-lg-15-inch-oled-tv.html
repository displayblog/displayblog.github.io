<p>A flickr user by the name of LGEPR has put up some sexy pictures of LG's 15-inch OLED TV. If this is <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/01/14/ces-2009-lg-15-oled-tv-prototype/">the same 15-inch OLED TV panel that I saw back in CES 2009</a>, then the resolution should be 1366 x 768: 720p HD capable. The 15-inch OLED panel that I saw at CES was extremely thin at just 0.85mm (millimeter) thick. With what seems a completed chassis, LG's 15-inch OLED TV could be headed for shelves the world over by the end of this year. Price? I have no idea but I would guess it would be more expensive than <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=xel-1&amp;sa=Search">Sony's 11-inch XEL-1 OLED TV</a> at $US2499.99. Head on over to flickr for more pictures.</p>
