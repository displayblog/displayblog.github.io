<p>Adam Lashinsky <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/steve-jobs-believes-apple-will-ok-without-him/93945">Cult of Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jobs himself believes he has set Apple on a course to survive in his absence. He has created a culture that, while not particularly jolly, has internalized his ways. [...]</p>
<p>His mission: to turn the traits that people most closely associate with Jobs&acirc;&euro;&ldquo;the attention to detail, the secrecy, the constant feedback&acirc;&euro;&ldquo;into processes that can ensure Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s excellence far into the future.</blockquote></p>
<p>Steve Jobs is the essence of Apple. While I think Apple will not only survive, but continue to thrive, without having Jobs on campus day-to-day, a culture dissipates over time. And over time you need Steve Jobs to inject himself into Apple's culture to purify it.</p>
