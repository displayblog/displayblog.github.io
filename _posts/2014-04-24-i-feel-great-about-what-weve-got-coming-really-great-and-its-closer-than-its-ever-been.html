<p><a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/04/24/apples-cook-on-new-products-take-the-time-to-get-it-right/">WSJ</a>: That's Tim Cook, in an interview with Daisuke Wakabayashi. Here's more:</p>
<blockquote><p>You want to take the time to get it right. Our objective has never been to be first. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s to be the best. To do things really well, it takes time. You can see a lot of products that have been brought to market where the thinking isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t really deep and, as a consequence, these things don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t do very well. We don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t do very many things so we spend a lot of time on every detail and that part of Apple isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t changing. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the way we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve operated for years and it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the way we still operate. I feel great about what we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve got coming. Really great and it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s closer than it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s ever been.</blockquote></p>
<p>I don't want to be overly logical or cynical, but as time passes and as Apple works on new stuff, isn't it normal, natural, obvious that new stuff is closer than ever? It <em>feels</em> like Tim Cook revealed something exciting, but in reality he revealed nothing.</p>
<p>I do like Apple taking the time to get things right. I've seen too many companies rush too many crappy products to the market. People buy them because they are new and cheap but eventually they end up on Craigslist, eBay, or failing a quick sale there at the Salvation Army or in the trash. I'll patiently wait for what Apple has up its sleeve.</p>
<p>PS: Continue to take time to do things right Apple, but when you get it wrong hurry up and fix it. My iPhone and my iPad likes to reboot itself from time to time. Apple fixed the iPad by replacing it: fast, good. The iPad no longer self reboots; the Genius at the Apple Store told me it was a problem in the logic board. The iPhone? It doesn't self reboot enough for me to take it to the local Apple Store, but every reboot annoys a bit more each time and eventually I will be forced to visit the Genius Bar. Here's one big annoyance: &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Touch ID requires your password when iPhone restarts. Enter the password for ...&acirc;&euro;¬ù</p>
