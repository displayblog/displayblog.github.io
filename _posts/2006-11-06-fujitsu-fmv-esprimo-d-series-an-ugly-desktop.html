<p><a href="http://pr.fujitsu.com/jp/news/2006/11/6.html">Fujitsu</a>: I have not seen an ugly desktop such as Fujitsu's FMV Esprimo D-Series in a very long time. Not only is beige so old the case, monitor, keyboard and mouse designs are very old school and pretty darn ugly if you asked me. The desktop comes with a Core 2 Duo E6700 CPU, only 256MB of DDR2 SDRAM, a drop-in-the-bucket sized 40GB of HDD, and a sky-high price of about $1800. It's amazing what corporations are willing to pay for something so... crappy.</p>
<p>From the looks of the LCD monitor, I am guessing it will be a typical <strike>19"</strike> 17". Google translated something regarding a "security tip/chip". I am assuming of a biometric security device built into the ugly box. All is not lost: This box reminded me of about 10 years ago when these boxes were popular, where you would prop up a desktop unit to make it look cooler like the ones your friends had: a tower.</p>
