<p><a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook-Air-11-Inch-Model-A1370-Teardown/3745/1">iFixit</a> opened up the 11.6-inch MacBook Air. Apple has done a superb job of miniaturization with the 11.6: it is amazing how little there is. The microphone was moved from the display assembly down to the body, next to the headphone jack. I wonder why...</p>
<p>The 11.6-inch MacBook Air is the first MacBook to sport a 16:9 aspect ratio with a 1366x768 pixel format. All others are 16:10: 13.3-inch MacBook Air (1440x900), 13.3-inch MacBook & Pro (1280x800), 15.4-inch MacBook Pro (1440x900, optional 1680x1050), and 17-inch MacBook Pro (1920x1200). I hope 16:9 isn't a sign of things to come. I like the extra vertical pixels.</p>
