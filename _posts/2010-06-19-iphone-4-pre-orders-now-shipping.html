<p>There were 600,000 pre-orders for the iPhone 4 (read <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/15/apple-iphone-4-pre-orders-sold-out/"><em>Apple iPhone 4 Pre-Orders Sold Out</em></a>). And if you are one of the lucky ones that didn't get a cancellation notice (read <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/19/apple-att-randomly-canceling-iphone-4-pre-orders/"><em>Apple, AT&amp;T Randomly Canceling iPhone 4 Pre-Orders</em></a>), some of you should be getting your shiny black iPhone 4 a day early by June 23 by the looks of a shipment notification posted on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/20/iphone-4-pre-orders-now-shipping/">Engadget</a>. Aargh, how long must I wait for my white one!</p>
