<p><a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2131699/o2-starts-apple-iphone-4s-rental-scheme">Chris Martin, The Inquirer</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The service is called O2 Lease, which it claims is the UK's first smartphone leasing service. The system allows customers to rent specifically the Iphone 4S for a year without any upfront costs.</blockquote></p>
<p>The 16GB iPhone 4S with 750 minutes, unlimited text messages, 500MB data, and insurance costs &pound;55 per month; &pound;65 for the 32GB version. Not bad at all, and that's with zero upfront costs. For those who must have the latest and greatest iPhone every year a one year lease can save you the hassle of selling the older model. Make sure to cover it up nicely. If the auto industry is any indication you could be dinged for any scratches.</p>
