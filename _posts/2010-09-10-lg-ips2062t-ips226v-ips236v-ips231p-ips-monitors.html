<p>LG announced four new IPS LCD monitors: the 20-inch IPS2062T, the 21.5-inch IPS226V, the 23-inch IPS236V and the range-topping 23-inch IPS231P professional monitor. All four sport LED backlights, 6ms response times, a brightness of 250 cd/m2 and 178-degree viewing angles. The larger three feature a 1920x1080 pixel format while the 20-inch IPS2062T has a completely useless 1600x900. Only the IPS231P has height, tilt, swivel, pivot capabilities and built-in speakers. Weird looking neck though. Source: <a href="http://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&id=1283940705">FlatPanelsHD</a></p>
