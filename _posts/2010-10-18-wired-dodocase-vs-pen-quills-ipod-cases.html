<p>Charlie Sorrel at <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/10/ipad-case-smackdown-dodocase-vs-pen-quill/?intcid=postnav">Wired</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Which one do I prefer? Neither. I have settled on Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s own case, which is cheap (ish), slimline and protective. If these two faux-Moleskines could be described as Victorian chaperones, making sure that their charges remain virgin and untouched at the expense of being highly intrusive, the Apple case is more like a Durex Featherlite: it offers protection, but you hardly know it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s there.</blockquote></p>
<p><em>The Case</em> from Pen & Quill is significantly more quality than the Dodocase but also more bulk and weight.</p>
