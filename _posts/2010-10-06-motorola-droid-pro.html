<p>The Motorola Droid Pro is a global phone that has both CDMA and GSM baseband chips. The Android 2.2 smartphone sports a 3.1-inch display, a 5 megapixel autofocus camera with dual-LED flash, 3G mobile hotspot for up to five connections, and a QWERTY keyboard, the non-sliding kind. </p>
<p>What makes the Motorola Droid Pro weird is that it is a world phone as long as you're language is English. I'm no globetrotter but if I were in the market for a global phone I would want a phone that allows me to easily switch from English to another language. The Droid Pro will be available in the first week of November.</p>
