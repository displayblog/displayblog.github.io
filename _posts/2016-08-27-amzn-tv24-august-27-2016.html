<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>4K vs. 1080p</strong></p><br />
As promised, today I'll be sharing 4K vs. 1080p share on Amazon's front search result page. <a href="http://displayblog.com/2016/08/25/amzn-tv24/">Click for an introduction on my AMZN.TV24 report</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26833" src="http://displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/AMZNTV24_20160827_4Kvs1080p.jpg" alt="AMZN.TV24 2016.08.27 4K vs. 1080p" width="590" height="398" /></p>
<p>I started tracking information on Amazon on August 4, 2016. Unlike the previous two (<a href="http://displayblog.com/2016/08/25/amzn-tv24/">Brand Share</a>, <a href="http://displayblog.com/2016/08/26/amzn-tv24-august-26-2016/">Size Share</a>) where I limited the chart to just 12 data points, the 4K vs. 1080p chart will go all the way back. This way the trend becomes more clear.</p>
<p>For most of August 4K has had about 60% share, but more recently and in particular the 22nd and 23rd of the month 4K and 1080p had equal share. The last two days show 4K gaining popularity again. I expect going forward 4K will not only return to 60% share, but take over. But there are some questions.</p>
<p>Would consumers respond to <em>ridiculously </em>low 1080p TV prices or to really low&nbsp;4K prices? Ludicrous 1080p prices&nbsp;are sure to&nbsp;happen during Black Friday this year. Imagine a 55-inch 1080p LCD TV from a major brand going for US$299! I know I'd be tempted to get one, only if it's a good brand though. And limited quantities.&nbsp;Of course. I'm betting there will be&nbsp;a major pop in 1080p LCD TV popularity in November and December. I mentioned limited quantities, but incredibly low prices will also be for a limited time as major LCD manufacturers move away from low&nbsp;profit&nbsp;margin 1080p and toward higher&nbsp;profit&nbsp;margin 4K.</p>
<p>Is 4K really that good? Yes, if you're watching sports. No, if you're watching stuff other than sports. From time to time I go to our local Best Buy store to check out what's up. I go upstairs where the TVs are and go to the Magnolia rooms to look at the really good TVs. At first glance they look pretty good, but often I have to take&nbsp;a closer look. I think to myself: Am I watching a documentary about the makings of <em>The Avengers</em>? Or am I watching the actual movie? It's not clear.&nbsp;I'll be blunt: watching 4K movies on a 4K TV sucks, because it feels like I'm watching a documentary. I'd like my belief to be suspended and be immersed. The details are too real for my belief to be suspended and there's nothing to be immersed in. Maybe TV brands can include a feature that makes movies look more like movies by downgrading to 1080p?</p>
<p>[&nbsp;<em>Note: A DISPLAYBLOG reader Howard M. wrote in with a correction. The documentary effect, also known as the soap opera effect, on movies is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> caused by resolution (4K) but is the result of frame interpolation, which generates more frames than the film's 24 fps. There are other names for frame interpolation: motion interpolation, motion estimation motion compensation (MEMC), and probably a couple more. Most modern 4K TVs come with frame interpolation turned on:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>LG's TruMotion</em></li>
<li><em>Samsung's AutoMotion Plus</em></li>
<li><em>Sharp's AquoMotion</em></li>
<li><em>Sony's MotionFlow</em></li>
<li><em>VIZIO's Smooth Motion Effect, etc.</em></li><br />
</ul><br />
<em>Hat tip to Howard M.!&nbsp;</em>]</p>
<p>Next Monday I'll be looking at price trends. It'll be considerably more lengthy than the first three as I will be sharing some insights about:</p>
<ul>
<li>1080p average price trends by size</li>
<li>4K average price trends by size</li>
<li>4K price premiums by size</li><br />
</ul><br />
Have a great weekend!</p>
