<p>JP Morgan analyst <a href="http://www.9to5mac.com/70036/jp-morgan-wannabe-ipad-killers-slow-down-build-plans/">Mark Moskowitz</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The technical and form factor improvements of the iPad 2 stand to make it tougher for the first generation of competitive offerings to play catch-up, meaning actual shipments could fall well short of plan.</blockquote></p>
<p>According to Moskowitz tablet brands competing against the iPad are reducing build activity in recent months.</p>
<p>There must be something going on and I think it must be that Android is a difficult mobile OS to tame to make it work well with chips from NVIDIA, Qualcomm, and Texas Instruments. Even with the fastest mobile chips from these companies Android isn't quite as snappy as iOS on the iPads.</p>
