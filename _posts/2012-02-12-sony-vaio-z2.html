<p><a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/5530/sony-vaio-z2-everything-is-peripheral/6">Dustin Sklavos, AnandTech</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fantastic contrast, color accuracy, color gamut...the Sony VAIO Z2's 1080p screen is among the best screens we've ever tested and embarasses the competition. While other manufacturers continue to dump poor quality 768p screens in their portables, Sony shows everyone else how it's done. There's a measure of backlight bleed at the bottom, but uniformity is generally superior to other notebooks in the Z2's class.</blockquote></p>
<p>This is what I'm waiting for: IGZO-based IPS LCDs for notebooks. Make that a Retina, too, like a 13.3-inch <a href="/2011/12/14/2880x1800-macbook-pro/">2880x1800 MacBook Pro</a>.</p>
