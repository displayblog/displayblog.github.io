<p>For a while that was what AT&T believed. If you tried to order the iPhone online with a New York City zip code (or even nearby ones) you couldn't. Your city wasn't ready. But after a while something must have changed: New York City is now ready for the iPhone. This must surely be near the top of "The Stupidest Things Companies Did in 2009" list.
