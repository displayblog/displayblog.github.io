<p>The upcoming Version 3.50 update to Sony's PlayStation 3 (PS3) will add support for 3D Blu-ray playback. The date is September 21st and probably will be worldwide. </p>
<p>I was curious as to how many 3D Blu-ray titles there were. I didn't think there were going to be that many. So I went to Amazon and did a quick search of "3d blu-ray" and out came <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3D3d%2520blu-ray%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&tag=displ0f-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957">311 results</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=displ0f-20&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. That's quite a bit. Source: <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2010/09/16/ps3-firmware-update-3-50-coming-september-21-adds-3d-blu-ray-su/">Joystiq</a></p>
