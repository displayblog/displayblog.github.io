<p>Lenovo's chairman Liu Chaunzhi on Steve Jobs:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are lucky that Steve Jobs has such a bad temper and doesn't care about China.  My theory is that a manager needs to be the string on which he puts one pearl after another. But Jobs himself is a big pearl.</blockquote><br />
That's what he shared with the <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/604d1d54-87b9-11df-9f37-00144feabdc0.html">Financial Times</a>. Well, sorry to burst your bubble Mr. Chaunzhi, but Apple plans to open an Apple Store in Shanghai this Saturday. The Shanghai Apple Store will be located between the IFC Mall and the Oriental Pearl TV Tower. And by the end of 2011 the big-pearl bad-tempered Steve Jobs &amp; Co. expects to open 25 stores in China. I guess Lenovo's luck ran out.</p>
<p>PS: I don't get Chaunzhi's pearl analogy but this is an interesting coincidence: big-pearl Steve and an Apple Store next to the Pearl Tower.</p>
