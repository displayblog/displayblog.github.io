<p><strong>Nikon Lenses</strong> What you see above is the teaser that was shot with a <a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3Autpr0mvi0e9&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=canon+5d+mark+ii&amp;sa=Search">Canon 5D Mark II</a>. The folks at PATAHOUSE will be the first to use a DSLR to shoot a feature-length movie. The interesting thing is that the lenses were Nikon with the 50mm working overtime. Why? <a id="more"></a><a id="more-5144"></a></p>
<p><strong>Pandora's Box</strong> The Canon 5D Mark II is the first full-frame DSLR that can shoot 1080p video. You can get superb video quality because the entire line of Canon lenses can be used. But there are some limitations. You can't directly control aperture and exposure. The 5D Mark II communicates with the lens and becomes fully automatic in Live Mode.</p>
<p><strong>Aperture Control</strong> To overcome this challenge, the folks at PATAHOUSE used Nikon lenses with an adapter that they bought on eBay for $80. This way the 5D Mark II can't communicate with the lenses. And aperture can be controlled by you. Why do you want to control aperture?</p>
<p>If you want to control depth of field, then you need to control the aperture settings. With control over depth of field you can create sharp details on the subject while softening everything else.</p>
<p><strong>Exposure Control</strong> "For every shot, you want the lowest light sensitivity so you'll have the least amount of graininess and noise." On the 5D Mark II exposure is automatic. You have no control. But there is a thing called "exposure lock"--a button on the camera with the asterisk. How do you use it?</p>
<p>Point the camera at lighter and darker objects. Lock the exposure. Start recording. Adjust aperture as necessary.</p>
