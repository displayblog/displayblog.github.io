<blockquote><p>TFT-LCD panel maker Chimei Innolux (CMI) is making efforts to hike yield rates for its production of IPS (in-plane switching) panels to a level required for use in the iPad, and hopes to obtain certification from Apple and then begin shipments in May 2011, according to industry sources.</blockquote></p>
<p>It's interesting that CMI would start manufacturing 9.7-inch IPS TFT LCDs when it hasn't yet received certification from Apple.</p>
