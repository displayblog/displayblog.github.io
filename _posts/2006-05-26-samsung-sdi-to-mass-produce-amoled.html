<p>SDI will mass produce active-matrix OLED (AMOLED) in October 2006, 3 months ahead of schedule. In March 2006, SDI announced a US$450 million AMOLED plant in Cheonan, Korea. SDI is aiming the digital multimedia broadcast (DMB) enabled mobile phone market that began in South Korea and will produce roughly 20 million 2"-2.6" AMOLED displays per year. The AMOLED will use a LTPS base material, a first in the industry. Lee Woo-Jong, VP of SDI&#39;s Mobile Display Business claimed that the company would expand to the 40" TV market with AMOLED technology in two to three years. By 2008, production capacity will hit 100 million units claimed Lee.</p>
