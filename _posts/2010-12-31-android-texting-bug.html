<blockquote><p>[...] the one we definitely experience on the Gingerbread-powered Nexus S involves being routed to the wrong thread when you tap it either in the Notifications list or the master thread list in the Messaging application, so if you don't notice, you'll end up firing a message to the wrong person.</blockquote></p>
<p>Google needs to fix this texting bug (issue <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=9392">9392</a> on Google Code). Until then double, triple check who you're texting to.</p>
