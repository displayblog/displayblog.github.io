<p><a href="http://www.koreaherald.co.kr/SITE/data/html_dir/2006/09/06/200609060024.asp">The Korea Herald</a>: LG Electronics (LGE) stated on September 10, 2006 that it will begin producing LCD TVs at its new production plant in Wroclaw, Poland starting this month. The original launch date was planned for the first half of 2007 but LGE has moved it up to meet the demand for LCD TVs in Europe. LGE currently operates LCD and plasma display panel (PDP) TV production plants in Mlawa, Poland. LGE's annual production capacity will increase from 6 million units in 2006 to 11 million in 2010, with the help of the Wroclaw plant. In October 2005, LGE began operating its second Mlawa plant and has a current capacity of 4 million units, which will increase to 6 million by 2010. The Wroclaw plant's capacity is at 2 million annual units and will expand to 5 million by 2010. LGE has a lofty goal of capturing the number one position in Europe's PDP TV market in 2007.</p>
<p>The population of Western Europe is more then 300 million and competes against the US as the world's largest TV market. However, with many different cultures, languages and laws, TV brands have to multitask quite a bit more to leverage that large market. To get around stiff tariffs of imported electronic goods, many manufacturers have been forced to construct plants in the EU.</p>
