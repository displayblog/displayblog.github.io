<p><a href="http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/201210/12-152E/index.html">Sony</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In order to enhance the efficiency of Sony's manufacturing operations relating to its digital imaging business, the manufacture of interchangeable lenses and lens blocks currently being conducted at Sony EMCS Corp.'s Minokamo Site (located in Minokamo, Gifu Prefecture) will be absorbed by EMCS Corp.'s Kohda Site (located in Kohda, Aichi Prefecture). As Sony concentrates its mobile phone business on the area of smartphones, the operations currently being carried out at the Minokamo Site relating to mobile phones will be partially discontinued and partially transferred to Sony EMCS Corp.'s Kisarazu Site. As a result of this realignment, the Minokamo Site is scheduled to close at the end of March 2013.</blockquote></p>
<p>At least Sony lenses will still be manufactured in Japan. After selling my silver NEX-5, and realizing the iPhone 4/4S photos weren't cutting it, I recently purchased a used black NEX-5. The only thing I'd like to change is "Made in Thailand"; for me the experience of owning my NEX would have been enhanced with "Made in Japan".</p>
