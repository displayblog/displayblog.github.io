<p>Alienware's Sentia m3450 sports a 14.0" TFT LCD display with a 15:9 aspect ratio and 1280 x 768 resolution. Just so everyone is on the same page, there are two distinct 14.x" wide displays:</p>
<p>14.0", 1280 x 768, 15:9<br />
14.1", 1280 x 800, 16:10</p>
<p>HP came out swinging with its dv1000 about 1 1/2 years ago and had the 14.0" wide display. For some reason, Dell didn't want the same display and made LG.Philips LCD and Samsung, to name two display manufacturers, make a 14.1" wide. And that's where the second 14.x" wide display comes in. Most wide displays are moving toward a 16:10 aspect ratio.</p>
<p>There is something wrong on Alienware's site. If you go to its Sentia m3450 <a href="http://www.alienware.com/product_detail_pages/Sentia_m3450/sentia_specs.aspx?SysCode=PC-LT-SENTIA-3450&amp;SubCode=SKU-DEFAULT#pdp-nav">"Tech Specs" page</a>, it states the display as having a 14.1" wide screen with 1280 x 768 resolution. There is no such display! I thought Alienware knew their stuff. Maybe getting bought out by Dell wasn't such a good idea... I really don't know which display the Sentia m3450 has!?!</p>

<p>Alienware, again, shows that they are no expert when it comes to display technical specifications. On the <a href="http://www.alienware.com/product_pages/notebook_all_default.aspx">Area-51 page</a>, the m5550 display information says the 15.4" wide display has a resolution of 1280 x 768. Yeah right! No such thing! However, when you dive into the <a href="http://www.alienware.com/product_detail_pages/Area-51_m5550/area-51m_specs.aspx?SysCode=PC-LT-AREA51M5550-R3&amp;SubCode=SKU-DEFAULT#pdp-nav">"Tech Specs" page</a>, the Area-51 m5550 has a 15.4" with 1280 x 800 resolution (this is correct). What is up with these guys? By the way, if you are serious about playing games, I would go for the 1920 x 1200 resolution: make sure to get the fastest CPU and the nVidia GeForce Go 7600 with 256MB RAM and the faster 7200RPM hard drive.</p>

<p>The Area-51 m5750 has the larger 17" display. This time, Alienware gets it right: 1440 x 900 and 1920 x 1200 resolutions. If you're getting a 17" machine, might as well get the 1920 x 1200 resolution. The m5750 beats out its smaller sibling with a more powerful ATi Mobility Radeon X1800 with 256MB RAM.</p>
