<p>Paul Thurrott (@thurrott), a fairly well-known Microsoft blogger, tweeted this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Just to be clear, the June Zune rumors are *not* about the Zune HD. Which is coming out in September. :)</blockquote><br />
The fourth-generation Zune was expected to be unveiled by Microsoft later this fall. If you believe Thurrott, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/04/15/zunehd-oled-multitouch-display/">the much anticipated Zune HD</a> now has a date: September. Some have already guessed September as the launch month for the Zune HD but coming from someone within Microsoft seems to solidify those rumors.</p>
<p>What is all the fuss about? How does a large multitouch OLED display coupled with Windows Mobile 7 encased in sexy aluminum sound to you? More importantly it gives some much-needed competition to Apple's iPod franchise. I'm a true believer that fair competition leads to better products at lower prices leading to more value to the customer. Thank you Aaron for the tip!</p>
