<p><a href="http://www.displaysearch.com/cps/rde/xchg/displaysearch/hs.xsl/110727_2011_tv_market_outlook_reduced_in_latest_forecast.asp">DisplaySearch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[...] the total global TV shipment outlook for 2011 has been reduced by about 3% to 252 million units, as demand in many developed countries continues to be very soft.</blockquote></p>
<p>Director of North American TV Research, Paul Gagnon:</p>
<blockquote><p>Demand in emerging markets like China, Latin America, and India is continuing to grow strongly with a relatively low level of flat panel TV household penetration; this will more than offset slowdowns in developed regions.</blockquote></p>
<p>If that's the case, why the reduction in forecast?</p>
