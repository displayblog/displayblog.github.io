<p>Motorola might be Google's favorite company to work on the Android 3.0 tablet according to Mingchi Kuo, Digitimes Research Senior Analyst. Motorola and Google along with a telecom partner (likely Verizon) will have the rights to label their names on the device. The platform is expected to be NVIDIA's Tegra 2 and a Sharp 10.1-inch LCD, which is less bright than the 9.7-inch IPS LCD in the iPad but will be thinner. Mass production is slated for end of 2010.
