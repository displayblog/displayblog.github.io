<p><a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/video-problems-reported-by-early-macbook-air-adopters/67078">Cult of Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve also encountered a video problem on my 13-inch MacBook Air. I observed horizontal sparkling bands running up and down the screen, but the computer did not freeze. Subsequently after rebooting the problem hasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t happened again.</blockquote></p>
<p>That's not good and could be a sign of defective driver ICs, the firmware or the GPU.</p>
<blockquote><p>... my Editor Leander Kahney, myself, and others have experienced kernel panics on their new MacBook Airs. Leander saw two kernel panics on a 13-inch model and one on an 11-inch model. </blockquote></p>
