<p><a href="http://www.redmondpie.com/discover-your-most-used-apps-with-app-stat-for-iphone/">Ben Reid, Redmond Pie</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Called <em>App Stat</em>, it provides detailed figures regarding your app usage &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; namely how often you use them, and how long for.</blockquote></p>
<p>You need a jailbroken iOS 5 iPhone, unfortunately. With App Stat you now have indisputable evidence that nearly 80% of the apps you have on your iPhone almost never get used. I just counted; I have 41 apps on my iPhone with 24 in two folders. With an app like App Stat I can without doubt and hesitation remove those I seldom or never use and get closer to a focused minimalism: without distraction and having only the apps I need and use.</p>
