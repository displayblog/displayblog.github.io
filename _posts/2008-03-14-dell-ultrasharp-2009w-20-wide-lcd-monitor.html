<p>A LCD monitor with dynamic contrast ratio! 2000:1 is pretty good. It's just a guess but I'm thinking the CCFL-based backlight has either a local dimming or pulsing capability. The CCFLs are the Wide Color Gamut (WCG-CCFL) variety which is becoming more common. With any LCD monitor that sports more than the typical 72% NTSC I would recommend getting a color calibration tool, especially if you are in a profession that requires accurate colors. You never know what CIE coordinates these monitors have. Other than the features already mentioned, the $289 price seems to be good, but in light of this 'UltraSharp' not having RCA inputs to use as a video source for a DVD player, a PS2 and others, I would have liked to see this come out at $249 since it's only semi-UltraSharp.</p>
<p>Update 2008.04.15<br />
At <a href="http://digg.com/hardware/Dell_Ultra_Sharp_2009W">digg</a>, someone states that "Dell is once again releasing a top notch LCD monitor: Dell Ultra Sharp 2009W." Let's see if this statement holds true by looking at some specifications of Dell's new UltraSharp 2009W.</p>
<p>Let's first look at the cool specs. The 102% NTSC color gamut is great. The 2000:1 dynamic contrast ratio is cool too and will enhance the picture of video. These two features will really enhance the gaming experience for you hardcore gamers out there.</p>
<p>Now on to the not-so-great stuff. The 5ms response time for it to turn on and off might sound like it's pretty fast, but it's actually on the slow slide since many are putting Gray-To-Gray (GTG) or Toff-Ton-Toff response times of less than 8ms. Since it is a regular 20" the pixel format is limited to 1680 x 1050. If you've been reading my posts for a while, you know that I really don't like this in-between pixel format. If you're a real gamer, splurge on a display that has a pixel format of 1920 x 1200 (and make sure you get a powerful GPU to drive it). The last weak point is the awful viewing angle. Don't think about moving your head up and down when you're gaming since colors and brightness will shift. The 170/160 viewing angles of the 2009W is subpar and tells me this monitor uses the TN+Film LCD kind.</p>
