<p><a href="http://variety.com/2015/digital/news/netflix-viewing-abc-cbs-fox-nbc-1201527442/">Todd Spangler, Variety</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If Netflix were a Nielsen-rated TV network, the No. 1 streaming service would, within a year, attain a larger 24-hour audience than each of the major broadcast networks &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; according to a Wall Street analyst firm.</blockquote></p>
<p>June 2016 is far into the future, and I am certain no human knows what will happen by then. But some of us try. The Wall Street analyst firm &mdash; we all know how accurate Wall Street analyst firms are when it comes to predicting the future &mdash; is FBR Capital Markets whose analysts Barton Crockett and Chase White wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Netflix subscribers clearly like it more than pay TV, which we see as arguing for pricing leverage, since pay TV, on average, costs over $80 per month.</blockquote></p>
<p>The average monthly cost for Netflix: $8.</p>
<p>We haven't had pay TV for many years and don't plan to go back. Will the U.S. be watching Netflix more than ABC or Fox in about a year? Who knows. If I had it my way, I'd pay <em>only</em> for the shows I watch and not bother paying a penny more for shows I don't. For example: $10 for 10 episodes of <i>Game of Thrones</i>. Maybe a little less since this last season was less exciting than previous seasons. And when the show is done for the season I don't need to keep paying a monthly subscription.</p>
<p>What drives Netflix and other online video streaming services are widely available access to fast and affordable broadband. Our one-year low-price deal with Comcast ended last month so we've been bumped down from 50mbps to 3mbps (we're paying the same amount). So in about a month we will be saying hello to Sonic (no bump downs after a year): 20mbps for the same price with a couple nifty extras. Competition is a good thing.</p>
