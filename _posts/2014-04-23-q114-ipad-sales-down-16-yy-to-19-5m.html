<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/4/23/5643710/apple-posts-10-2b-in-profit-on-45-6b-in-revenue-announces-stock-split">Josh Lowensohn, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>One other closely watched metric is iPad sales, which were down 16 percent from the 19.5 million the company sold during the same quarter last year. Wall Street was expecting a modest improvement of 20 to 22 million units sold. In a call with analysts, Apple's VP of finance Luca Maestri said the company viewed the drop in sales as closer to a 3 percent decline due to year over year channel inventory changes. Cook also chimed in, trying to put the overall sales of the iPad in comparison with the company's other products.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;We've sold over 210 million, which is more than we or anyone thought was possible in that period of time,&acirc;&euro; Cook told analysts. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;That's almost twice as many iPhones as we've sold in a comparable amount of time... we've come a long way, very very quickly.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>That's the past, and the past looks pretty rosy for the iPad. A 16% Y/Y unit sales decline isn't though. Do you know what I think is happening? Large smartphones like the HTC One series, Samsung Galaxy S series, Galaxy Tab series, LG G series, Samsung Xperia Z series, etc. are happening. They question the need for a tablet, especially the smaller 7.x-inch ones. The rumored <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/04/22/lg-g3/">LG G3 will have a pixel format of 2560x1440</a> (3.68 megapixels), which is considerably more than the retina iPads (2048x1536, 3.14 megapixels) have. Resolution, or pixel density, is not even close: 534 ppi vs. 326 ppi for the retina iPad mini. With these large smartphones you get some of the size, almost all of the pixels, and a lot more portability.</p>
<p>I am starting to dislike the complexity of having to manage two devices (iPhone and iPad) and would rather have one device in the middle. That's exactly what these large smartphones offer. Now if a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/04/21/5-5-inch-iphone-6/">5.5-inch iPhone 6</a> were to be an option...</p>
