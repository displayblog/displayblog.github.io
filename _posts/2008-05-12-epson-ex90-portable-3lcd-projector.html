<p>On May 12, 2008, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=epson">Epson</a> announced its EX90 portable <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=front-projection">projector</a> geared for the business market. The EX90 features the company's twin-optimized reflective E-TORL technology that enhance lamp lifetimes of up to 50%. E-TORL technology also enhances light efficiency so that less power is consumed to generate the same brightness compared to other projectors. If lamp lifetime or efficiency was such as great concern, I would recommend using <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led">LED</a> as a light source. Free tip, Epson.</p>
<p>The 3LCD display technology does not have a color wheel that can lead to some detecting a rainbow effect. The EX90 also takes just 5 seconds to start up. Epson uses the words "Instant On" but I'm not thinking that a whole 5 seconds, though quick, can be considered instant. There is no cool-down period required before packing up and leaving (necessary when the sales pitch didn't go well). Oh, one more thing: although Epson states that its EX90 is portable and extra 6lbs is going to greatly shorten the total distance you can walk with it, so make sure to park close to the entrance.</p>
