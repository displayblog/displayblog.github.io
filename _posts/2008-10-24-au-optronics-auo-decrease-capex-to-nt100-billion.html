<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=au-optronics">AU Optronics</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=auo">AUO</a>) originally planned a CAPEX of NT$130 to NT$140 billion for CY2008. According to the company's president L.J. Chen, AUO will be decreasing it to NT$100 billion. The main reason for the decline is the company's changed plans for its <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=g7.5">G7.5</a> TFT LCD fabrication plant. The G7.5 fab is currently in Phase I with a total glass substrate input capacity of 30,000 per month. Mass production from its G7.5 fab will commence in Q3'09. At around the same time, AUO's <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=g8.5">G8.5</a> fab with roughly the same capacity will begin mass production as well. Phase II for the G7.5 fab has been pushed back to 2010. The reasons are understandable: demand for LCD goods, especially <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a>s, are uncertain and it is anyone's guess what will happen in Q4'08. CAPEX in 2009 is expected to be less than NT$100 billion but depends on how the global economy fairs next year.</p>
