<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Concept_Coke_Sugar_Powered_Nokia_Phone.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9076 aligncenter" title="Concept_Coke_Sugar_Powered_Nokia_Phone" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Concept_Coke_Sugar_Powered_Nokia_Phone.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="450" /></a>Chinese designer Daizi Zheng has designed a concept phone that is powered by Coke. Well, sugar to be exact. Screw off the top and pour Coke into cylindrical Nokia and expect the phone to last longer than a traditional Lithium Ion batteries by a factor of three to four. Daizi Zheng:</p></p>
<blockquote><p>The concept is using bio battery to replace the traditional battery to create a pollution free environment. Bio battery is an ecologically friendly energy generates electricity from carbohydrates (currently sugar) and utilizes enzymes as the catalyst. By using bio battery as the power source of the phone, it only needs a pack of sugary drink and it generates water and oxygen while the battery dies out.</blockquote><br />
Brilliant concept, but will need to solve the problem of phones getting messy.
