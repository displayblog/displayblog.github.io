<p><a href="http://www.displaysearch.com/cps/rde/xchg/displaysearch/hs.xsl/110810_german_tv_purchases_not_motivated_by_cutting_edge_features.asp">DisplaySearch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Results of the recently published DisplaySearch <a href="http://www.displaysearch.com/cps/rde/xchg/displaysearch/hs.xsl/global_tv_replacement_study.asp"><em>Global TV Replacement Study</em></a> suggest that German consumers barely show an interest in new technologies like 3D or Internet-TV, despite record-setting sales of new flat screen displays.</blockquote></p>
<p>Sensible German folks. Dig a little deeper and it might be surprising to TV brands that most of the world don't care for 3D or Internet connectivity. I'll tell you what gets me excited: improvements in picture quality.</p>
