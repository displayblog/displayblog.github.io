<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-13/samsung-supplies-apple-with-touch-screen-for-new-ipad.html">Jun Yang, Bloomberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Samsung, the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s top flat-panel maker, currently is the sole vendor of the display for the 9.7-inch device, said Vinita Jakhanwal, a senior manager at iSuppli, a unit of Englewood, Colorado-based IHS Inc.</blockquote></p>
<p>According to my sources LG Display will soon get on board and then Sharp.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.03.16:</em> <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120316/apples-new-ipad-costs-at-least-316-to-build-ihs-isuppli-teardown-shows/">Arik Hesseldahl, AllThingsD</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>So what did they find inside? An expensive Samsung display, for one thing. All those millions of pixels don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t come cheap. ISuppli analyst Andrew Rassweiler estimates that the display, which cost $57 on the iPad 2, has grown in cost to $87 on the latest iPad.</p>
<p>Rassweiler says that two other vendors, LG Display and Sharp Electronics, have inked display supply deals with Apple for the latest iPad, but only Samsung is thought to have fully ramped up production. Depending on the vendor, the display may cost as much as $90, he said.</blockquote></p>
