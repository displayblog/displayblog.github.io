<p>The entire article titled "<a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/3826/motorola-droid-x-thoroughly-reviewed/19">Motorola Droid X: Thoroughly Reviewed</a>" is a must-read if you want to know the ins and outs of the Droid X in great detail. Here I will focus on what Brian Klug and Anand Lal Shimpi found out about the display.</p>
<p>The Droid X makes use of a rather large 4.3-inch TFT LCD with a 854x480 pixel format. The aspect ratio is 16:9 and the same pixel format is used on the original Droid and the Motoroi.</p>
<p>White display brightness in nits (cd/m2):</p>
<p>iPhone 4: 571<br />
iPhone 3GS: 469<br />
Motorola Droid X: 440<br />
Motorola Droid: 427<br />
HTC EVO 4G: 357<br />
Nokia N900: 257<br />
Nexus One: 234<br />
HTC Droid Incredible: 204</p>
<p>Higher is better and the Droid X in this bunch comes at #3. High brightness helps when looking at the display out in the sun.</p>
<p>Black display brightness in nits (cd/m2):</p>
<p>iPhone 3GS: 2.5<br />
Nokia N900: 0.74<br />
HTC EVO 4G: 0.64<br />
iPhone 4: 0.6<br />
Motorola Droid X: 0.5<br />
Motorola Droid: 0.3<br />
Nexus One: 0<br />
HTC Droid Incredible: 0</p>
<p>Lower is better. Both the Nexus One and HTC Droid Incredible is 0 because they use an OLED panel, which is an emissive display technology. When it is black there is zero light coming out. Both the Droid X and the original Droid do extremely well for a LCD.</p>
<p>Display contrast:</p>
<p>Motorola Droid: 1418<br />
iPhone 4: 952<br />
Motorola Droid X: 873<br />
HTC EVO 4G: 557<br />
Nokia N900: 349<br />
iPhone 3GS: 188</p>
<p>Higher is better. I am not sure why there is such a big difference between the Droid X and the original Droid, but it may have something to do with a bit more light leaking out (black display brightness) on the Droid X compared to the Droid. A higher screen reflectance on the Droid X, which wasn't measured, might be a potential answer to the big difference.</p>
<p>Contrast can be enhanced two ways. Assuming black levels stay the same the display brightness can be improved. There are a few ways to accomplish higher brightness including better light transparency or simply a more powerful backlight. The other method of improving overall contrast is to minimize light leakage and lowering black brightness levels.</p>
