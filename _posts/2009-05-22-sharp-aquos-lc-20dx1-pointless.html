  is the world's first 20\" LCD TV with a built-in Blu-ray player. The LC-20DX1 comes
  in either black or white, features a digital TV tuner, 1500:1 contrast ratio and
  450 cd/m2 of brightness. Pretty decent specs. The design isn't all that bad
  either. The most important feature and most unfortunate at the same time is the
  20\" TFT LCD panel: it sports a 1366 x 768 pixel format. That's 720p for you. Blu-ray
  equals 1080p. This 20\" LCD equals 720p. We've got a problem. "

<p>The LC-20DX1 from <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250:8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID:11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=sharp&amp;sa=Search">Sharp</a> is the world's first 20" LCD TV with a built-in Blu-ray player.

<p>The lack of a 1080p-capable LCD panel makes the built-in Blu-ray reader in the LC-20DX1 utterly pointless. Actually the entire LC-20DX1 concept is pointless.&Acirc;&nbsp;Unless Blu-ray comes out with 720p titles.</p>
<p>&Acirc;&yen;150,000 (about US$1600) is the cost of entry. That will get you an overpriced 20" LCD TV with a built-in Blu-ray reader. Another thing to consider: most likely the Blu-ray reader will break before the TV does. Then what?</p>
<p>My recommendation is to get yourself a much larger <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250:8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID:11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=46"+lcd+tv&amp;sa=Search">46" 1080p LCD TV</a> and a much better and separate Blu-ray player for the same price.</p>
