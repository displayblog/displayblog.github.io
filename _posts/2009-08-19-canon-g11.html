<p><a href="http://www.canonusa.com/templatedata/pressrelease/20090819_powershot.html">Canon</a>: Do you have a DSLR? When you're getting ready to take the kids to the park or on a mini-vacation do you cringe at the thought of having to lug that big DSLR? More than 80-percent of the time I just grab my tiny Canon compact digital camera and go. Yes, picture quality will suffer but at least I'll <em>actually</em> get some pictures. But is there a compact-ish digital camera that takes pictures like DSLRs that I can take with me almost everywhere I go? I thought I had the answer when I was researching Panasonic's DMC-LX3 yesterday night. It goes for, mmm... it <em>was</em> going for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CCLBSA?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=displ0f-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001CCLBSA">$499.99 on Amazon</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=displ0f-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B001CCLBSA" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> (I did note that Amazon had just one in stock). Now the price has jumped to $630! Maybe that's not so bad since thanks to <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=canon&amp;sa=Search#1530">Canon</a>.</p>
<p>Canon just announced the G11, the successor to the G10. The G-Series from Canon have been the flagship compact digital cameras and have earned many positive reviews over the years. According to Canon, the G11 is: "Designed for those looking for a pocket-sized camera with SLR functionality." If Canon's claim is true that this little G11 is what I have been searching for, what relief! But I must stay calm until real reviews come in since the small portion of my brain that is logical is telling me that a marketing person wrote that. I used to be a marketing person and I know that things can be exaggerated. Just a bit.</p>
<p>Here are some specifications to back that claim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Image Sensor: 10.0 Megapixel 1/1.7-inch CCD High Sensitivity System</li>
<li>Lens: Optically Image Stabilized 6.1-30.5mm (28-140mm 35mm film equivalent) f/2.8-4.5 with 5x Optical Zoom</li>
<li>Monitor: 2.8-inch VGA vari-angle PureColor System LCD</li>
<li>ISO: 80/100/200/400/800/1600/3200</li>
<li>Storage: SD/SDHC, MMC/MMCplus, HDC MMCplus</li>
<li>Image: JPG, CR2 (RAW) with Maximum Resolution of 3648 x 2736</li>
<li>Movie: MOV (H.264) at 640 x 480/30fps</li>
<li>Two Mode Dials: Adjust ISO, Exposure Compensation, Recording Modes (RAW+JPG)</li>
<li>Flash: Built-in, Speedlite Flash System Compatibility</li>
<li>Availability: October 2009</li>
<li>Price: Estimated at US$499.99</li><br />
</ul><br />
That is an excellent price. I think. Maybe not. When you compare that price to a low-end DSLR, for instance a Canon's Rebel XS with a EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS is going for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CBKJGG?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=displ0f-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001CBKJGG">$499.00 on Amazon</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=displ0f-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B001CBKJGG" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />, the $499.99 price for the G11 seems a bit high. Of course, the G11 street price should go down a bit when it becomes available but as you can see a low-end DSLR with a kit lens plays in the same price territory.&Acirc;&nbsp;Sure the G11 is much smaller but the Rebel XS probably takes much better pictures, even despite the G11 having optical image stabilization. The correct marketing message should be: "Designed for those looking for a large pocket-sized camera with SLR functionality and price."</p>
