<p>Craig Timberg, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/09/18/newest-androids-will-join-iphones-in-offering-default-encryption-blocking-police/">The Washington Post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Android has offered optional encryption on some devices since 2011, but security experts say few users have known how to turn on the feature. Now Google is designing the activation procedures for new Android devices so that encryption happens automatically; only somebody who enters a device's password will be able to see the pictures, videos and communications stored on those smartphones.</blockquote></p>
<p>How about pictures, videos, and communication stored at Google?</p>
