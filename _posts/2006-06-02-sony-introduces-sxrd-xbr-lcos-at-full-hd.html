<p>SXRD is Sony&#39;s name for LCoS (Liquid Crystal on Silicon) technology. SXRD stands for Silicon X-tal Reflective Display. The new SXRD XBR units feature full HD pixel formats of 1920 x 1080 and has HDMI inputs. Sizes range from 50" to 70".</p>
<p>KDS-R70XBR2: A 70" SXRD Grand WEGA TV, $7800<br />
KDS-R60XBR2: A 60" SXRD Grand WEGA TV, $5300</p>
<p>Both use a three-chip design with each chip a diagonal size of 0.61" for each R-G-B color. In Cinema Black Pro mode, the SXRD XBR units can deliver 10,000:1 contrast ratios. Impressive. These two will be available in Fall 2006.</p>
<p>LCoS, in my opinion, is the epitome of video fidelity as the pixel elements are not as sharp as DLP. Black levels are better than most LCD TVs and LCoS does not have image burn-in issues that plasma has.</p>
