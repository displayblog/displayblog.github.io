<blockquote><p>4:3 is a good balance for a device that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s meant to be used in either orientation.</blockquote></p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/07/02/ipad-2-0-a-more-perfect-ipad/"><em>iPad 2.0: A More Perfect iPad</em><em></em></a> I explore the idea of an iPad that's a bit taller (or narrower):</p>
<blockquote><p>Putting all of this together, a more per fect iPad 2.0 would sport roughly a 10-inch display with a 1.4 aspect ratio. It is just a bit wider in landscape and a little skinnier in portrait than the current iPad and should be better at displaying all three media: documents, photographs, moving pictures while making it easier to touch-type with all ten fingers in land&Acirc;&shy;scape mode.</blockquote></p>
