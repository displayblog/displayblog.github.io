<p>Yes, it seems all displays are transitioning to wide. So what's up with <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=panasonic">Panasonic</a>'s Toughbook T8? It's got a 4:3 LCD with a pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1024-x-768">1024 x 768</a>, which is good for surfing, but not so good for wide stuff, like HD. Well, the Toughbook T8 is geared for folks that work and work hard, literally. With a shock-mounted HDD and a semi-rugged magnesium alloy exterior, the Toughbook T8 is drop and spill-resistant. It is classified by Panasonic has 'business-rugged', which is a tad bit less rugged than semi-rugged and then there's the fully-rugged machines. The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=12.1"">12.1"</a> LCD is also <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=touch">touch</a> capable. I am assuming it is resistive. I've always wanted a notebook PC that can weather the drops, spills and curious children. :-) For that, I would probably need a Toughbook 52 or 74 (semi-rugged).</p>
