<blockquote><p>Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s pre-event weeks are often spent soliciting demonstrations from many app developers and preparing demonstrations of those apps for the live event. Our sources tell us that this selection process is continuing at an increased rate as Apple looks to finalize the lineup for the iPad 3. There is also emphasis on graphics-oriented applications with high-definition assets, which appears to be in line with the new iPad featuring a &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Retina&acirc;&euro;&trade; display.</blockquote></p>
<p>The pace of iPad 3 rumors are accelerating. <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120209/apple-to-announce-ipad-3-first-week-in-march/">John Paczkowski</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sources say the company has chosen the first week in March to debut the successor to the iPad 2, and will do so at one of its trademark special events. The event will be held in San Francisco, presumably at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s preferred location for big announcements like these.</blockquote></p>
<p>Probably true.</p>
