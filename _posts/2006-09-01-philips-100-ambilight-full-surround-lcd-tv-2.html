<p>Although I am not able to be in Berlin for the IFA, the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s largest consumer electronics trade show, according to IFA&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <a href="http://www1.messe-berlin.de/vip8_1/website/MesseBerlin/htdocs/www.ifa-berlin/en/About_IFA/index.html">website</a>, thanks to the millions of websites that track what is going on around the world, I can virtually be there. Philips is part of the show at IFA and the company is showcasing its 100&acirc;&euro;&sup3; Ambilight LCD TV. Of course, the panel is sourced from LG.Philips LCD and the world saw the 100&acirc;&euro;&sup3; first at SID 2006 at the Moscone Center in San Francisco a few month back.</p>

<p>The 100&acirc;&euro;&sup3; monster uses Philips&acirc;&euro;&trade; Pixel Plus 3HD processing that processes each pixel by looking at the surrounding pixels to provide a more natural picture. More information can be found in <a href="http://displayblog.wordpress.com/2006/05/22/philips-clear-lcd-and-pixel-plus-3hd/">a previous blog</a> about the technology. The Ambilight is a Full Surround version that creates an immersive viewing experience that matches color and brightness to the images being displayed on the TV, on all four sides. There is another version of the Ambilight called merely Surround (without the Full) and light is matched on only three sides.</p>
