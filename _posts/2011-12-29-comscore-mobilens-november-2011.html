<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/comscore-mobile-subscriber-market-share-2011-12">Business Insider</a>. comScore outed its MobiLens report comparing the three month average ending November 2011 versus the three month average ending August 2011.</p>
<p>Top U.S. Smartphone Platform</p>
<ol>
<li>Google: 43.8% &rarr; 46.9%, +3.1</li>
<li>Apple: 27.3% &rarr; 28.7%, +1.4</li>
<li>RIM: 19.7% &rarr; 16.6%, -3.1</li>
<li>Microsoft: 5.7% &rarr; 5.2%, -0.5</li>
<li>Symbian: 1.8% &rarr; 1.5%, -0.3</li><br />
</ol></p>
<p>No surprises here. Android and iOS are it. A mere coincidence I'm sure, but it looks like Android's +3.1 came from RIM's -3.1.</p>
<p>Top U.S. Mobile OEMs</p>
<ol>
<li>Samsung: 25.3% &rarr; 25.6%, +0.3</li>
<li>LG: 21.0% &rarr; 20.5%, -0.5</li>
<li>Motorola: 14.0% &rarr; 13.7%, -0.3</li>
<li>Apple: 9.8% &rarr; 11.2%, +1.4</li>
<li>RIM: 7.1% &rarr; 6.5%, -0.6</li><br />
</ol></p>
<p>These numbers are for all mobile phones including non-smartphones. <a href="http://www.minimallyminimal.com/journal/2011/11/16/coffee-time-market-share-vs-profit.html">As of November 16 Samsung sold 134 models in the U.S.</a> On average that's about 0.2% per phone. What is amazing to me is Apple captured 11.2% with just three.</p>
