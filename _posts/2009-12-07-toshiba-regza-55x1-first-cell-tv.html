The 55-inch 1080p LCD TV sports a LED backlight, which is unfortunate because back in CES 2009 Toshiba was touting its Cell TV with Resolution+. The Cell processor was used to upscale all video sources up to 4K2K or QuadHD (3840x2160). Now it's just the standard 1920 x 1080. Original specifications included a lot of fantastic features: The LED backlight sports 512 blocks instead of the usual 96 for a 55-inch class TV so brightness is more finely tuned for greater contrast rated at 5,000,000:1. Brightness was originally spec'd at a blinding 1250 cd/m2. The refresh rate is 240Hz to minimize motion blur.</p>
