<p>Sony's plasma TV shipments were 100,000 units in FY2005 (ending March 31, 2006), which was down from 300,000 units in FY2004. That's down 67% year-over-year. One reason for this, according to Katsumi Ihara, the Executive Deputy President of Sony's Procurement Strategies, is due to a lack of a vertically-aligned plasma display panel (PDP) manufacturing source. Instead, Sony will concentrate on LCD TVs. With its S-LCD joint venture with Samsung, Sony has a strong source of LCD TV panels and will increase the 40"+ LCD TVs to more than 50% by the end of 2006.</p>

Sony plasma TV: KE-P42 MRX1</p>
<p>Recently Sony signed an agreement with Samsung to jointly invest in a G8 fab, a fab that will focus on 50"+ LCD TV sizes. Monthly capacity is slated for 50,000 glass substrates per month and will start mass production in the fall of 2007.&Acirc;&nbsp; Sony is targeting 8 million LCD TV shipments in FY2007.</p>
<p>Sony has had a long love-hate relationship with plasma dating back to 2004. At that time <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2004/12/20/sony-to-stop-selling-plasma-tvs/">Engadget</a> posted an article stating that Sony would stop plasma TV production. Later that year, Sony stated that it would continue making plasma TVs, according to an article on <a href="http://www.cnet.com.au/tvs/plasma/0,39035288,40003222,00.htm">c|net</a>. Who knows what exactly will happen. May Sony can enter into a joint venture with a PDP maker such as... Pioneer?</p>
