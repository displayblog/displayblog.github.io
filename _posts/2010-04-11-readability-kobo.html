<p><a href="http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/">Readability</a> is an arc90 laboratory experiment:</p>
<blockquote><p>READABILITY is a simple tool that makes reading on the Web more enjoyable by removing the clutter around what you're reading. Follow the steps below to install READABILITY in your Web browser.</blockquote><br />
<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Kobo_eReader.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-10247 aligncenter" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" title="Kobo_eReader" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Kobo_eReader.jpg" alt="" width="382" height="628" /></a>What an experiment! I read, a lot, and make use of both high-tech (notebook LCD) and low-tech (paper). Although there has been a lot of excitement over the iPad as an e-reader, the excitement over the iPad is because it is more than just an e-reader. I am not sure what it is but I'm appreciating the simpler things in life. Readability makes the reading experience on my MacBook Pro significantly more pleasurable precisely because it allows me to focus on reading by stripping away all unnecessary crap that is usually littered all over the webpage. Unfortunately I still need to deal with the Safari menu, other URL bar, other tabs, buttons, and so forth. I want a reading experience that is without <em>any</em> distractions. I would like to share a possible solution.</p>
<p>What prompted this desire for even more simplicity was Kobo's eReader (Image Source: <a href="http://www.electronista.com/reviews/kobo-ereader.html">electronista</a>). Unlike many other e-readers the Kobo eReader is simple and excludes features such as 3G, a touch display and WiFi. My only two wishes would be Bluetooth and a more integrated less conspicuous directional pad. I would want a simpler e-reader, more an e-display than an e-reader, than even Kobo's to be used as a display primarily for reading. It would work like this:</p>
<p>Click on Readability and the simple stripped-down version would be shown on the e-display instead of on the MBP. I think it will work since when I click on Readability all I want to do is read, and nothing else. Information, which I would assume will be rather small in terms of size, will be sent via the Bluetooth connection in a near-instant. (I prefer a wireless solution to a wired one and Bluetooth came up due to two reasons: less power and a lot of speed is not required.) I can then pick up the e-display and concentrate on reading without <em>any</em> distractions. The eReader from Kobo goes for US$149. My e-display concept would be considerably less.</p>
