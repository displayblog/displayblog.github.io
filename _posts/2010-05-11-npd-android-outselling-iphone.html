<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/NPD_Mobile_OS_Q1_2010.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-10554 aligncenter" title="NPD_Mobile_OS_Q1_2010" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/NPD_Mobile_OS_Q1_2010.jpg" alt="" width="511" height="342" /></a></p><br />
According to NPD, Google's Android mobile operating system captured 28% of the US market while Apple's iPhone OS took 21% in Q1'10. Research In Motion's (RIM) BlackBerry OS maintained its top rank with 36%. First, this is limited to the US. Also, keep in mind that this information from NPD is based on <em>self-reported</em> online consumer surveys and is vastly different from the point-of-sale (POS) numbers that the company reports. I wouldn't put too much credence into this data point. I would also like to know how many consumers responded to NPD's survey. For a more accurate report I would wait until NPD publishes its POS report. via <a href="http://mediamemo.allthingsd.com/20100510/is-android-really-outselling-apple/">MediaMemo</a></p>
<p>PS: I wonder why even very smart guys like <a href="http://technologizer.com/2010/05/10/it-would-be-kind-of-stunning-if-android-phones-werent-outselling-iphones/">Harry McCracken</a> automatically believe stuff that comes out of market research companies like NPD. Be stunned because I doubt Android phones are outselling iPhones. The simple reason being there are many more ordinary folks than geeks.</p>
<p>PPS: Ah, finally. The total number of self-reporting consumers to NPD's survey... is... 150,000. When millions are being sold each quarter, the number of survey respondents points to a statistically insignificant finding.
