<p>Bill Gates on the iPad:</p>
<blockquote><p>It's a nice reader, but there's nothing on the iPad I look at and say, 'Oh, I wish Micosoft had done it.'</blockquote><br />
Gates favors a netbook, with a mixture of inputs: voice, pen, and keyboard. Source: <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/02/11/bill_gates_unimpressed_by_apple_ipad.html">AppleInsider</a></p>
