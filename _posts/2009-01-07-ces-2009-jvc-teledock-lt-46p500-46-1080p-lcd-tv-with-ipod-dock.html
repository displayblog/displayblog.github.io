<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=jvc">JVC</a> announced its TeleDock line of LCD TVs at CES 2009. There are five models: LT-32P300 (32"), LT-42P300 (42"), LT-46P300 (46") and two Clear Motion Drive models: LT-42P500 (42") and LT-46P500 (46"). I'll focus on the largest and best, the LT-46P500.</p>
<p>The LT-46P500 features a 45.9" TFT LCD panel with a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a> pixel format allowing it to take <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1080p">1080p</a> HD video content and display it without scaling. JVC mentioned a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dynamic-backlight">dynamic backlight</a> technology and that should improve the contrast ratio somewhat. The LT-46P500 also can display 1080p content at 24fps so film won't need to get botched during the 3:2 pull-down process and can be seen just the way it was supposed to be seen. The LT-46P500 is also part of the Clear Motion Drive line that sport a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=120hz">120Hz</a> frequency.</p>
<p>The TeleDock line of LCD TVs from JVC allows you to dock your iPod right in the TV. There is a flip-down iPod dock at the base of the LCD TV. You can play back videos, music and photos. The LT-46P500's remote, with a similar wheel, can directly control the iPod. How nice is that. The iPod is not only providing all the multimedia but is getting recharged as well, even when the TV is sleeping. I'm not exactly sure if you'll get really nice video out of the iPod and onto the LT-46P500 without some type of built-in 1080p upconversion.</p>
