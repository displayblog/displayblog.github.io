<blockquote><p>[...] Again, the typography (and type rendering) are poor in Project. And I find the navigation to be frustrating. You swipe left-right to page between different articles, and up-down to &acirc;&euro;&oelig;scroll&acirc;&euro;¬ù between the pages of a multipage article. [..]</blockquote></p>
<p>First, typography should be a focus since the effort will clearly bear fruit on such a beautiful display. It should be even more important when iPad 2.0 comes out. Second, we flip magazine pages sideways. Some flip it left to right and others right to left but either way we flip pages on a magazine sideways. That's how we read and we have been reading magazines this way for decades. This new UI makes us strain when all we want to do is experience the pleasure of reading.</p>
