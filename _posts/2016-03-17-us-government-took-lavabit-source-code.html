<p>[ <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/us-government-pushed-tech-firms-to-hand-over-source-code/">ZDNet</a> ] Zack Whittaker:</p>
<blockquote><p>When asked, a spokesperson for the Justice Dept. acknowledged that the department has demanded source code and private encryption keys before. In a recent filing against Apple, the government <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/unsealed-docs-show-what-really-happened-with-lavabit/">cited a 2013 case</a> where it won a court order demanding that Lavabit, an encrypted email provider said to have been used by whistleblower Edward Snowden, must turn over its source code and private keys. The Justice Dept. used that same filing to imply it would, in a similar effort, <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/fbi-could-demand-apple-source-code-and-private-key-allowing-feds-to-ghost-iphones/">demand Apple's source code</a> and private keys in its ongoing case in an effort to compel the company's help by unlocking an iPhone used by the San Bernardino shooter.</blockquote></p>
<p>Unfortunately a legal precedent seems to be already present, for law enforcement authorities to take Apple's iOS source code.</p>
