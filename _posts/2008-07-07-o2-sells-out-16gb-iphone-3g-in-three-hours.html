<p><strong>Update 2008.07.09 9:29AM PST</strong><br />
According to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idINL0866623420080708?rpc=44">Reuters</a>, O2's website got hit on 13,000 times. Per SECOND. That's a lot of love for the iPhone 3G. I think there would be mad hysteria in the US if AT&T decided to give away the 8GB iPhone 3G for free (with a 2-year contract, of course) too.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/07/07/iphone-3g-launching-00-01-nz-time-home-delivered-in-the-uk/">Engadget</a>: O2, the carrier that will be selling folks in the UK the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=iphone-3g">iPhone 3G</a>, sent out a courteous notice stating that it will be taking pre-orders on a first come, first serve basis, so it can be "fair to all customers". The best part of the notice was that orders "will be delivered on 11th July by courier". The only thing is that the folks need to sign for it.</p>
<p>Now the crazy part: According to Engadget, the 16GB version of the iPhone 3G sold out at O2 in three hours. THREE HOURS. O2, the major carrier in the UK is sold out of 16GB iPhone 3Gs. Incredible.</p>
