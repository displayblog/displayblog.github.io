<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/12/5097104/cyanogenmod-arrives-in-google-play-store-with-one-click-installer-for">The Verge</a>: I wish I was, but I'm not a hacker, so to me installing CyanogenMod (CM) is a hassle. Not anymore: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.cyanogenmod.oneclick">CM released a one-click installer and is available on Google Play</a>. You need to connect the Android device to a Windows PC with a USB cable and run a companion PC app, but that's about it. Why CM? To get as much of the NSA off your back. There are more than 8 million CM users and I'm guessing that number will explode soon.</p>
