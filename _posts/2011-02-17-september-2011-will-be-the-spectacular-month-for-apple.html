<p>September will be <em>spectacular</em> for Apple. <a href="http://www.ifoapplestore.com/db/2011/02/08/apple-has-targeted-manhattan-for-fifth-store/">Gary Allen</a> is reporting that Apple will build and open the world's largest Apple Store inside Grand Central Terminal, New York, in early September. The largest today is the 16,372 square foot four-story <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/retail/coventgarden/">Apple Store, Covent Garden</a>, London, UK.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Apple_Store_Covent_Garden_London.jpg" alt="" title="Apple_Store_Covent_Garden_London" width="400" height="467" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17854" /></p>
<p>Why Grand Central Terminal? There are more than 700,000 visitors to Grand Central Terminal per day. Four Apple Stores already operate in Manhattan: Upper West Side, the glass cube on Fifth Avenue, West 14th Street, and SoHo. Apple Store, Grand Central would be just <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=Grand+Central+Station,+New+York,+10017&daddr=767+5th+Avenue+New+York,+NY+10153&hl=en&geocode=FWbXbQIdIDOX-yk1UqaBAVnCiTH3FAOcUIaxEg%3BFbUBbgIds0KX-yl3ngh08FjCiTGrZNR9m1wjdQ&mra=ltm&dirflg=w&sll=40.75883,-73.972878&sspn=0.01614,0.017574&ie=UTF8&ll=40.758635,-73.976569&spn=0.01614,0.017574&z=16">0.8 miles</a> away from the Fifth Avenue location, which is 10,000 square feet and considered by <a href="http://www.execdigital.com/business/leader/apple-s-highest-revenue-retail-store-america-holds-special-allure">Jeffrey Roseman</a> to be the highest grossing Apple Store with an estimated US$350 million in annual sales or $35,000 per square foot. Compare that to $18,000 for Tiffany & Co. and you can see how staggering that number is, for a computer / electronics store. Apple Store, Grand Central Terminal, would also serve to alleviate intense pressure from the Fifth Avenue location.</p>

<p>The opening of Apple Store, Grand Central Terminal, alone would be cause for great celebration, but I think it will also be the occasion for two more events. One, 2011 marks the tenth year anniversary of Apple retail: the company has enjoyed ten years of tremendous success with its Apple Stores and what would be a better time to celebrate than at the opening of the world's largest Apple Store? Two, I expect Apple to announce the next iPad: the Retina Display-toting <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/02/10/ipad-3/">iPad 3</a>, at the opening of the Apple Store, Grand Central Station, and shipping that very day. I'm just guessing here, but I think September is going to be spectacular for Apple.</p>
