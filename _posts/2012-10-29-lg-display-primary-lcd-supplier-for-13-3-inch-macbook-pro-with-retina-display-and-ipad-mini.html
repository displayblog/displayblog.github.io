<p>DIGITIMES &rarr; <a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/stocks/lg-display-acquires-apple-panel-orders-and-4-stocks-reaching-52-week-highs.html/">Wall St. Cheat Sheet</a>: LG Display (LGD) is the primary supplier of LCDs for Apple's new products. I'm assuming those products are the 13.3-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display and iPad mini. AUO seems to be the secondary supplier for the iPad mini.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+13-Inch+Retina+Display+Late+2012+Teardown/11225/3">iFixit tore down the 13.3-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display</a> but did not attempt to separate the display from the glass, which were fused together. The larger 15.4-inch MacBook Pro sports a LGD manufactured LCD panel with model number LP154WT1-SJ-A1-GD. Although this does not prove anything it seems to suggest LGD is humming along quite well churning out large LCDs with extremely high ppi. I'd wager LGD is in fact the primary supplier of the 13.3-inch retina LCD for the new 13.3-inch MacBook Pro.</p>
