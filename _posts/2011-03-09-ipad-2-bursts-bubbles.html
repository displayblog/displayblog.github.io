<p>J.P. Morgan Research analyst Mark Moskowitz <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/03/09/jp_morgan_apples_ipad_2_could_cause_bubble_burst_for_rival_tablets.html">AppleInsider</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In our view, the technical and form factor improvements of the iPad 2 stand to make it tougher for the first generation of competitive offerings to play catch-up, meaning actual shipments could fall well short of plan.</blockquote></p>
<p>The experience of going through one complete life cycle of a product is invaluable. Most others have yet to or just barely started shipping version one tablets. Some might call the Motorola Xoom a beta product since it will need to undergo a hardware upgrade to gain full functionality. Samsung, instead of focusing on bringing out a second version of the original 7-inch Galaxy Tab is instead working on 8.9-inch and 10.1-inch versions. Apple has stuck with a 9.7-inch LCD and will continue to do that with the iPad 3. Unfortunately, some willingly go back to the drawing board to reinvent and start the cycle all over again, missing the lessons learned from start to finish. Others are forced to go back even before getting to ship version one.</p>
