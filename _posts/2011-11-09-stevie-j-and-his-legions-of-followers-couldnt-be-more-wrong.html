<p>Here's Steve Jobs in &#8220;<a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">Thoughts on Flash</a>&#8221;, April 2010:</p>
<blockquote><p>New open standards created in the mobile era, such as HTML5, will win on mobile devices (and PCs too). Perhaps Adobe should focus more on creating great HTML5 tools for the future, and less on criticizing Apple for leaving the past behind.</blockquote></p>
<p>Now that's money.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.computerworld.com/16862/android_flash">JR Raphael, Computerworld, August 2010</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As the Android 2.2 upgrade makes it way to more and more devices (the Droid Incredible is receiving it as we speak and the Droid X should follow any day now), those of us who value choice in technology are getting the opportunity to experience the Flash-enabled mobile world first hand. Having spent some time using it and seeing how it performs, I have to say: Stevie J. and his legions of followers couldn't be more wrong.</blockquote></p>
<p>Here's <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2011/11/flash-focus.html">Danny Winokur, VP & GM of Interactive Development at Adobe on the future of Flash Player for mobile devices</a>, November 2011:</p>
<blockquote><p>We will no longer continue to develop Flash Player in the browser to work with new mobile device configurations (chipset, browser, OS version, etc.) following the upcoming release of Flash Player 11.1 for Android and BlackBerry PlayBook.</blockquote></p>
<p>One year and seven months later Adobe realizes Steve Jobs was right about Flash and HTML5. And Raphael? *crickets*</p>
