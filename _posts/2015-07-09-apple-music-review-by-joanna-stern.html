<p><a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-music-review-behind-a-messy-interface-is-musics-next-big-leap-1436300486">Joanna Stern, The Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As it stands right now, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s hard to give Apple Music my $10 a month.</p>
<p>I love how well it integrates with my own personal music collection, and recommends great music throughout the day, but there are too many bugs and frustrations to battle. And while it will work on my home Sonos speaker system, it doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t yet. For now, my $10 feels better spent with Spotify.</blockquote></p>
<p>Half baked. Apple seems to be taking a page out of Google's operations manual: get something out quickly, and don't worry about bugs, the users (beta testers) will find them for you.</p>
