<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/12/5406148/iphone-6-purported-part-leak-rear-case">The Verge</a> has photos supposedly of iPhone 6 that were leaked <em>via</em> Twitter. Most are guessing the iPhone 6 will pack a larger display by pointing to the really thin bezels on the left and right. The gap between the Home button and the bottom of the display is also really small. But I don't think so.</p>
<p>If these photos are really those of iPhone 6, Apple has managed to figure out how to pack a 4-inch display into an iPhone that's close to the size of an iPhone 4, but much thinner and designed like the back of the new iPads. What does that get us? We get back one-handed operation. Having to reorient the iPhone 5 in my hand to get to the icon at the far corner has been a thorn on the side of an otherwise solid experience. Getting a 4-inch display <em>and</em> one-handed operation would be like having your cake and eating it too.</p>
<p>And I can't be sure, but the fingerprints on the display seem to have similar characteristics to the fingerprints left on the Touch ID Home button made of sapphire. I'm betting <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2013/11/19/2014-the-year-of-the-sapphire-cover-glass/">the cover glass will be made of sapphire</a>.</p>
