<p><a href="http://en.akihabaranews.com/94622/displays/samsung-unleashes-its-uwb-wireless-full-hd-monitor-c23a750x-in-korea?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=samsung-unleashes-its-uwb-wireless-full-hd-monitor-c23a750x-in-korea">Akihabara News</a>: The Samsung C23A750X is a 23-inch UWB (Ultra Wide Band) wireless monitor with a 1920x1080 pixel format. For the C23A750X to work you'll need a computer with UWB, but if you are the lucky few that do have one all you need to do is plug the 23-inch UWB monitor in and wirelessly connect. The C23A750X will be available in Korea at around KRW590,000 (about US$540).</p>
