<p><a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2011/08/tablet-computers">The Economist</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Overall, the difference between Apple and the rest is that, with the iPad (as with the iPod and iPhone before it), Apple invented a whole new product category&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;one that seamlessly integrates the company&acirc;&euro;&trade;s own hardware with its own means of delivering applications and content. All that tablet-makers like Acer, Asustek, Lenovo, Hewlett-Packard, Research In Motion, Samsung and Toshiba did was to squeeze a netbook computer into a thinner case by dispensing with the cover, keyboard and hard-drive. That made them, at best, suppliers of niche hardware. And yet, such is the hubris, they expect customers to pay Apple prices for their half-baked offerings.</blockquote></p>
<p>But the rumored 7-inch Amazon Kindle tablet with access to movies, music, games, books, and apps is expected to be hundreds less than the iPad. The price? US$250 according to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/02/amazon-kindle-tablet/">MG Siegler</a>. Called simply the Amazon Kindle, the 7-inch display sports a capacitive touch LCD with a two-touch limitation; the iPad can handle ten at a time. With a plan to offer the $79 Amazon Prime service for free, Amazon Kindle users get the Instant Video service for one year. The Amazon Kindle tablet is expected to be the first and only fully-baked Android-based tablet available, at a discounted price, in October.</p>
