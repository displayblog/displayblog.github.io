<p><a href="http://www.auo.com/?sn=107&lang=en-US&c=10&n=1140">AU Optronics</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>AU Optronics Corp. and Japan's Sharp Corporation signed a patent cross license agreement today. Both parties have agreed to license to the other specified patents owned by each party.</blockquote></p>
<p>Good for both AUO and Sharp.</p>
<blockquote><p>Upon signing of the patent cross license agreement, AUO and Sharp will dismiss all pending legal actions that have been filed against each other.</blockquote></p>
<p>I guess they got tired of fighting. This cross license agreement should make both companies stronger.</p>
