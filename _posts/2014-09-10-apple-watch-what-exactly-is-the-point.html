<p>Ben Thompson, <a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/apple-watch-asking-saying/">Stratechery</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is why I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m worried that the lack of explanation about the Watch&acirc;&euro;&trade;s purpose wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t just a keynote oversight, but something that reflects a fundamental question about the product itself that Apple itself has yet to answer [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>What problem is the Apple Watch solving? Good question.</p>
<ul>
<li>Discreet. You need to be discreet during company meetings, dinners with family, and coffee with friends. The Apple Watch helps you be less of a jerk when you're checking your notifications.</li>
<li>Convenience. You don't need to pry out your massive smartphone (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/09/09/iphone-6-plus/">iPhone 6 Plus</a> included) from your ball-busting skinny jeans or initiate a galactic search inside your massive black hole of a purse, every time you get a notification.</li>
<li>Style. You don't have to don toy-like plastic crap around your wrist to be healthy. With the Apple Watch you can be stylish and smart.</li>
<li>Love. People will stop hating you, because you actually respond to calls, texts, and emails.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Just a few points.</p>
