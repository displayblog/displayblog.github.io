<p><a href="http://www.asymco.com/2013/04/16/escaping-pcs">Horace Dediu</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Assuming further that &acirc;&euro;&oelig;other&acirc;&euro; vendors have the same profitability ratio as the top 5 combined yields a figure of 45% &acirc;&euro;&oelig;profit capture of PC market&acirc;&euro; for Apple. This is not as good as its performance in the phone market, where Apple has about 72%, but it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not bad.</blockquote></p>
<p>Not bad.</p>
