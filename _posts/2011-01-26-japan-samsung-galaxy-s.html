<p>Japan seems to be loving the Samsung Galaxy S: it was the top phone sold in Japan from January 10th through the 16th according to Gfk Japan and reported by <a href="www.mobilecrunch.com/2011/01/26/smartphones-top-handset-sales-in-japan-galaxy-s-is-no-1/">Mobile Crunch</a>. At #2 was the 16GB iPhone 4 and at #3 was the 32GB iPhone 4. Would rankings be different if the two iPhone 4 models were categorized simply as iPhone 4?</p>
