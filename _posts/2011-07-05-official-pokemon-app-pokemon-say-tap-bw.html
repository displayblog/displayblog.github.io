<p><a href="http://kotaku.com/5818044/here-it-is-an-official-pokmon-app">Kotaku</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The app, <em>Pok&Atilde;&copy;mon Say Tap? BW</em>, uses music and on screen Pok&Atilde;&copy;mon cards in a timing game. The free app is slated to be out this summer, making it the first Pok&Atilde;&copy;mon game to appear on non-Nintendo hardware.</blockquote></p>
<p>Nintendo is clearly interested in finding out how well Pok&Atilde;&copy;mon will do on the App Store. I'm guessing it'll do <em>really</em> well and predict Pok&Atilde;&copy;mon will be the biggest reason why kids will ask their parents for an iPod touch. Sayonara Angry Birds. Next up? Microsoft's Halo and Sony's Gran Turismo.</p>
