<p>This concept is by Guilherme Martins Schasiepen (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/guilhermescha/">Flickr photostream</a>) and reported by <a href="http://macmagazine.com.br/2011/07/07/leitor-cria-novo-conceito-de-como-podera-ser-o-iphone-4s5/#leitura">MacMagazine</a>. It's a sexy-looking concept with plausible upgrades such as the FaceTime HD camera, 8-megapixel camera capable of 1080p video capture, a thinner body, etc. What I'm not sure about is the 4-inch display that pushes right up against the edges.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/06/17/rumor-edge-to-edge-display-on-iphone-5/">I have my doubts</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Grab your iPhone 4. Look closely at how your fingers hang over the display. On an edge-to-edge display that could con&Acirc;&shy;stitute a touch, a bad user experience design.</blockquote></p>
<p>And edge-to-edge display looks beautiful and it works on a device like the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/07/07/gateway-id47-packs-14-inch-lcd-into-13-3-inch-chassis/">Gateway ID47</a>. The tiny bezel allowed Gateway to integrate a 14-inch LCD into a 13.3-inch chassis. That's great. But for a touch device like the iPhone it doesn't work that well. And edge-to-edge display on an iPhone would lead to many false-positive touch actuation: you're just holding the iPhone and it thinks you touched something when you actually didn't. A lot of folks would get frustrated. I don't think Apple would go this direction.</p>
<p>For a larger 4-inch display to work the iPhone will need to get a little bigger: not taller per se, but wider. Not <em>much</em> bigger since the display itself will have thinner bezels, the top and bottom could be trimmed a little, but the iPhone chassis will probably need to be slightly wider than the current iPhone 4. That could possibly happen.</p>
