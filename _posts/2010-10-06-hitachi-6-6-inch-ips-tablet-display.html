<p><a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&ie=UTF8&langpair=ja%7Cen&sl=yi&tl=en&u=http://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/event/20101006_398208.html">Impress</a>: Hitachi's 6.6-inch IPS tablet LCD sports an amazing 1600x1200 pixel format resulting in a resolution of 302 PPI, just a little less than the industry-leading Retina Display with a 326 PPI. Of course the Retina Display has been shipping on the iPhone 4 for some time while Hitachi's 6.6-inch IPS LCD panel has no definite timeline for mass production: that really is the big difference.</p>
<p>The aspect ratio on the 6.6-inch IPS LCD by Hitachi is 4:3, which is the same as the iPad. Other specs include: 800:1 contrast ratio, 400 cd/m2 brightness.</p>
<p>Even if Apple is working on a smaller iPad there is no way Apple would allow a display supplier like Hitachi to showcase the panel. Personally, I don't think Apple is working on a 7-inch iPad, but I could be wrong.</p>
