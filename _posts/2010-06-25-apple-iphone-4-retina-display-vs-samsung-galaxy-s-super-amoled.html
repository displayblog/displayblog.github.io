<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/24/iphone-4-retina-display-vs-galaxy-s-super-amoled-fight/">Engadget</a> pitted the iPhone 4's Retina Display against the Super AMOLED-toting Galaxy S. Here's what Vlad Savov had to say regarding brightness:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Super AMOLED display on the Galaxy S remains pretty much a standard-setting screen, and yet it looked almost gray when sat next to Apple's latest (with both handsets rocking a 100 percent brightness setting).</blockquote><br />
In the sun:</p>
<blockquote><p>... it's a pretty impossible task to differentiate between the output of the Retina Display and Super AMOLED, though if we have to choose, Samsung will get the nod.</blockquote><br />
This is, of course, subjective. But it is nonetheless interesting. In <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/21/super-amoled-is-decent-in-the-sun/">Super AMOLED Is Decent In The Sun</a></em> the folks at Techblog compared the Super AMOLED-toting Galaxy S, the non-Super HTC Desire and a ho-hum LCD-featuring Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 in the sun. The result was that the regular LCD did a slightly better job in direct sunlight. Of course this is also a subjective opinion but if you watch the video the XPERIA X10 does indeed do a bit better job in the sun. If Savov's opinion is right then that implies the Retina Display is <em>worse</em> than the XPERIA X10's LCD in the sun. I find that hard to believe, but I could be wrong.</p>
<p>Pixel vs. pixel:</p>
<blockquote><p>... the Retina Display really whoops on the Super AMOLED on the pixel level. Definition still looks ridiculous on the iPhone 4, and Samsung simply can't match it there.</blockquote><br />
Keep in mind Savov thinks the color saturation on the PenTile Matrix-based Super AMOLED was "spot on". From my experience smartphones using Samsung's PenTile Matrix AMOLED panels tend not to be just a little over-saturated. Read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/02/24/display-showdown-part-ib-nexus-one/">Display Showdown Part Ib: Nexus One</a></em> for the whole story:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Nexus One has a much greater color gamut than the standard sRGB and results in over-saturated colors. It is commonly under&Acirc;&shy;stood that a wider color gamut is generally better, but it is a mis&Acirc;&shy;conception. Content is usually created with sRGB and until a wider color gamut becomes a standard, wide color gamut displays will exhibit poor color accuracy. Wider color gamut displays do not show any colors that are not in the original images and result in color distortion.</blockquote><br />
At the end poppin' colors, not color accuracy, might be your cup of tea so each to his own.</p>
