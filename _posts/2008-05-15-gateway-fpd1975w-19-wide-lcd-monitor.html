<p>I have said this a few times before but I will say it again: A <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=refurbished">refurbished</a> unit means that whatever was going to go wrong anyway has been fixed and offered up at a huge discount and is generally a great bargain in my opinion. So, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=gateway">Gateway</a>'s FPD1975W is a great bargain at just $149.99 from TigerDirect. Sure the viewing angle is nothing to write home about. LCDs with <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=tn">TN</a> technology usually gets about 160/160 but the FPD1975W is even worse than that. Other specifications are actually pretty standard. At least it has a DVI-D connection. If you're on a tight budget and upgrading from a 10-year old CRT monitor, this could be your entry into the brave new world of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-monitor">LCD monitors</a>!</p>
<p><strong>Update 2008.05.16</strong><br />
I was browsing around Amazon.com (my favorite online store) and found the FPD1975W for just $159.81, but it is a "Like New" model. It has 8 customer reviews with 6 of them giving the FPD1975W 5 stars out of 5. The reviewers seem to be mostly average folks that were upgrading from 17" 5:4 models. In general it is a pretty cool experience going from a square-like LCD to a wide one, especially when you're watching a DVD for the first time on it.</p>
