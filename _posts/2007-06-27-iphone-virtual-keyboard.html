<p>I was reading <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/06/27/new-iphone-vid-demystifies-the-keyboard/">Engadget's post</a> on the magnifying function of the iPhone to better position the cursor, or your finger, for better text input using the virtual keyboard. Have a look at the picture below:</p>

Now, look at your finger. Then, look at the keyboard buttons. Does anything look wrong? Well, I think I have found the clue as to why the virtual keyboard doesn't work as well as it should. It's pretty simple. Your finger, when pressed on the screen, looks like a circle, from a sensor point of view. The keyboard buttons are not; they are rectangular. Just because we have squarish/rectangular physical keyboards doesn't mean that they should be so on a virtual keyboard. That's where Apple got it wrong, in my humble opinion. The virtual keyboard should have <em><strong>round</strong></em> keys, just like our fingers. My bet is that with round keys, it will be much easier to type with your finger.</p>
