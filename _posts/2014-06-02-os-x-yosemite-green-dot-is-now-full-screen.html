<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/preview/design/">Apple</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Take the red, yellow, and green &acirc;&euro;&oelig;stoplights&acirc;&euro;¬ù in the corner of every app window. Not only have we streamlined their look, but we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve also updated their functions. Close, minimize, and maximize are now close, minimize, and full screen, eliminating the extra full-screen control and consolidating the window controls in one place.</blockquote></p>
<p>I hope this is not like Full Screen mode in Chrome, but more like Presentation Mode with all the chrome hidden.</p>
