  will be a total of 16 sets in the AQUOS DX line of LCD TVs from Sharp: 26\" (3),
  32\" (3), 37\" (3), 42\" (3), 46\" (2), 52\" (2). The 37\" and larger DX LCD TVs
  have 1080p capability with a pixel format of 1920 x 1080. This is perfect since
  the integrated Blu-ray recorder can pump out 1080p and record 1080p. I'm not sure
  why Sharp bothered with the 26\" and 32\" versions with a pixel format of 1366 x
  768 since they are not able to give you the full experience of Blu-ray. It is also
  interesting that Sharp didn't integrate the higher-end 1920 x 1080 32\" LCD panel
  inside the 32\" version (LC-32DX1). "

<p>I will say that I personally do not like TVs with integrated stuff. The integrated stuff always tend to break first and then you end up having to purchase a non-integrated version of the no broken integrated stuff. For instance, my father-in-law purchased a 20" CRT TV with an integrated VHS player several years ago. The VHS player is now broken. The 20" CRT TV still works quite well but with a broken VHS player. I would recommend skipping the integrated Blu-ray recorder and getting a PlayStation 3. :-) You don't want to record on Blu-ray anyway: you'll just end with a ton of Blu-ray disks and won't know which one is which. But if you really had to record HD programs... hmm, do you have any suggestions?</p>
