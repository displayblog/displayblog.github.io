<p>[ <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/12/digital-capitalism-douglas-rushkoff">The Guardian</a> ] Douglas Rushkoff:</p>
<blockquote><p>Facebook will market you your future before you&rsquo;ve even gotten there, they&rsquo;ll use predictive algorithms to figure out what&rsquo;s your likely future and then try to make that even more likely. They&rsquo;ll get better at programming you &ndash; they&rsquo;ll reduce your spontaneity. And they can use your face and name to advertise through you, that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve agreed to. I didn&rsquo;t want Facebook to advertise something through me as an influencer where my every act becomes grist to marketing.</blockquote></p>
<p>By signing up with Facebook I've agreed to let Facebook use my face and name for advertisements? That sucks.</p>
