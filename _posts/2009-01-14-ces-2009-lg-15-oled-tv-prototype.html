<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lg">LG</a> showcased its <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=15"-oled-tv">15" OLED TV</a> prototype during CES 2009. The most stunning feature about the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=15"">15"</a> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=oled">OLED</a> TV was how thin it was: just 0.85mm. That is extremely thin. Have a look at the video above to see for yourself how thin that looks. The pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1366-x-768">1366 x 768</a> is quite high considering that <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sony">Sony</a>'s <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=xel-1">XEL-1</a> at <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=11"">11"</a> sports just <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=960-x-540">960 x 540</a>. If LG decides to make this commercially available it would be the first HD OLED TV and the world's largest that you can actually buy. Also bear in mind that LG's prototype is running at 120Hz, double that of Sony's.</p>
<p>When asked about commercial production of the 15" OLED TV, I received different answers from different people. A LG representative on the show floor said that summer of 2009 would be around the time when the 15" OLED TV could enter mass production. Another said it could be available some time in 2009 and that there is the possibility that it could be in 2010. I also spoke with others that said the OLED panel is ready for mass production and is waiting for LG Electronics to give it the green light.</p>
