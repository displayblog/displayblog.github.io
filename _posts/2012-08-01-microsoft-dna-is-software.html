<blockquote><p><strong>Designing and building hardware is easy.</strong> That is, easy relative to SELLING hardware. Retail, hardware supply chain management, inventory management, support, etc&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; are huge endeavors that Microsoft has very little capability for. If you have not actually tried to build and <em>sell</em> a hardware product you cannot really understand just how challenging it is. The DNA of Microsoft is that of a software company. Zune proved this. The ZuneHD was (and is) a <strong>fantastic</strong> piece of integrated hardware & software. But Microsoft&acirc;&euro;&trade;s execution in <strong>selling</strong> it was bush league.</blockquote></p>
