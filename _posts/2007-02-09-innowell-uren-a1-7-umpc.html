<p>I am pretty sure there aren't any American folks at Innowell. The first thing that came to my mind when I saw UREN was something else entirely. Anyway, the UREN A1 is a 7" touchscreen UMPC that sports an AMD LX800 CPU and runs Windows XP. It has a SiRF III GPS module and supports HSDPA connections. Innowell has plans to offer a UREN A1 plus that includes a DMB receiver in addition to HSDPA.</p>
<p>From one of the pictures at <a href="http://aving.net/usa/news/default.asp?mode=read&amp;c_num=35469&amp;C_Code=01&amp;SP_Num=0">AVING</a>, there are four pixel formats you can choose from: 800 x 480, 800 x 600, 1024 x 600, 1024 x 768. I wouldn't pick the 4:3 aspect ratios (800 x 600, 1024 x 768) as those would distort quite a bit. But I am unsure that this 7" LCD is capable of 1024 x 600 natively. Most likely, the UREN A1 sports a 7" with a native pixel format of 800 x 480, which is pretty good.</p>
