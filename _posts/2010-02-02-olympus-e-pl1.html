Wanted to purchase an EP-1 or EP-2 but found them too expensive or too big? Olympus has solved that problem with the E-PL1, a simplified, less expensive Micro-Four Thirds digital camera. The E-PL1 features a 12.3 million effective-pixel 4/3-inch Hi-Speed Live MOS image sensor with a primary RGB color filter array and a fixed low pass filter (anti-alias filter). The price is just US$599 and is geared toward compact camera users who want better pictures but without any additional fuss. Because of the lack of any control dials those who like to take control of aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc. will need to push a lot of buttons.</p>
<p>Unlike the EP-1 or EP-2 the E-PL1 has a built-in flash and a revised TruePix V image processor tuned for the lighter low-pass/anti-aliasing filter. Like the EP-2 the E-PL1 sports the EVF/accessory port under the flash hot-shoe. The E-PL1 can record 720/30p video for 7 minutes in Motion JPEG format via a dedicated movie button in red. The microphone is mono (unlike the EP-1/2). Interestingly the E-PL1 is taller and thicker than the E-P2 and Panasonic's DMC-GF1. It also weighs more than the GF1 but a bit less than the E-P2. At $599 the E-PL1 lowers the cost of entry to a Micro-Four Thirds digital camera while keeping the essentials of what makes this mirror-less system unique: relative compactness and near DSLR-like performance.
