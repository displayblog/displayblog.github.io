<p>Samsung's CX305T sports a resolution of 2560 x 1600 (just like the 30" models from Apple and Dell). Specifications include a contrast ratio of 1000:1 and a response time of 6ms (making it the fastest of the bunch). The design is simple and black with height adjustment.</p>

<p>Having a large monitor like the CX305T with lots and lots of pixels is simply wonderful, I think. I don't have one, yet, but imagine the possibilities of having 2560 x 1600 pixels to do whatever you want. A split-window view would give you two windows with 1280 x 1600 each. Nice.</p>
