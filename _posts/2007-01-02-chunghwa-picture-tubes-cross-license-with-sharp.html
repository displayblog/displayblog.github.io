<p>Chunghwa Picture Tubes (CPT) and Sharp announced on December 27, 2006, that they have cross-licensed LCD patents. The duration of the license is from July 2006 to June 2011, 5 years.</p>
<p>The new agreement will replace an existing cross-licensing agreement that expired at the end of 2006. The agreement covers certain patents for LCD monitor, notebook PC and LCD TVs. Sharp and CPT have had a cross-licensing deal related to certain LCD patents since 2002.</p>
<p>This is an interesting move for Sharp. I would guess that Sharp has many more patents relevant to LCD technology and manufacturing. Maybe CPT has cathode ray tube (CRT) technology patents that can be applied toward LCD or some other display technology. Who knows, but the winner seems to be CPT in this case.</p>
