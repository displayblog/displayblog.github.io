<p>Sharp's B20 HD 1080p Slimline series LCD TVs are very thin at just 3.7". But is that really thin? I've seen Hitachi tout its 1.5" PDP TVs! But maybe that's not what Sharp is talking about when saying that the design is Slimline. I think Sharp is talking about the bezel thickness. There is no way to accurately measure the bezel thickness from a picture, but it seems to be pretty slim. Yawn.</p>
<p>But there are more exciting features. For instance, the 42" LC42B20E sports a 4ms response time, which is pretty fast. All three sizes feature a contrast ratio of 2,000:1 with dynamic contrast ratio hitting 10,000:1. That should get some good images up on the B20s.</p>
