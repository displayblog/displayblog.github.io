<p><a href="http://www.cbw.cz/phprs/2006091808.html">Czech Business Weekly</a>: On September 11, 2006, Toshiba entered into discussions with the Polish government regarding the construction of a LCD TV assembly plant in Kobierzyce, a suburb of Wroclaw, Poland. LG Electronics (LGE), LG.Philips LCD (LPL), and IPS Alpha are already in Wroclaw.</p>
<p>Toshiba is targeting mid-2008 for operations to commence at the plant. The LCD TV assembly plant will have an annual production capacity of 1.5 - 2 million 32&acirc;&euro;&sup3; or larger LCD TVs. The investment amount will be around EURO 34 million, but the exact amount has yet been determined. Toshiba will procure LCD panels from LPL that is currently under construction in Wroclaw. LPL&acirc;&euro;&trade;s factory will be operational in March 2007 with an initial capacity of 3 million LCD modules per year and increasing to 11 million by 2011. Additional panels will be sourced from IPS Alpha, who is setting upt a plant in the Czech Republic.</p>
