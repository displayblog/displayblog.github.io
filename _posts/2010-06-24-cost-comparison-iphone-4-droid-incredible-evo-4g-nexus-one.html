<p>An excellent infographic from BillShrink.com <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/gadgetlab/2010/06/iphone4-evo4g-incredible.jpg">Wired</a> comparing the iPhone 4, Droid Incredible, EVO 4G and Nexus One: the per-phone cost, a few key specs, and total costs for minimum and unlimited plans. Interestingly the iPhone 4G with the minimum plan costs the least over 24 months and the Droid Incredible on Verizon costs the most. If you want to go unlimited the cheapest will be the Nexus One on T-Mobile with the Droid Incredible on Verizon costing the most. The iPhone 4 on AT&amp;T costing the least? <em>Surprising!</em></p>
