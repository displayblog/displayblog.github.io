<p>ByD:sign / EyeFi introduces their LF-4200DFK and LF-4700DFK. As the model names suggest the LF-4200DFK is a 42" LCD TV and the LF-4700DFK is a 47" version. Both are able to show Full HD 1080p content with a pixel format of 1920 x 1080. <a href="http://www.watch.impress.co.jp/av/docs/20070305/bydsign.htm">Impress</a> (Japanese), via <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/03/05/byd-sign-eyefi-cheapo-42-and-47-inch-1080p-lcds/">Engadget</a>, is stating the LCD TV panel supplier to be Chi Mei Optoelectronics (CMO). The LCD features a 1200:1 contrast ratio and a brightness of 500 cd/m2. The 47" has a slightly faster response time (6.0ms) compared to the 42" (6.5ms). Both response times are respectably fast, however, it is not response times alone that reduce motion blur problems.</p>

<p>On the TV electronics side, both TVs have a Faroudja DCDi scaler, integrated analog and digital tuners, HDMI, VGA (D-Sub 15) with composite and S-Video too. The price for Full HD 1080p capability is quite affordable at around $1900 for the LF-4200DFK and about $2300 for the LF-4700DFK. The identical design for both is very simple and all black, which is a combination that I appreciate.</p>
<p>Both TVs are billed as one of the cheapest Full HD 1080p HD sets so it is unreasonable to expect 120Hz, blinking or dimming backlights, and improved color gamuts via LEDs or Wide Color Gamut (WCG) CCFLs. But, these features have become essential for optimum viewing of fast motion video, especially those who are looking for Full HD 1080p sets.</p>
