<p><a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2147011/this-is-tim-apples-ceo-on-the-ipad-apple-tv-future-products-and-china.html">Macworld</a>: Tim Cook, during CYQ1'14 earnings call regarding the iPad:</p>
<blockquote><p>And so, when I back up from all of these, I feel great. That doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t mean that every quarter, every 90 days is going to be a number that everybody is thrilled with. But what it means to me is that the trend over the arc of time that things look very, very good, that iPad has a great future. And of course the thing that drives us more than any of this are the next iPads if you will, the things that are in the pipeline, the things that we can do to make the product even better and there is no shortage of work going in on that nor any shortage of ideas.</blockquote></p>
<p>Looking forward to &acirc;&euro;&oelig;the next iPads&acirc;&euro;¬ù.</p>
