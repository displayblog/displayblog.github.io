<p><a href="http://www.viewsonic.com/products/lcd-tvs/vt2430.htm">ViewSonic</a>, <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20081215005278&amp;newsLang=en">BusinessWire</a> via <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/12/15/viewsonic-introduces-24-inch-1080p-vt2430-lcd-tv/">Engadget</a>: On December 15, 2008, ViewSonic announced its VT2430 LCD TV. It's a 24" LCD TV sporting a 1920x1080 pixel format. This is an interesting development as most LCD TVs this size tend to be 23" and feature a pixel format of 1366x768. On the other hand most LCD monitors that are 24" in size feature a 1920x1200 pixel format. 24" LCD monitors are starting to slowly shift toward a 16:9 aspect ratio from 1920x1200 to 1920x1080. So what I am guessing is that ViewSonic used a 16:9 24" LCD monitor panel, slapped on a tuner and called it a day: the VT2430 was born. This isn't anything new.</p>
<p>Samsung has been successfully selling its T240HD. Samsung calls it a "HDTV widescreen monitor". The T240HD is a 24" LCD TV that sports a 16:9 24" LCD monitor panel of the TN variety. ViewSonic is doing the same thing here with the VT2430. A TN LCD is a lot cheaper to manufacture, has relatively fast response times but has slightly limited viewing angles. The 1920 x 1080 pixel format is great but there are some areas that lack: 250 cd/m2 is sub-standard for a LCD TV but bright enough for a LCD monitor. The built-in ATSC tuner is required to be called a TV but there is only one HDMI port. So if you're thinking of using the VT2430 as a TV, say in your bedroom and want to hook up your cable TV and a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=ps3">PS3</a>, you'll need to figure out which one gets lone the digital connection. I think ViewSonic is targetting those who are thinking of using the VT2430 as your <em>monitor</em> and have the ability to watch some HD (you'll need to pull some cable cable to your home office). It's a pretty good price with a MSRP of just US$399.</p>
