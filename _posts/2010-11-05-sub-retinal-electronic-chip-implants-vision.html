<p><a href="http://www.medgadget.com/archives/2010/11/retinal_implant_successful_in_bringing_vision_to_blind.html">Medgadget</a>: Reutlingen, Germany based Retina Implant AG has conducted clinical studies with three blind patients. The company's subretinal electronic chip is 3mm in diameter, 50&Icirc;&frac14;m thick and packs 1520 microphotodiodes in a 38x40 array with each pixel measuring 70x70&Icirc;&frac14;m. </p>
<blockquote><p>All three reported varying levels of vision and one of the subjects was even able to discern common objects like knives and forks laying on the table.</blockquote></p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
