<p><a href="http://www.akihabaranews.com/en/news-15950-3+New+digital+picture+frames+from+Kenko.html">Akihabara News</a>: Kenko is a popular Japanese manufacturer of digital camera accessories. On May 5 (Japan time), Kenko announced its KDF-07 series of digital photo frames. There are three frames you can choose from: black, aluminum, and wood. I must say that the bezels are too thick and the tapered look also goes against modern design. Looking at the picture, it seems there is a remote control placeholder, which is clever. I wish TVs had one of these. By the way, do the Japanese use a lot of digital photo frames?</p>
