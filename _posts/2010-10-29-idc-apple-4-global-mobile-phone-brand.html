<blockquote><p>Apple leapt ahead of several vendors in 3Q10 including RIM, which it surpassed by 1.7-million units, and Sony Ericsson by 3.7-million units. The company's record shipment performance can be attributed to the introduction of the iPhone 4 in 17 new countries last quarter.</blockquote></p>
<p>The top dogs are Nokia (110.4 million), Samsung (71.4) and LG Electronics (28.4).</p>
