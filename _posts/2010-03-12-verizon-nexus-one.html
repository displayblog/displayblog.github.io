<p>Verizon's Nexus One is HTC's Incredible and sports the Sense UI. And you'll only be able to purchase it through Google's store. Big mistake. I would much rather be able to go to a Verizon store and pick up the CDMA version of the Nexus One. It is also a whole lot easier to go to a physical store and interact with a physical customer representative when something goes wrong.
