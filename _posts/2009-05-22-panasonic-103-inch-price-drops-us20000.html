  dropped the price of its <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250:8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID:11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=103&amp;sa=Search\">103</a>-inch
  by US$20,000 to US$50,000. The 103-inch plasma display is the world's largest commercially
  available since December 2006. Since its debut, more than 6,000 103-inch plasma
  displays have been installed worldwide. According to Andrew Nelkin, president of
  Panasonic Professional Display Company:\r\n<blockquote>The combination of advancements
  in Plasma production technology and the tremendous worldwide success of the Panasonic
  103-inch Plasma HD Display over the last two plus years have enabled us to increase
  production as well as efficiencies, and thereby make it available to a wider range
  of customers at a lower price point. When our 103-inch Plasma first debuted, it
  was a made-to-order product. It soon became obvious that in ultra-large screen sizes,
  nothing comes close to the Panasonic 103-inch Plasma in delivering crisp, clear,
  blur-free images in 1080p High Definition. Demand for the 103 exceeded our initial
  expectations, and its popularity continues.</blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:
