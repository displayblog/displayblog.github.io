<p>Walk into a Verizon Wireless store and you'll need to pay $300 plus tax to walk out with a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=motorola+droid&amp;sa=Search#1363">Motorola DROID</a> smartphone. You'll only pay $200 plus tax if you walk into a Best Buy store. But if you want to pay even less, <a href="http://searswireless.com/template/simpleautocontent.aspx?pageid=6414&amp;r=sears&amp;refcode1=SRS_1106_001_HP-VzwDroid&amp;sid=I0084400010000100600&amp;aff=Y&amp;origin=prod">go to Sears</a> and you only have to pay $150 plus tax. I don't know if you can walk in, but the online store gives you free shipping via FedEx. So if you can wait a bit and want to save $50, Sears seems to be the best bet as of now.</p>
