<p>I was in San Francisco today for Samsung's GREENnovation media luncheon at the Sheraton Palace Hotel. I got there just in time to listen to Scott Birnbaum, VP of Samsung's LCD Business, present "LCDs: Low-power Performance Across a High-powered Landscape". Although the presentation centered around LCDs there were some nuggets about OLED power consumption:</p>
<ul>
<li>Samsung's AMOLED consumes 65% less power than typical LCDs</li>
<li>The Super version of its AMOLED consumes 20% less than regular AMOLEDs</li><br />
</ul><br />
I wasn't sure whether or not these claims were true so I asked Dr. Raymond Soneira, President of DisplayMate Technologies, <em>via</em> email. And here's his response:</p>
<blockquote><p>I measured the AC power consumed by the phones for different luminance levels on the display, and published my results in a table. Note that I normalized my results to a given luminance and a given screen area so that I compared their relative efficiencies. The Galaxy S had significantly lower luminance than the LCDs but it's important to compare the power consumed for equal luminance levels.</p>
<p>I was surprised at how much power the OLEDs used and how little the iPhone 4 used. I confirm in the article that the Super OLEDs use 20% less power than the non-super OLEDs.</p>
<p>If OLEDs consume 65% less power than LCDs that means they only use 35% of the power of an LCD - i.e. LCDs consume 3 times as much power as OLEDs... and then Super OLEDs are 20 percent better that... No way!!</p>
<p>Maybe that could be true at the device level, but in a complete display there are several layers between the device and the outside world, where the viewer and measuring instruments are. In particular the Galaxy S appears to have a strong absorbing layer used to reduce its screen reflectance, which then also cuts down on the visible light from the OLEDs - and that directly cuts the true observed power efficiency.</blockquote></p>
<p>The bottom line: the possibility that Samsung's AMOLED display consumes 65% less power than LCDs is very low. There is a small chance that Samsung Mobile Display's AMOLED might consume 65% less power than the very worst mobile LCD, but in general AMOLEDs consume <em>more</em> power than LCDs. However it is true that SMD's Super AMOLED consumes 20% less than the regular version. The article that Dr. Soneira is referring to is the <a href="http://www.displaymate.com/Smartphone_ShootOut_1.htm">Smartphone "Super" LCD-OLED Display Technology Shoot-Out</a>.</p>
