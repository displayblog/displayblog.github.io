<p>According to Tech Digest's Katherine Hannaford, Toshiba held a press launch in Paris on the morning of May 7 and unveiled the company's pearl white Portege M800. The M800 follows the path of using a 13.3" LCD to focus on consumers who want a great design and portability. The M800 will be a limited edition.</p>
<p>An interesting feature of the M800 is that the touchpad has lights, white LEDs to be precise. I'm not sure if this is necessary since users probably will not require the assistance of light to get to the touchpad. The keyboard, on the other hand, does require a LED backlight because there are so many keys and not everyone knows exactly where all the keys are especially the notebook PC model-specific function keys and other special keys. And one more thing: even though LEDs consume little power they do consumer power and with the additional lighting on the touchpad, I wonder if overall battery life will suffer because of it; probably just a tiny bit.</p>
