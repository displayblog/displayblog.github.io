<p><a href="http://www.itechnews.net/2007/01/16/fujitsu-fmv-biblo-loox-t-series-laptops-t70u-t50uv-t50u/">iTech News Net</a>: The Fujitsu FMV-BIBLO LOOX T series T70U might have a rather unusual name, but it is in direct competition with Sony's TR series notebook PCs that also sport the same 10.6" wide TFT LCD with a pixel format of 1280x768. The unit looks to be fairly light, which is also the type of workload that it will be able to muster. The T70U is powered by a 1.2GHz Intel Core Solo U1400, not exactly powerful, but will get you through email, Internet surfing and not-too-heavy Office work.</p>
