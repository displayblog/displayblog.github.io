<p>Sharp's Lynx SH-10B runs on NTT DoCoMo and is powered by Android. The touch-enabled 5-inch display sports a 960x480 pixel format and is coupled with a QWERTY keyboard in a clamshell form factor, like a MID but is actually a smartphone. Unfortunately the Android version seems to be 1.6 so the entire UI was laggy according to <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/06/sharp-lynx-sh-10b-is-a-middling-android-smartphone-we-could-get/">Engadget</a>.</p>
<p>For folks who:</p>
<ul>
<li>Need to write a lot</li>
<li>Would rather not use his/her thumbs</li>
<li>Would rather not lug around an external Bluetooth keyboard</li>
<li>Who don't mind a little bulk</li><br />
</ul><br />
the Lynx SH-10B from Sharp might be just the right ticket.</p>
