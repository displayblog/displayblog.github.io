<p>Siu Han at <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20110712PD212.html">DigiTimes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sales of TVs in the China market were originally projected to grow 15% to over 42 million units in 2011, but the projected growth has been lowered to 10% recently and sales during the upcoming National Day holidays in October will be the key to see if total sales for the year will be able to reach over 40 million units, the sources noted.</blockquote></p>
<p>For the first time, more TVs were sold in rural China than tier-1 cities in fourth quarter 2010. Chinese TV brands will refocus on rural areas for TV sales growth in 2011 with lower-end TV models.</p>
