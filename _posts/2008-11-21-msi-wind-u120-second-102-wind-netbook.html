<p><a href="http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2008/11/msi-unleashes-s.html">Wired</a>: The MSI Wind U120 will be hitting retail store shelves in mid-December. The U120 sports a 10.2" wide TFT LCD with a pixel format of 1024x600, which is the same thing that was on the U100.</p>
<p>Everything is the same except for a bigger HDD (80GB vs. 160GB) and the option of adding 3.5G connectivity. Externally, the U120 comes in white with black accents and is a bit more angular than the U100.</p>
