Not a good sign. Take a good look at the bottom right corner and you can see a slight brownish yellowish discoloration on the LCD. Some forum members on <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2010/06/23/some-iphone-4s-experiencing-display-discoloration/">MacRumors</a> are reporting brownish or yellowish discoloration on the iPhone 4 LCD. The same problem is being reported on <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=11739423">Apple's discussion forums</a> (the second one <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=11737139&amp;#11737139">here</a>). It seems Apple is willing to replace the iPhone 4 for another one, but replacement iPhone 4 units seem to be either severely limited or none at all. I wonder what is going on with these spots... I've seen similar spots on very old IPS displays but they were usually the result of prolonged exposure to the heat coming out of driver ICs. The photo above is from user <em>elitemrp</em> in Apple's discussions forum titled "<a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=11739423#11739423">Flawed Screen</a>".</p>
