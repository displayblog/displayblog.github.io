<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/NewsShow/NewsSearch.asp?DocID=PB000000000000000000000000005195&query=APPLE">DigiTimes</a> &rarr; <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2010/11/26/next-ipad-to-add-five-new-features-including-usb-port/">MacRumors</a>: The next iPad or iPad 2.0 will be coming to us in 2011, I think and so does everyone else. Wouldn't it be nice to know what the iPad 2.0 will be like. Well, the rumor has it that it will have these features:</p>
<ul>
<li>FaceTime: At least a front-facing camera for FaceTime.</li>
<li>Better Mobility: Lighter and thinner perhaps, thanks to carbon fiber or LiquidMetal.</li>
<li>USB Port: I'm not buying this.</li>
<li>New Display Technology: Well, not new since it'll be LCD, the IPS kind. Steve Jobs will claim the iPad has a Retina Display with a 2048x1536 pixel format.</li>
<li>Gyroscope: A 3-axis one. For game-playing perhaps?</li><br />
</ul><br />
There is also the possibility that the 3G version of the iPad 2.0 might be carrier-agnostic and play nice with both GSM and CDMA.</p>
