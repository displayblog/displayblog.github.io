<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5851" style="margin-right: 5px;" title="samsung_alias_2_keypad_portrait" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/samsung_alias_2_keypad_portrait.jpg" alt="samsung_alias_2_keypad_portrait" width="264" height="238" />There is not a single nice picture of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=samsung&amp;sa=Search#1673">Samsung</a>'s Alias 2. But here you can see the keypad in a couple of portrait modes. You can see several pictures of the ugly Alias 2 on PhoneArena (link at the bottom) if you really want to.</p>
<p><strong>E Ink </strong>Samsung's Alias 2 is a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=smartphone&amp;sa=Search#1486">smartphone</a> with a smart keyboard. The QWERTY keyboard sports <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=e+ink&amp;sa=Search#1516">E Ink</a> technology. E Ink is used in Amazon's super-popular <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=kindle&amp;sa=Search#1411">Kindle</a> as well as almost all other ebook readers. What E Ink technology allows the Alias 2 do is shape shift--well, not really, but it sounded good. The QWERTY keyboard layout changes depending on whether you're texting or just using the Alias 2 like a normal phone. You see, the Alias 2's LCD can be flipped sideways or flipped up thanks to the dual-hinge design: sideways for texting and up for regular phoning. Sounds cool to me. But I wonder if the buttons are programmable and what they feel like: the buttons look like they are part physical button part display.</p>
<p><strong>Ugly</strong> The overall design of the Alias 2 is ho-hum. The external display looks positively ugly--what's with that slim green color? The 2.6" TFT LCD sporting a 320 x 240 pixel format should look pretty good but it's encased in a funky-looking design. Maybe the ugly look is required due to the dual-hinge--probably not. The Alias 2 is expected to hit Verizon stores on May 11.</p>
<p><strong>Idea!</strong> Wouldn't it be cool if someone came out with a full-blown E Ink keyboard?</p>
