<p>Samsung's SPH-P9000 Deluxe MIT is a unique UMPC that opens up to reveal a pretty large QWERT keyboard. Another unique feature of the SPH-P9000 is the Mobile WiMax capability. Although Engadget was able to test it's WiMax capability, whether it was the network or the prototype, connection was dialup-slow.</p>

<p>The SPH-P9000 also has CDMA EV-DO connectivity, which can be used simultaneously with its Mobile WiMax connection. The unit can playback MP3 and VOD files on its 800 x 480 pixel format 5" display. There is also a 30GB hard disk integrated and weighs slightly over 1lbs. The SPH-P9000 will be launched in Korea during the first half of 2007.</p>
