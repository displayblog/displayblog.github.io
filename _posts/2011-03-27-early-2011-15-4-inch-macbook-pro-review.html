<blockquote><p>The Samsung display, model number LTN154MT07, has an LED-backlight and is the same one as used in the current MacBook Pro's predecessor from 2010.  This has been confirmed by some users of the glossy-screen model.  The maximum screen brightness of 302 cd/m&Acirc;&sup2; and average of 288 cd/m&Acirc;&sup2; make this display rank in among the best of them.  In terms of sharpness, color crispness and contrast, the picture appears excellent, by no means worse than the glossy version.</blockquote></p>
<p>Excellent, but like almost all LCDs used in notebooks, viewing angles on the LTN154MT07 need to be improved. I've been holding my breath a good long time for an IPS equipped MacBook. I hope it's coming soon.</p>
