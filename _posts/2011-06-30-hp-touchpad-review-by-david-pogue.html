<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/30/technology/personaltech/30pogueAA.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all">David Pogue</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It supposedly has a blazing-fast chip inside, but you wouldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t know it. When you rotate the screen, it takes the screen two seconds to match &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; an eternity in tablet time. Apps can take a long time to open; the built-in chat app, for example, takes seven seconds to appear. Animations are sometimes jerky, reactions to your finger swipes sometimes uncertain.</blockquote></p>
<p>This is a recurring theme. Both <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/06/30/hp-touchpad-review-by-joshua-topolsky/">Joshua Topolsky</a> and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/06/30/hp-touchpad-review-by-jason-snell/">Jason Snell</a> have experienced this unpredictable responsiveness.</p>
<p>Pogue's conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p>In this 1.0 incarnation, the TouchPad doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t come close to being as complete or mature as the iPad or the best Android tablets; you&acirc;&euro;&trade;d be shortchanging yourself by buying one right now, unless you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re some kind of rabid A.B.A. nut (Anything but Apple).</blockquote></p>
