<p>Gizmodo did a decent piece on <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=iphone">iPhone</a> clones. They put together four iPhone clones and figured out which was best. Here is the list:</p>
<p>$129.99 <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=samsung">Samsung</a> Instinct on Sprint<br />
$199.99 <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lg">LG</a> Vu on AT&amp;T<br />
$199.99 LG Voyager on Verizon<br />
$199.99 Samsung Glyde on Verizon</p>
<p>I won't go through everything that was detailed, but the bottom line is that all four provide a terrible, just terrible, browsing experience. Great mobile browsing is not option on 3G-enabled smartphones. IT IS A MUST. </p>
<p>Samsung's Instinct was the only one of the four with visual voicemail, which was up until now a unique feature to the iPhone. The Instinct also has great GPS navigation. </p>
<p>The LG Vu on AT&amp;T came in at second, but there is no GPS and the email client was terrible.  LG Vu gets props for having the best touchscreen and related to that a great virtual keyboard, with very good responsiveness but the UI wasn't the best.</p>
<p>How about the LG Voyager and Samsung Glyde? Not close to contending.</p>
<p>Although Gizmodo touts Samsung's Instinct on Sprint to be the best iPhone clone, why not just pay $70 more to get the real deal? An additional $70 spread across a year or two comes down to just $5.83/mo more for 1 year and just $2.92/mo more for 2 years. And here's another thing you should consider: How long is Sprint going to last? That is something to think about.</p>
<p>I will admit, I do like Apple products in general, but the iPhone 3G has a lot of intelligence built into it and will most likely continue to have the best mobile browsing experience on a smartphone, the best UI, the best music UI, and on it goes.</p>
