<p><strong>Apple MacBook</strong></p>
<p>Display Size: 13.3"<br />
Pixel Format: 1280 x 768 or 1280 x 800<br />
Availability: 2H'06<br />
Price: $999</p>
<p>Many rumors abound regarding Apple's MacBook. This entry will focus on the display. It is pretty certain that the MacBook (non-Pro) will use a 13.3" LCD in widescreen format. The resolution? Most likely in the 1280 x 768 - 1280 x 800 range with roughly 250nits of brightness. There might be a prototype in the works to show off soon, but mass production will have to wait until the second half of 2006. You see, without the display, a notebook PC is nothing and that goes for the MacBook too. 13.3" wide will probably be supplied by a handful of LCD manufacturers such as Samsung, LG.Philips LCD, AUO and CMO. Mass production of their 13.3" wide will not start until the end of the second quarter, at least, according to some sources. Apple has said that it would be one of the most affordable iBooks (now MacBook) and if that's the case, I'm guessing it'll be $998, $1 cheaper than the previous iBook G4 12".</p>
