<p align="center">Acer AL2216W Specifications</p>
<p></p>
<p align="center">Size: 22"<br />Aspect Ratio: 16:10<br />Pixel Format: 1680x1050<br />Response Time: 5ms (GTG)<br />Contrast Ratio: 700:1<br />Brightness: 300 cd/m2<br />Viewing Angle: 170/160<br />Input: DVI with HDCP, VGA</p></p>
<p><a href="http://theacerblog.is-there.net/acer-al2216w-22-inch-value-line-lcd-monitor/">The Acer Blog</a>: The AL2216W is part of Acer's Value Line, meaning very affordable line, though pricing for this unit has not been announced yet. The AL2216W has a 1680x1050 resolution with a 5ms response time. Contrast ratio is 700:1 with VGA and DVI inputs.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about this announcement by Acer is that another model will be replacing this one in the fourth quarter this year that has HDCP. However, I wonder what the use for HDCP over DVI would be for a monitor that only has 1680x1050 resolution. 720p content will have to be upscaled and 1080p content will need to be downscaled: either way, this is not the resolution you want to play your PS3, XBox 360, Blu-Ray or HD-DVD on. Scaled video, no matter how good, is still scaled and nothing beats a display with 1920x1080 native resolution.</p>
<p><em>Update 2007.07.10:</em> The Acer AL2216W has been very popular among blog readers, so I wanted to update the post with some pricing information that I recently found. I like to use both PriceGrabber and ShopZilla, but prefer PriceGrabber because I don't like the new browser windows/tabs that ShopZilla pops up for every single click. According to PriceGrabber, the lowest price as of July 10 was at <a href="http://www.securemart.com/cgi-bin/future/ACB28426.html?pcode=1">SecureMart for $213.87</a>. But, since I wouldn't buy an important piece of hardware from just any store, the cheapest 4-start and higher store was <a href="http://http://www.techonweb.com/products/productdetail.aspx?id=C89067&amp;src=PG">TechOnWeb for $226.99</a>. This is, of course, before taxes and shipping. Please let me know if you know are aware of somewhere cheaper.</p>
