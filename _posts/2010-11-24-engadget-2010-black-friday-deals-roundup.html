<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/black-friday/2010/">Engadget</a> is compiling a "ultimate mega edition" that rounds up all the Black Friday deals and will be updating it regularly. So make sure to bookmark the link if you want to be up-to-date on the greatest deals.</p>
<p>Just to give you an idea: Newegg is selling a Samsung 46-inch 3D 1080p LED backlit LCD TV and the BD-C5900 3D Blu-ray player plus a Shrek 3D Starter Kit for just US$1520. Use coupon code EMCZZNN54. Too expensive?</p>
<p>How about Amazon's last generation Kindle 2 for just $89.99? This sale starts at 9am Pacific on Friday. Use the Amazon link in the footer and I'll get a small kickback. Thanks!</p>
