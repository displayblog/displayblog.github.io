<p><a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/01/04/the-e-reader-as-we-know-it-is-doomed/">Matt Alexander at The Loop</a> thinks e-readers are doomed. <a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/01/04/the-ereader-as-we-know-it-is-doomed">Marco Arment</a> disagrees:</p>
<blockquote><p>[...] the <a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/12/02/kindle-touch-vs-nook-simple-touch-kobo-touch-kindle-4">best e-reader</a> on the market today costs $79, weighs less than a third as much as an iPad 2, and has a battery that lasts a month. That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a <em>huge</em> gap that won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be filled with incremental hardware improvements.</blockquote></p>
<p>Porsche purists were dumbfounded when the company announced the Cayenne, a SUV. Then they were flabbergasted with the Panamera, a four-door sedan. These two adulterated vehicles ended up being big sellers. Good for Porsche. When I ask the question, "In one sentence, what does Porsche stand for?" all I had to do before was point at the 911. Now, I have no idea. And from what I can tell there are far better SUVs and four-door sedans out there.</p>
<p>Similarly, E Ink display technology is moving toward color. Once color is introduced as a competitive spec, E Ink will find itself face to face with two superstar display technologies: LCD and OLED. And at that point E Ink is doomed.</p>
