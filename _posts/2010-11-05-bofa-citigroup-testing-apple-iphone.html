<p><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-11-05/bank-of-america-citigroup-said-to-test-apple-iphone.html">Bloomberg Businessweek</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. are considering whether to let employees use the Apple Inc. phone as an alternative to Research In Motion Ltd.&acirc;&euro;&trade;s BlackBerry for corporate e-mail, said three people familiar with the plans. The banks are testing software for the iPhone that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s designed to make it secure enough for company messages, said the people, who didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t want to be named because the plans aren&acirc;&euro;&trade;t public.</blockquote></p>
<p>BlackBerries seem to be on the way out.</p>
