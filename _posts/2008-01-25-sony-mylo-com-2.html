<p>Sony has updated its mylo Personal Communicator to COM-2. The device has many merits. It looks better, the keyboard is backlit (now you can use it in the dark), and the LCD got a lot bigger with a lot more pixels to look at.</p>
<p>One of the best features of the mylo (previous generation included), in my opinion, is Skype via WiFi. Wherever you have a WiFi connection, you can make free phone calls to other Skype users and for a very cheap price make calls to anyone. I have a Skype Pro account that lets me call anyone anywhere for a very reasonable price, from my Skype phone and my computer. This might not be such a big deal to many, but for me, it is. I have an iPhone but I cannot communicate via voice when I travel to Korea. That's because Korea does not have a GSM network. And even if it did, since I kept my iPhone locked, the existence of a GSM network would just mean extremely high-priced phone calls allowed by AT&amp;T. With something like a mylo, that limitation no longer applies as long as I can find WiFi hotspots there. Speaking of WiFi hotspots, you get free access to <a href="http://wayport.know-where.com/wayport/">Wayport hotspots</a> (McDonald's, IHOP, Hertz, some hotels, etc.) until the end of 2009, which I think is a great deal.</p>
<p>Another cool feature is the 1.3 megapixel camera, which should be adequate enough for taking quick snaps. I believe the <a href="http://displayblog.wordpress.com/2006/08/09/sony-mylo-com-1b-w-personal-communicator/">original mylo</a> did not have a camera. In terms of the display, the COM-2 has got it right. It is a 3.5" TFT LCD that has a pixel format of 800 x 480! This is much higher density than the iPhone, which is limited to 480 x 320 pixels with the same size, 3.5". Nokia's N810 Internet Tablet also has a pixel format of 800 x 480 but with a larger sized <a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/hardware/nokia-n810-review.ars">LCD at 4.13"</a>. I expect browsing the Internet will be quite a bit improved from the original 320 x 240 screen. I'm looking forward to actually playing around with the mylo COM-2 at my local Fry's Electronics soon.</p>
