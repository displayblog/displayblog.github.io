<p><a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/personal-technology/2014/03/18/motorolas-moto-360-android-wear-smartwatch-the-details-you-want/">Wall Street Journal</a>: Joanna Stern had a chat with Lior Ron, VP of Product Management and Wearables Lead at Motorola about whether or not Moto 360 is real. Here's Ron's response:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is a very real product. I am wearing it on my hand as we speak and have been using it for the last few weeks. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s very, very real, I promise. I am touching it right now.</blockquote></p>
<p>I guess it's real. And about that circular display:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was a challenge to design. All the components have to be put in a round form factor so we used very unique materials and internals.</p>
<p>We aren&acirc;&euro;&trade;t sharing yet the screen size or resolution, but we thought through the size very carefully. We ended up with a size that is very comfortable. We took a hard look at materials that will convey the sense of quality. We have used metals and we are going to have metal and leather straps available.</blockquote></p>
<p>Here's a bit more about how Motorola came to decide Moto 360 should be circular. From <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/19/5524746/the-story-of-motorola-moto-360-from-its-designer-jim-wicks">The Verge</a>'s David Pierce and Motorola's design chief Jim Wicks chat:</p>
<blockquote><p>After two rounds of designs, prototypes, and tepid internal reactions, Motorola went back to the basics. Rather than reinvent wristwear or build a blocky rectangle like the Galaxy Gear or the Pebble Steel, Motorola decided to mimic what it hoped to replace: the elegant watches we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve had on our wrists for decades. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;We came to the realization that if we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re going to do this, we need to really embrace what this space is all about,&acirc;&euro; he says. So Motorola turned the Moto 360 into a beautiful, circular stainless-steel wearable that looks more like a Timex than a Moto X. Wicks says it got the same reaction from all the industry experts he showed it to: &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Yep, that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a watch.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>The round face is definitely a classic design, though that doesn't preclude the body from being a square. One of my favorite watch design is the <a href="http://www.bellross.com/ww/collections/aviation/br_01/#/1/">Bell & Ross BR 01-92</a>.</p>
