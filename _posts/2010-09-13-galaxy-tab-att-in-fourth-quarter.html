<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/13/exclusive-galaxy-tab-red-white-blackberry-torch-and-samsung/">Engadget</a> has received a genuine-looking photo of Samsung's Galaxy Tab with AT&T's logo on it. There is certainly the possibility that it is a nice Photoshop job. I wonder how AT&T will market Samsung's Galaxy Tab alongside Apple's iPad. If the rumor is correct the Galaxy Tab will be available on AT&T before December.</p>
