<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/4/6103209/htc-desire-820-launch-ifa-2014">The Verge</a>: The HTC Desire 820 features a 5.5-inch display but the pixel format is limited to just 1280x720 (267 ppi). Like a few other smartphones manufacturers, HTC focused on making selfies better with the Desire 820 tacking on an 8MP front-facing camera.</p>
<p>Sure that's a lot more pixels in the image sensor, but we all know megapixel count on image sensors doesn't necessarily mean better quality photos. Nice photos are captured by a good camera and need to be displayed on a quality screen to be enjoyed. How good would those photos look on a pixelated 1280x720 5.5-inch display?</p>
