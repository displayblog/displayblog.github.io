<p>On August 31, Sharp announced Full HD AQUOS LCD TVs with panels made from its G8 Kameyama Plant No. 2. The worldwide launch of these models will be on October 1, 2006. Sharp's Kameyama Plant No. 2 is the world's first G8 TFT LCD fab that works with glass substrates with dimensions 2160 x 2460 mm. The Full HD AQUOS LCD TVs will have 1920 x 1080 resolution. Sharp will currently establishing five LCD TV production plants around the world to supply worldwide markets. Sharp's Mexico-based LCD TV production will begin this September. Poland will be up and running by January 2007 to supply the European market.</p>

<p>The details on the new models were found in <a href="http://sharp-world.com/corporate/news/060831_1.html">another press release</a>, and there are a total of six Full HD AQUOS LCD TVs. There are two sets: one set has the speakers on the side and the other set has speakers on the bottom. Sharp is serious about Full HD. The model numbers for the side-speaker design are:</p>
<p>LC-42GX2W<br />
LC-46GX2W<br />
LC-52GX2W</p>
<p>The bottom-speaker design model numbers are:</p>
<p>LC-42GX1W<br />
LC-46GX1W<br />
LC-52GX1W</p>
<p>These models have a newly developed Black Advanced Super View Full-Spec HD LCD panels that has 2000:1 contrast ratio, a response time of 4ms. One of the weak points of LCD TVs were performance in high ambient light situation. Sharp is touting a 650:1 "living room contrast ratio". I could not find out the details, but it seems Sharp is moving toward specifications that don't mean much in terms of details, but a specification that is more important to the average consumer, even though they wouldn't know what it would mean to them at their own living rooms. Go figure. There are two HDMI ports for your <strike>super-expensive Blu-Ray drive</strike> PlayStation 3 and whatever else you would need the extra HDMI port for in the future.</p>
