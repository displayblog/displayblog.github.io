<p><a href="https://www.thurrott.com/mobile/windows-phone/4512/analysis-microsoft-is-scaling-back-on-windows-phone-dramatically">Paul Thurrott</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p> The company that makes over 96 percent of all Windows Phone handsets in use just wrote off $7.6 billion related to its Windows Phone assets, and has announced plans to dramatically scale back its mobile operations. And, yes, Windows Phone has fallen to just 3 percent market share worldwide too. Things aren&acirc;&euro;&trade;t going well.</blockquote></p>
<p>"The company" is Microsoft.</p>
<p>But could that mean Nadella wants to pair down mobile operations so Microsoft focuses on building just one Lumia Windows Phone? If so, that would be good.</p>
<p>Have Microsoft designers and engineers focus on making one Lumia mobile device and do what Toyota does: Identify your market segment. Establish the retail price. And work backwards. Microsoft could build the Hyundai Sonata of smartphones: reliable, good looking, and with everything you need without the fluff.</p>
<p>Let's hope this is what Nadella has in mind for Windows Phone.</p>
