<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/14/nokia-n8-review/">Engadget</a>'s Vlad Savov regarding the display:</p>
<blockquote><p>What lies beneath it is a 3.5-inch AMOLED display stretching to 640 x 360 resolution. That's obviously not the densest panel you can own anymore, but neither is it a slouch. The N8's vibrancy and color saturation look highly accurate while the auto-brightness guesses correctly most of the time and gives you enough power -- unless you've got the sun shining directly down on the phone, of course -- to get on with your Symbian^3 business. That resolution is really the only thing holding this display back, but it's not like Nokia can do too much about it now.</blockquote></p>
<p>Not the densest panel? How about near-bottom? All high-end Android phones are at 800x480. Windows Phone 7 hardware is at 800x480. The iPhone leads with 960x640. Correction: the N8's display in terms of pixel density is not near-bottom but at rock bottom. At least the N8's display is tough thanks to Corning's Gorilla Glass.</p>
