<p>The ViewSonic V3D241wm is a 24-inch 3D LCD monitor sporting a LED backlight and a 1920x1080 pixel format. The V3D241wm packs a 120Hz frequency, a 2ms response time (GTG), a brightness of 300 cd/m2 and comes with a pair of active-shutter 3D glasses. There is an Eco mode when you're not gaming or watching videos.</p>
<p>The 170/160 viewing angles fall short of being great and the purely fictional 20,000,000:1 should simply be ignored. I don't know why companies bother with dynamic contrast ratios. Connectivity options include VGA, DVI-D and HDMI. Available in the UK for &Acirc;&pound;330.
