<p>Facts: Using NEC&#39;s SA-IPS technology, the 20WGX2 is a 20.1" wide LCD monitor with 1680 x 1050 pixel format making the aspect ratio 16:10. IPS generates a wide viewing cone at 178 degrees all around calculated based on images that maintain a higher than 10:1 contrast ratio. Contrast ratio is 700:1, brightness is 470 cd/m2 and response times are 6ms gray-to-gray and 12ms black-white-black. Has D-Sub and DVI-D inputs in addition to four USB 2.0 ports.</p>
<p>Opinion: The guys at TrustedReviews knocked it for its higher price, the glossy screen and lack of height and pivot adjusting capabilities but like the 1680 x 1050 pixel format for movies. I don&#39;t use pivoting because in portrait mode, the display slows down dramatically. I do think that glossy screens can get in the way of enjoying work (if that&#39;s possible!), games or movies. Wide is definitely cool, but can we move up to 1920 x 1200 at these sizes?</p>
