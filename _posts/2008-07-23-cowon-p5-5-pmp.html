<p><a href="http://product.cowon.com/product/COWONP5/standard/product_page_1.php">Cowon</a>: This little portable multimedia player (PMP) from Cowon is quite sexy. The P5, like the name suggests, has a 5-inch wide TFT LCD with touch and haptic capability. The LCD sports a pixel format of 800x480 and can playback a variety of video formats including AVI, ASF, MPEG4 and others. Gallery after the jump.</p>
<p>Of course, it being a PMP, playback of audio and images files are supported. The P5 can also connect to T-DMB broadcasts for live TV on-the-go as well as FM radio. It can also voice record. The T5 comes in three colors: red, platinum and black. All three colors are based on a brushed aluminum design, which makes it ultra modern looking. The only thing about the P5 that makes it less than perfect is the use of an external USB dongle for WiFi connectivity. The P5 is still quite the sexy PMP in my book.</p>
