<p><a href="http://www.ledsmagazine.com/news/4/4/13">LEDs Magazine</a>: The BMW 5 Series sedan has 18 LEDs that form two rows at the upper edge for the combination rear lamp direction indicator. The rear light design wraps around the corner and merges into the side marker lamp where four more LEDs are used and a reflex reflector. The really cool-looking part of the rear light uses five light guides that are lit up by one LED each.</p>
