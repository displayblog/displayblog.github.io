<p>New Yorkers paying AT&amp;T for wireless service should be getting better service. The company's internal testing shows voice quality in Manhattan improved 47% compared to last quarter. That's an interesting statistic:</p>
<p>"Guess what?"<br />
"What?"<br />
"I think my iPhone 4 has better voice quality now."<br />
"Yeah?"<br />
"Yeah, about 47% better."<br />
"Huh?"<br />
"Yup, 47% better than last quarter."</p>
<p>I think it would be much more effective if AT&amp;T and other companies measured and communicated improvements that make sense to customers. For instance:</p>
<blockquote><p>AT&amp;T wireless customers should be able to connect and experience less dropped calls in these areas: West Side Highway, Cross Bronx Expressway, Newark, Long Island City, Sunnyside, Oyster Bay, Upper East Side between 87th and 94th...</blockquote><br />
Now wouldn't that make more sense to New York City customers since those dead zones are where they experience the most frustration with AT&amp;T? The iPhone carrier finished upgrading its 850MHz 3G in The Big Apple. Read the <a href="http://www.att.com/gen/press-room?pid=18064&amp;cdvn=news&amp;newsarticleid=30908&amp;mapcode=financial">press release</a> for all the details. The upgrade was an increase in wireless capacity in Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens. AT&amp;T expects its customers to experience "improved 3G wireless voice and data connectivity and performance, especially during peak hours." But we all know it isn't just AT&amp;T who needs to continue improving connectivity.</p>
