<p>David Pierce, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/13/4097378/roku-3-review">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The good news is that if you're not an Apple user or don't have much need for AirPlay, you only need one box &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; and that box is the $99.99 Roku 3. It's the best, most versatile, and most usable set-top box on the market, and buying it is a no-brainer.</blockquote></p>
<p>Search what you want to watch and Roku 3 will generate a list of where you can watch it and how much it will cost. The list of where includes: Amazon Instant Video, Netflix, Hulu Plus, Blockbuster on Demand, HBO GO, MLB.TV, Crackle, Disney, VEVO, etc. Nice.</p>
