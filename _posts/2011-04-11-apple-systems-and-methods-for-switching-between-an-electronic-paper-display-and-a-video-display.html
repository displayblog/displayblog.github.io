<p><a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/07/apple_exploring_hybrid_e_ink_lcd_displays_with_independent_regions.html">AppleInsider</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple has shown interest in creating a new iPad with a hybrid display that could dynamically switch all or just part of the full-color screen to low-power black-and-white e-ink for text and other static content.</p>
<p>The new dynamic, hybrid system described by Apple could have sections of the screen operate as a traditional LCD screen for displaying video, while other parts with static content would be served up in e-ink. Rather than depending on the user to switch between e-ink and LCD, Apple's system would handle the work and provide content in the ideal context.</blockquote></p>
<p>In Apple's patent application titled "Systems and Methods for Switching Between an Electronic Paper Display and a Video Display" the electronic paper portion of the display would sit on top of the video display. In other words, an E Ink-like display would sit on top of an IPS LCD. In this structure the E Ink will need to have a transparent substrate, which isn't the case at the moment. Combining two different technologies into a single hybrid display might result in something a little too thick, too costly, or just not good for either reading or multimedia. There is also the chance that Apple's filing is just as a precaution and not part of any plans for a real product in the future.</p>
<p>I personally do not enjoy reading from an LCD even if it's a state-of-the-art IPS display. In the short time I had an e-book reader from Sony I really enjoyed the more natural reading experience of an electronic paper display. If Apple can build a hybrid display that makes use of both an E Ink-like electronic paper display as well as an IPS LCD that's both thin and affordable that would be the holy grail of displays.</p>
