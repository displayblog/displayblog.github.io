<p>In US$ it would be 367 million and the 16% rise is compared to June 2005. Revenes compared to May 2006 fell NT$0.1 billion. CMO has been focusing on LCD TV panel production and is one of the largest in the world. However with weak brand partners for 37" and 42" sizes, CMO and others have been finding it difficult to clear out inventory. You might be able to find really great deals on 37" and 42" models as they will have to lower prices to move them out.
