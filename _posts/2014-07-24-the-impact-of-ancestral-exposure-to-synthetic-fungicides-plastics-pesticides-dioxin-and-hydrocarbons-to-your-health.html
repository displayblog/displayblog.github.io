<p><a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0102091">PLOS ONE</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Environmental compounds including fungicides, plastics, pesticides, dioxin and hydrocarbons can promote the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult-onset disease in future generation progeny following ancestral exposure during the critical period of fetal gonadal sex determination.</blockquote></p>
<p>In other words, your grandparents' exposure to fungicides, plastics, pesticides, dioxin, and hydrocarbons negatively impacts your health, today. So be good to your future grandchildren and reduce your exposure to these poisons.</p>
