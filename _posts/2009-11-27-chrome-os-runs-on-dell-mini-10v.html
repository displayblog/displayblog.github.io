<p><a href="http://en.community.dell.com/blogs/direct2dell/archive/2009/11/25/chrome-os-wi-fi-support-running-on-a-mini-10v-source-code-available.aspx">Direct2Dell</a>: Chrome OS has been hacked thanks to Doug A. and now runs on Dell's Mini 10v including WiFi. Not perfect, but working: The ChromiumOS network connection may take up to 5-10 minutes to see your WiFi connections. A USB image as well as instructions are available for download at Direct2Dell. I expect Chrome OS to be ported over to pretty much everything, and soon.</p>
