<p>Wendy's will auction more than $30,000 worth of cool stuff including a <a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3Autpr0mvi0e9&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=panasonic&amp;sa=Search">Panasonic</a> PT50PD3P, a <a href="http://www.google.com/custom?hl=en&amp;safe=active&amp;client=pub-1028052232505250&amp;channel=0117441043&amp;cof=FORID%3A13%3BAH%3Aleft%3BS%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.displayblog.com%3BCX%3ADisplayBlog%2520Search%2520Engine%3BL%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.displayblog.com%2Fwp-content%2Fthemes%2FProSense-Grey%2Fimages%2Fdisplayblog_logo_03_thin.jpg%3BLH%3A50%3BLC%3A%230000ff%3BVLC%3A%23663399%3BGFNT%3A%230000ff%3BGIMP%3A%230000ff%3BDIV%3A%23336699%3B&amp;adkw=AELymgU5CzZzI8VZ9FFMtjthtHtpZw0g1JeWGZFP_fBTbGP4G135FqscdfZxEMBhbPolXZrnGFRWoXuaHPPjxivyWi1pd8wotIOZQ2X71TF6tCKY6oCZR9eDUeTfjKtGQmTXLWl9QFiyYIKYWL_EtKqSwi9uRKYojyan-GQysTon99yCmnb1KLeBXC7Igc8qpXyKz6ERFlWxd9pflBqVsCBOTjp3dOq9Lg&amp;boostcse=0&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;oe=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=50%22+720p+plasma&amp;btnG=Search&amp;cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3Autpr0mvi0e9">50" 720p plasma TV</a>. Each and every item will be auctioned off for just 99 cents.&Acirc;&nbsp;Bidding for each item will begin at its full value price and then decrease with each additional bid until the final amount of 99 cents is reached for that item. And that means the PT50PD3P can be had for just 99 cents! The auction for the 50" Panasonic plasma TV as well as a Xbox 360 Elite and an Ultimate Game Chair will be held on Friday, April 3, 2009.</p>
<p>The website where the auction will be hosted is at <a href="http://www.99centbidforvalue.com">www.99centbidforvalue.com</a>. I'll be attending a press conference at noon PST on Monday, March 23, 2009. During that time a live video stream will be right here on DisplayBlog for you to watch and listen to any questions. <strong>Update</strong>: Well that time has come and gone as of 12:21PM. Nothing out of the ordinary. There was one question about winning multiple times. You can but you have to choose just one prize.</p>
<p>For those of you who for some reason weren't able to attend, I'll be posting up a video of the press conference that explains a bit more about this auction after the press conference is over.</p>
