<p>On June 4, 2008, Softbank Mobile announced that it has inked a deal with Apple. Softbank will be bringing the black market <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=iphone">iPhone</a> above ground in Japan. When? Later this year is all that Impress is reporting. The interesting thing about this development is that Japan doesn't have a GSM voice network, as far as I know. There are 3G networks available there via eMobile, NTT Docomo, Softbank Mobile (J-Mobile).</p>

<p>Maybe Apple has engineered a flashable baseband chip that can operate on any network: all you need to do is flash the appropriate one. Or, maybe Apple has put the functions of the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/05/13/second-generation-iphone-gsm-cdma-ev-do-hsdpa/">baseband chips into software and let the powerful chips run them, via P.A. Semi</a>. All of these speculations will be useless come June 9. Can't wait.</p>
