<p>January 2008, Steve Jobs on e-readers:</p>
<blockquote><p>It doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t matter how good or bad the product is, the fact is that people don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t read anymore. Forty percent of the people in the U.S. read one book or less last year. The whole conception is flawed at the top because people don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t read anymore.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/12/15/2637699/economist-rebirth-reading-lean-back">Jamie Keene, The Verge</a>:</p>

The concept of Lean Back 2.0 is relatively simple &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; the use of tablets and e-readers is growing at the expense of print and web use, with <em>The Economist's</em> iPad readers spending on average around 90 minutes with the app each week. Unlike the desktop and laptop web experience, these devices are allowing users to read at their leisure.</blockquote></p>
