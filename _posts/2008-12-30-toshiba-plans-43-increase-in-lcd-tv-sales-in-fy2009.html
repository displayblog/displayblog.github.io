<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=toshiba">Toshiba</a> has plans to increase its LCD TV sales in FY2009 by 43% Y/Y to 10 million units. The company's FY2009 ends in March 2010. For FY2008, Toshiba is expecting to have shipped 7 million LCD TVs with about a 6% market share. The company with 10 million units in FY2009 will capture roughly 10% of the global market for LCD TVs.</p>
<p>Recently, Toshiba has tapped Wistron to manufacture 2 million LCD TVs in 2009. Toshiba is increasing its outsourcing to Taiwan to reduce the cost of manufacturing LCD TVs. Compal has been manufacturing some LCD TVs for Toshiba and will continue to do so at a 2 million unit pace in 2009.</p>
<p>Toshiba is also ramping up its marketing in the Southeast Asian region and plans to spend RM20 million on advertising and promotions in 2009. The company's Jarkarta plant's sales revenue goal for 2009 is expected to be around RM650 million and will be a continuation of rapid growth: Toshiba Malaysia has recorded an annual growth rate of 30% over the last two years.</p>
