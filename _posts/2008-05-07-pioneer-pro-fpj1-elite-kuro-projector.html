<p>Pioneer is getting into the high-end projection business with its PRO-FPJ1 Elite KURO front projector that is geared toward cinematic installations. Pioneer is stating that advanced calibration is available on the PRO-FPJ1 and that black levels are just as black as the KURO TVs. The PRO-FPJ1 features three viewing modes including standard, dynamic and movie. The price of $9000 is incredible, which better describe the picture quality.</p>
