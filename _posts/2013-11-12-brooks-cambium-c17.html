<p><a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3021494/wanted/from-ideo-a-bike-seat-that-wont-make-your-butt-hurt">Margaret Rhodes, Co.Design</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Overthun and his team proposed a medley of things--cork, gel, fabrics layered with felt--to the Brooks team, which then took over. Brooks landed on a vulcanized rubber base, with organic cotton lining (that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s wicked for waterproofing--something the old seats didn't have), &acirc;&euro;&oelig;because both these materials feel very real and not plastic,&acirc;&euro; Overthun says. The result is a bike seat that has all the aesthetic pedigree of the original leather models, minus the aching derriere. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;The lighter version is a littler easier to love right away,&acirc;&euro; Overthun says.</blockquote></p>
