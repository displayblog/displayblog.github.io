<p>National Semiconductor&#39;s point-to-point differential signaling (PPDS) is a fast intra-panel interface that allows a 10-bit information pathway without generating more than acceptable electro-magnetic interference (EMI). The current signaling technology that is incorporate in most LCD panels is RSDS, an acronym for reduced swing differential signaling, and LVDS (low-voltage differential signaling). PPDS allows more efficient control (up to 50% reduction of number of column driver input signals) over column driver ICs that will result in improved display performance, smaller bezels (small PCB size), etc. PPDS enables 10-bit color (more than 1 billion colors), very large sizes up to 90" (so LPL&#39;s 100" LCD is out?), and pixel formats up to 1920 x 1080. The chipset incorporates a column driver and a timing controller (TCon) for a complete solution.</p>
<p>Himax Technologies, MagnaChip and STMicroelectronics announced that they have licensed National&#39;s PPDS technology to develop next-gen column drivers for LCD panels. CMO also announced that it will incorporate National&#39;s PPDS into its LCD TV panels.</p>
