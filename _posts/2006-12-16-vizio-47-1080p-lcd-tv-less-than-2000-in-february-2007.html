<p>Vizio's CEO, William Wang, commented that a $3000 price for a 1080p-cable LCD TV can not be called affordable. So what is he going to do about it? Before the Super Bowl (early February), or even before the end of 2006, Vizio is planning to offer a 47" LCD TV that is capable of displaying content in 1080p for less than $2000. That is impressive. First of all, the size is larger than what Sony and Samsung is offering as their largest 40"-range by 1" and for more than $1000 less. Are the first-tier brands such as Sony, Samsung and Sharp worth an extra $1000 at the high 40" sizes? By February 2007, we'll know the answer.</p>
<p>The largest LCD TV that Vizio currently offers is a 46" unit, the GV46L, for $1699. That's already a very good price, but the resolution is just 1366 x 768. The GV46L has a ATSC, NTSC, QAM combo tuner, HDMI with HDCP and PC inputs, 8ms response time, 178-degree viewing angles, 1600:1 contrast and 500 cd/m2 of brightness. We can probably expect the 47" to have similar features, which are fairly good.</p>
<p><em>Update 2007.01.03</em><br />
The model name is GV47L and is priced aggressively at <strong>$1899.99</strong>. Specifications include a brightness of 500 cd/m2, 800:1 contrast ratio (1600:1 with DCR), 16.7 million colors, and a response time of 8ms. The LCD panel is of IPS variety, supplied by LG.Philips LCD (LPL), giving you 178-degree viewing angles. The GV47L also has a anti-glare hard-coated surface and a 50,000 hour half-life. Included is tuner that can handle ATSC, QAM, NTSC with color temperature tuning among 6500K, 5400K, 9300K. There are two HDMI ports, two Component YPbPr video inputs, a VGA input, S-Video and Composite Video.</p>
