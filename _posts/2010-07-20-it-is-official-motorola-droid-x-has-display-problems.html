<p>Verizon Wireless <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/07/20/verizon-confirms-droid-x-screen-issues-but-says-theyre-not-wid/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Verizon Wireless and Motorola are aware of a very small number of DROID X units that have experienced a flickering or banding display. Motorola has resolved the issue and is continuing to ship the phones. Any consumer who experiences a flickering or banding display should contact a Motorola customer support center or Verizon Wireless.</blockquote></p>
<p>That very small number is approximately 0.1%. For details about the problem have a look at <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/07/19/droid-x-defective-displays/"><em>Droid X: Defective Displays</em></a>.</p>
