<p><img class="size-full wp-image-6546 aligncenter" title="Nikon_COOLPIX_S70_OLED" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Nikon_COOLPIX_S70_OLED.jpg" alt="Nikon_COOLPIX_S70_OLED" width="224" height="861" /><strong>OLED</strong> Nikon introduced its COOLPIX S70 digital compact camera on August 4, 2009. Since I'm most interested in display-related features, let's start with that: the COOLPIX S70 sports a 3.5-inch <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=oled&amp;sa=Search#1444">OLED</a> display. An OLED display can be considered a high-end feature on a digital camera since this technology does cost quite a bit more than LCD.</p>
<p><strong>288K</strong> For some very odd reason, camera manufacturers list the total number of pixels of the display instead of the x by y that we are used to for almost all other displays. Nikon states a "288k-dot resolution". Is that suppose to help me in any way shape or form as to how nice the OLED display is? The resolution should be around 640 x 450 (I'm not sure), which is quite high for a compact digital. That's almost VGA class--stuff you see on DSLRs.</p>
<p><strong>Capacitive</strong> There are generally two types of touch technologies: resistive and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=capacitive&amp;sa=Search#1518">capacitive</a>. Usually, resistive is the older and less responsive technology while capacitive is the newer more responsive one. Apple chose capacitive touch technology for its iconic <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=iphone&amp;sa=Search#1490">iPhone</a> smartphone. The fact that Nikon makes use of capacitive touch on its digital camera display is another indication that the company is serious about making the user experience on the COOLPIX S70 a good one--at least when it comes to the display. I wonder if it is <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=multitouch&amp;sa=Search#1688">multitouch</a>...</p>
<p><strong>High-End</strong> In my opinion, combining a high-resolution 3.5-inch OLED display and capacitive touch technology on the COOLPIX S70 points to Nikon placing more importance to the user experiencing around the display. And that's an important focus for several reasons: the touch display is the viewfinder and allows for selective autofocusing, the display is the menu system, and at times the display becomes a limited canvas where you make changes to the pictures and/or videos like cropping and clipping. Finally, the display becomes well the display where you review your pictures and video. Making the display better makes the experience better. Good move Nikon. Eventually the display will become the digital camera with the exception of the lens, memory and battery.</p>
