<p>IP trolls. I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t like them. They have some characteristics that are easily identified: IP trolls get a patent, then wait for the market to grow very large, sue everybody, and defend their actions by saying something like, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Our company invests millions of dollars in developing leading edge technologies that have widespread use across a variety of industries, and we take necessary steps to protect our investments.&acirc;&euro;¬ù</p>
<p>And that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s what Honeywell said.</p>
<p>In October 2004, after waiting many years for the LCD industry to grow, Honeywell filed a lawsuit in US District Court for the District of Delaware against 34 electronics companies (mostly LCD manufacturers) and the litigation is still pending. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m sure there are some very happy patent lawyers that are charging Honeywell by the hour. Because International Display Technology (IDTech) licensed this particular &acirc;&euro;&tilde;371 patent, they will be dismissed from the litigation. The &acirc;&euro;&tilde;371 patent (US Patent No. 5,280,371) makes LCDs brighter with less image distortions. The other companies that <strike>are being sued are</strike> have licensed the 371 patent from Honeywell are: AU Optronics (AUO), HannStar Display, Toshiba Corporation, Toshiba Matsushita Display (TMDisplay), Sharp Corporation, Sanyo Electric Co., Sanyo Epson Imaging Devices Corp., Chunghwa Picture Tubes (CPT), LG.Philips LCD (LPL), NEC LCD Technologies, Chi Mei Optoelectronics (CMO), and Samsung Electronics.</p>
<p>I have a thought: Maybe these companies can come together and sue Honeywell and then take away all of the LCDs that Honeywell is using. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m sure they are using quite a bit. Did I mention I hate IP trolls?</p>
