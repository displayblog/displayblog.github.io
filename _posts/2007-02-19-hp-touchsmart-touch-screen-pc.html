<p>HP's TouchSmart PC is an all-in-one touch-screen PC and is powered by Microsoft's Vista and AMD's Turion 64 X2 TL-52. HP held a consumer press launch in Seoul, South Korea from January 24 to 25. There is only a single power cord coming out of the TouchSmart. The LCD is a 19" wide with a likely pixel format of 1440 x 900. I have a family and remembering the day-to-day schedules can be a chore. I think the folks over at HP knew that a lot of families might need a bit of help. Calendar events, voice, written or typed messages can be created easily and personalized pages can be quickly accessed via HP's SmartCentre.</p>
<p>On the front are media card readers, audio &amp; video inputs, and a slot-load multi-DVD burner. As far as I know, this is the first non-Apple implementation of a slot-load optical drive by a major brand. Other features include a built-in 1.3 megapixel camera, a FM and TV tuner, WiFi, Bluetooth, wireless keyboard &amp; mouse, stylus and remote control. Availability is slated for April of this year with a street price of $2,499.</p>
<p>I like all the integration and the move to a touch-based interaction on a desktop computer is commendable. But the price of $2500 is a bit on the high side. If Apple came out with a multi-touch capable 20" iMac, I would be surprised if it was $2500.</p>
