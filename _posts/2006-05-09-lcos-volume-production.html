<p>Liquid Crystal on Silicon (LCoS) has been a projection system with a lot of hype. With much purer representation of images and videos that is smoother than DLP&#39;s harsh edges, many have been waiting for affordable LCoS-based rear-projection TVs (RPTVs). Maybe the wait is over, but don&#39;t hold your breath.</p>
<p>Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) based in China and Aurora Systems based in the US have announced that Aurora&#39;s LCoS chips have begun mass production at SMIC. This is good news. Finally, affordable LCoS TVs in the future. Of course, Syntax already provides quite affordable LCoS TVs, but I&#39;m not sure if I would want to purchase a Syntax-branded TV to put in my living room. Aurora&#39;s LCoS chip has two varieties: 1920*1080 and 1280*720. It is claimed by Aurora that several CE brands have already incorporated their chips in LCoS RPTVs.  Aurora has been engaging with SMIC since early 2005 according to Aurora&#39;s CEO Poking Li.
