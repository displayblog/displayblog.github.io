<p>At just US$149.99 the Kobo from Borders is a no-frills e-reader for quite a bit less than Amazon's Kindle or B&amp;N's Nook. The Kobo is available now and will begin shipping on June 17th. I'm not liking the blue d-pad but for the price I shouldn't be too picky, I guess. Source: <a href="http://www.borders.com/online/store/MediaView_koboereader">Borders</a></p>
