<p>At <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dell">Dell</a>'s Worldwide Supplier Conference held in Austin, TX, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lg.philips-lcd">LG.Philips LCD</a> received the Supplier of the Year Award from Dell in recognition of LPL's product technology and customer satisfaction. Michael Dell presented the award. In 2006, amid difficulties in the LCD industry, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lpl">LPL</a> reorganized it structure into applications-based business units: IT, TV, Small and Medium Display. The company also launched a Customer Value Creation Team in the hopes of reshaping the company toward a customer centric culture.</p>
