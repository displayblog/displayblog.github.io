<p>Sony&#39;s new entrant into the digital SLR market is aptly named DSLR-A100. For previews about the A100, please go to my favorite digital photography site, <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/articles/sonydslra100/">DPReview</a>. I will briefly focus on the LCD that comes with the A100. It is a 2.5" LCD that is titled "Clear Photo LCD Plus" and has 230,000 pixels. DPReview states that the image quality on the LCD is "very good" and its viewing angles are "good".</p>
