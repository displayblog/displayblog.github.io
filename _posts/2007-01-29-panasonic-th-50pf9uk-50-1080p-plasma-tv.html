<p>Panasonic's TH-50PF9UK plasma display panel (PDP) TV sports Full HD 1080p capability with a pixel format of 1920 x 1080. Unlike other "1080p capable" PDP TV sets, the TH-50PF9UK is truly a real Full HD PDP TV. The contrast ratio is 5000:1, viewing angles are 160 degrees and response time super fast, like any PDP TV. Just a quick note on PDP TV response times: there is really no meaning in measuring PDP TV response times because they are so fast. The TH-50PF9UK comes with VGA, DVI and other inputs and has a tuner than is compatible with NTSC, PAL and SECAM. Unfortunately, the TH-50PF9UK lacks a ATSC tuner.</p>
<p>c|net's article states the TH-50PF9UK as only the second 50" PDP TV to sport a 1920 x 1080 pixel format with Pioneer's Pro-FHD1 to be the very first. The article compares the two but gives the highest praise to the Pro-FHD1 for outstanding picture quality. Overall, c|net gave the TH-50PF9UK a 8.3 mark out of 10.</p>
