<p>BOE launched its LCD module business for mobile phones and shipped the first 2" units to a Korean mobile phone manufacturer. On its L1 and L3 fabs, BOE produces 1.8"-5" panels targeted toward mobile phones, PMPs, digital cameras, and MP3 players. The article in Wireless Design &amp; Development asia also puts in UMPCs, but as far as I know, those require a 7" LCD. Currently, BOE's capacity is 1.5 million units per month but wants to increase it to 2.5 million per month by the fourth quarter of 2006.</p>
<p>Although mobile phones have exploded to more than 700 million units annually, in geographic areas such as the US, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Western Europe, etc. where mobile phone penetration is high, continued growth as we have seen in the past few years will undoubtedly slow down. Prices for mobile phone panels have dropped quickly and if BOE wants to succeed, it will need to focus on cost reduction and getting the right customers like Nokia, Samsung, LG and Motorola.</p>
