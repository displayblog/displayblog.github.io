<blockquote><p>The Desire S makes use of the same Super LCD tech as the Incredible S, leaving us to only echo what we said of its bigger sibling. You get vibrant, well saturated images, which also benefit from excellent viewing angles. The only weakness is readability in direct sunlight. One thing we omitted to mention in the Incredible S review was that the screen is protected by Gorilla Glass, a feature that has naturally been included on the Desire S as well.</blockquote></p>
<p>The only LCD that works well in direct sunlight is Pixel Qi's display in reflective mode. I wonder why smartphone display manufacturers have not embraced Pixel Qi's technology as it would help a great deal with readability when out in direct sunlight. The Super LCD in the HTC Desire S looks to be a winner.</p>
