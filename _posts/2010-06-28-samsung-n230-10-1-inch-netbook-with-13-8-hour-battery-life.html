<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-11470 aligncenter" title="Samsung_N230_10inch_Netbook_1024x600_Antireflective_LCD" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Samsung_N230_10inch_Netbook_1024x600_Antireflective_LCD.jpg" alt="" width="511"   /></p><br />
On June 28th Samsung will let loose its N230 netbook sporting a 10.1-inch anti-reflective LED-backlit LCD with a 1024x600 pixel format. Samsung claims there is no mirror effect in bright conditions. That's a solid change in direction from mirror to actual display. Battery life is rated at 13.8 hours with the optional 66Wh battery and the standard 32Wh battery will last the N230 for up to 7 hours. The N230 is powered by an Intel Atom N450 running at 1.66GHz or a 1.83GHz N470. Weight is less than 1kg or 2.2 pounds with a thickness of just 23.2mm or 0.91 inch. Connectivity options include Bluetooth 3.0, WiFi BGN, and optional 3G. <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/28/samsung-n230-netbook-ships-with-13-8-hours-of-pretend-fun/">Engadget</a></p>
