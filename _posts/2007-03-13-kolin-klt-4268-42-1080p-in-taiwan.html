<p class="P1">Kolin celebrated its one million LCD TV shipments by introducing its KLT-4268, a 42" LCD TV with Full HD 1080p capability. The pixel format, of course, is in a 16:9 aspect ratio with 1920 x 1080 pixels. The price in Taiwan is NT$59,900 or about US$1800. Not terribly cheap, but on the aggressive side.</p></p>
<p class="P2">The KLT-4268 features a brightness of 500 cd/m2, a contrast ratio of 1,500:1 and viewing angle of 176 degrees. Kolin follows up with Chi Mei's announcement of a 42" Full HD LCD TV offered at NT$54,900 just last month. Here is a list of other brands and prices for 42" Full HD LCD TVs:</p></p>
<p class="P2">Asus: NT$82,900 (~US$2500)<br />
BenQ: NT$68,900 (~US$2090)<br />
Microtek: NT$54,900 (~US$1660)<br />
Tatung: NT$68,900 (~US$2090)<br />
Teco: NT$56,900 (~US$1724)<br />
</p>
<p class="P2">As you can see Microtek and Chi Mei has the lowest prices. I am led to believe that price declines will not be as drastic in the coming months, but maybe prices will fall to below $1499 for major brands like Samsung and Sony by the time Black Friday comes around in the US.</p></p>
