<p>Just looking at the specifications you would think you're looking at a LCD TV panel! The 2.2" LCD from Sharp is remarkable as it has an extremely high contrast ratio of 2000:1 and viewing angles that are better than most 17" and 19" LCD monitors and low-end LCD TVs. The 8ms is fairly quick too. Any mobile phone sporting this little 2.2" LCD will look fabulous.</p>
