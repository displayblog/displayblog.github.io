<p>You don't have to wait for AT&amp;T to stock the Galaxy S from Samsung (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/17/samsung-galaxy-s-with-super-amoled/">Samsung Galaxy S with Super AMOLED</a></em> for more info). Besides AT&amp;T will most likely rebadge it the Captivate for some odd reason. No need to go that way: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TLNZLI?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=displ0f-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003TLNZLI">Amazon</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=displ0f-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B003TLNZLI" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> has the unlocked version for $900 now. Yes, that's quite a bit of change. If you've got the money you'll be getting a smartphone with a much improved Super AMOLED 800x480 pixel display that is actually usable in direct sunlight (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/21/super-amoled-is-decent-in-the-sun/">Super AMOLED Is Decent In The Sun</a></em>).</p>
