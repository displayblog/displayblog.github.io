excerpt: '<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=rohm">Rohm</a>
  showcased its <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=oled">OLED</a>
  technology as a light source at <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=ceatec">CEATEC</a>.
  The prototype emitted brightness levels around 3000 to 4000 cd/m2 with flahes
  of 100,000 cd/m2. Clearly, the type of light source Rohm is targeting with its
  OLED solutions were flashlights and residential (commercial?) lamps. A unique feature
  of the OLED lamp was that it does not result in any shadows due to a complex light
  diffusing technology (most likely a film). But the OLED light source would not be
  adequate as a backlight for LCDs. '

<p>Clearly, these technology solutions were not targeting backlight applications for LCDs. While engadget's Samuel Axon seems to think this is 10 and 250 times the brightness of a typical LCD display, what he does not realize is that the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=backlight">backlight</a> unit (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=blu">BLU</a>) of current LCD displays already exhibit 100,000 cd/m2 of brightness. The reason why you get about 300 cd/m2 on the front of the LCD is because light gets absorbed by many parts of the LCD, roughly 70% being absorbed by the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=color-filter">color filter</a> alone. Typically, you get roughly 2.5% to 3% of the BLU output at the front of the LCD. So, what Rohm has showcased is an OLED backlight solution that is almost capable of meeting today's standards. The 100,000 cd/m2 of brightness will need to be consistently delivered for an OLED-based BLU to be considered equal to today's CCFL and LED based BLUs. Axon does rightly state that longevity of OLEDs is a major challenge that needs to be overcome.</p>
