<p><a href="http://www.dpreview.com/previews/sony-cybershot-dsc-rx1/">Richard Butler, DPReview</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We were surprised (and delighted) when Sony decided to create the RX100 - its first compact camera for serious photographers, but that's nothing compared to our surprise when we were told about the RX1. This isn't just Sony's most serious compact camera, but arguably the most serious compact camera we've ever seen. It features a full-frame sensor and a fixed 35mm F2 lens, making it a real heavyweight in terms of lightweight photography. Sony has said it is targeting professional photographers and we see no reason to question that.</blockquote></p>
<p>Sony posted <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sonyelectronics/sets/72157631631658271/with/8028155112/">RX1 sample images</a> on Flickr. So tempting.</p>
