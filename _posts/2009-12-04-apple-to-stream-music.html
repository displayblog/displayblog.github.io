Lala sells songs for 10 cents each and stores it on the company's servers, a cloud music service. Would Apple offer such a service? We will have to wait and see but I think it is quite possible especially for iPhone users that have a persistent data connection.&Acirc;&nbsp;<em>via</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/12/04/apple-looking-to-buy-lala-get-into-streaming-music/">Engadget</a></p>
