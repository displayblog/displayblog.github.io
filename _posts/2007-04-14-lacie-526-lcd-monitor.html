<p><a href="http://www.lacie.com/us/products/product.htm?pid=10896">Lacie</a>: The LaCie 526 LCD monitor is a professional grade 26" (25.5" actual) display using H-IPS technology that feature some impressive specifications. The 91% NTSC is a strong indicator that this is for those who value color fidelity. The 178/178 viewing angle is superb, just like an IPS panel should. The only knock on an otherwise great monitor is the price: $1909.99.</p>
