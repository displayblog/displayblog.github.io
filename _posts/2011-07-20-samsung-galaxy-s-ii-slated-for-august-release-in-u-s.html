<p>Jong-kyun Shin, Samsung Mobile Business and Digital Imaging President, <a href="http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/techscience/2011/07/20/2/0601000000AEN20110720005400320F.HTML">Yonhap News Agency</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We expect to release the Galaxy S2 in the U.S. market sometime in August.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S II, the followup to the Galaxy S, sports a 4.3-inch Super AMOLED Plus display with a 800x480 RGB pixel format. The Galaxy S II is the fastest-selling smartphone in Samsung's history, getting into the hands of three million customers in just 55 days.</p>
<p>August might not be a good month to release a smartphone. It is too close to a possible iPhone announcement the very next month.</p>
