<p><a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/an_antitrust_app_buvCWcJdjFoLD5vBSkguGO">New York Post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to a person familiar with the matter, the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission are locked in negotiations over which of the watchdogs will begin an antitrust inquiry into Apple's new policy of requiring software developers who devise applications for devices such as the iPhone and iPad to use only Apple's programming tools.</blockquote><br />
The iPad is Apple's. The iPhone OS that runs on the iPad is Apple's. What Apple wants to do with what Apple owns is Apple's business. I guess the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission isn't busy enough with important matters or maybe they want to get on the case of another great American company in the hopes of leaving a lasting, most likely negative, mark.</p>
<p>Food for thought. Michael Gartenberg in&Acirc;&nbsp;<em><a href="http://gartenblog.net/2010/05/03/1000000-ipads-28-days/">1,000,000 iPads. 28 days. First Take</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The reason Apple was successful was they optimized for the form factor.</blockquote><br />
The very essence of Apple's success with the iPad is being questioned by government institutions that know nothing about optimization.</p>
<p>I think I may have THE solution: Develop a special government-only version of the iPad that allows for developers to use any programming tools they wish. These special apps must pass one test: it must be compatible with all currently available portable devices ensuring platform neutrality and experience suckiness.</p>
