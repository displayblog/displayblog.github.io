<p><a href="http://www.asianewsnet.net/home/news.php?id=19099&amp;sec=2">Asia News Network</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple Inc&acirc;&euro;&trade;s chief operating officer Tim Cook discussed adopting Samsung&acirc;&euro;&trade;s AMOLED display technology for tablet PCs during his recent visit to South Korea, industry sources said.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Apple wants to tap into Samsung&acirc;&euro;&trade;s AMOLED technology for an upgraded version of the iPad2, considered as many as the iPad3 that is likely to be launched toward the end of this year,&acirc;&euro;¬ù a source told <em>The Korea Herald</em> on Wednesday (May 25) on condition of anonymity.</blockquote></p>
<p>I can see Apple using Samsung's Super AMOLED Plus technology on the next iPad as an interim step to a 2048x1536 Retina Display version.</p>
<p>But, and this is a big but, I've heard from an industry insider that it is easy to spot Samsung OLED-equipped smartphone users in South Korea: just look for smartphones with a bluish tint on the display. I asked, "Blue?" He wasn't sure why.</p>
<p>I am not certain that current solutions for differential aging of OLED materials are effective for displays that are used for more than a couple of years. Personally, I don't think Apple will adopt OLED for the next iPad, or the next one after that.</p>
