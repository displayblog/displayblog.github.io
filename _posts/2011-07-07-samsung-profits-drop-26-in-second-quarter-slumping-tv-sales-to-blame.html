<p><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-07-07/samsung-electronics-second-quarter-profit-drops-on-lcd-slump.html">Bloomberg Businessweek</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Samsung Electronics Co., the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s largest maker of televisions, posted a 26 percent drop in second-quarter profit after a slump in sales of flat screens masked a surge in demand for smartphones and tablet computers.</blockquote></p>
<p>With the possibility of Apple, Samsung's largest customer, shifting its SoC and flash memory business away from Samsung the future doesn't look too bright. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/06/28/rumor-apple-a6-by-tsmc-not-samsung/">Apple's A6 might be manufactured not by Samsung, but by TSMC</a>.</p>
<p>"Surge in demand" for Samsung Galaxy Tab-branded tablets sounds a bit exaggerated. Aside from Apple's iPad, demand for tablets has been weak. This according to <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2011/6/comScore_Introduces_Device_Essentials">comScore</a> on June 23:</p>
<blockquote><p>The iPad is currently the dominant tablet device across all geographies, contributing more than 89 percent of tablet traffic across all markets.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Galaxy S and Galaxy S II smartphones have been blockbusters. The Galaxy S II that sports a RGB OLED display is <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/07/04/samsung-galaxy-s-ii-three-million-in-55-days/">Samsung's fastest selling smartphone</a>. Unfortunately the legal battle with Apple continues on that could jeopardize smartphone sales.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> According to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-06/apple-increases-legal-battle-against-samsung-with-itc-case-1-.html">Bloomberg</a>, on July 5 Apple submitted a complaint to the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) seeking to block imports of the Galaxy S smartphone and Galaxy Tab tablet by Samsung.</p>
