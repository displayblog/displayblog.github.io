<p>Farhad Manjoo, <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/18/upgrading-to-ios-8-on-an-old-phone-prepare-for-trouble-but-do-it-anyway/">The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What are the costs of upgrading? Performance. Ars Technica installed iOS 8 on the iPhone 4S and the iPad 2, and in both cases it found that apps opened up slightly more slowly under the new OS. It took about <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/09/ios-8-on-the-iphone-4s-performance-isnt-the-only-problem/">2 seconds instead of 1</a> to open up Safari on a 4S running iOS 8 rather than 7.</blockquote></p>
<p>The iPhone 4s was released in October, 2011. That is four years ago, which for a high-tech device such as a smartphone is a very long time.  That the latest mobile operating system from Apple works on something that old is remarkable.</p>
<p>Yesterday I updated my iPhone 4s to iOS 8, and yes there is a negative impact to performance. Not surprising. But what is surprising is that my iPhone 4s is more than usable. Even though my iPhone 4s runs a little slower iOS 8 is worth the update, especially because of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/09/17/tim-cook-thoughts-on-privacy/">improved security</a>.</p>
