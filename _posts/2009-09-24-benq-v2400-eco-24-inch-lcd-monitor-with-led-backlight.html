<p><strong>LED Advantage</strong> The LED backlight has a several advantages over the typical CCFL backlight. First, when lit from the edges it allows for very slim designs. The second advantage is that it does not contain mercury, a poisonous substance. An edge-lit LED backlight isn't going generate the type of front-screen performance compared to a direct-lit LED backlight, but it should be on par with a good LCD monitor with a CCFL backlight. Another advantage is that it consume less power, about 30% less, at just 28W. <a id="more"></a><a id="more-7166"></a></p>
<p><strong>Fluff</strong> BenQ claims a 5,000,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio. I call that marketing fluff. Is BenQ claiming that this regular LCD monitor has a better contrast ratio than Sony's OLED TV, the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=xel-1&amp;sa=Search#1348">XEL-1</a>? I think not. The static contrast ratio is a more believable 1000:1.</p>
<p><strong>TN Limitation</strong> Brightness is 250 cd/m2, slightly less than the standard 300. The V2400 Eco's response time is an average 5ms. With a TN LCD panel you can't expect much better than 170/160 viewing angles, though it would be better if they were symmetric; for instance, something 160/160. Although that wouldn't be necessary on the V2400 Eco since you cannot rotate it; the only thing you can do is tilt it up and down by -5 to 20 degrees. Connectivity options include VGA and HDMI (1.3).</p>
<p><strong>Concerns</strong> It would be nice if companies can move away from coining new terms that are not actually true. I foresee massive market confusion about "LED monitors" and thanks to Samsung there is already a lot of that going on for "LED TVs". Another concern I have is the superfluous dynamic contrast ratio numbers: let's get real.</p>
