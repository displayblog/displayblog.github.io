<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/30/dell-inspiron-duo-review/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The swiveling, 10.1-inch, 1366x768-resolution display on the Inspiron Duo is the system's main attraction -- or at least it should be, right? Obviously, we're impressed with the unique convertible form factor, but flat out, the quality of the LCD doesn't match the Duo's top notch industrial design. [...] Now, because the screen vertically rotates, the poor vertical viewing angles are extremely noticeable, and while you're not going to be looking at anything on the screen at an 90-degree angle, even at about 35 degrees colors start to fade and distort.

<p>A cheap, poor performing LCD especially in a tablet is poor product design. And so is the decision to use stock Windows.</p>
