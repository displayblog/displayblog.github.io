<blockquote><p>Terrifying, but you signed up for that... they knew if they worked with Steve it was going to be the most difficult time, and the most difficult challenge... part of his genius was getting people to work above their talents... it could be abusive sometimes... it was about trust, he had a really hard time trusting...</blockquote></p>
<p>The biggest obstacle to attaining perfection is the friction within ourselves. Physical friction is one. We as biological creatures get tired. Mental friction is another and is intimately connected to physical friction. When these frictions generate significant amounts of stress most of us begin to question whether or not attaining perfection is worth all the trouble. Most decide it is not worth the pain. And Steve Jobs did not trust most to keep chugging along until perfection, at least in his eyes, was achieved.</p>
