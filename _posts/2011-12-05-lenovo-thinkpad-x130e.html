<p align="center"><em>via</em> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/12/6/2613946/lenovo-thinkpad-x130es-pricing-release-date">The Verge</a>. Good looks.* 11.6 inches. 1366x768. US$469. Tempting.</p></p>
<p>* Whoever took this shot is most excellent, making the X130e look much thinner than it actually is. The sides of the X130e is unfortunately far from good looking. Not quite as tempting as before.</p>
