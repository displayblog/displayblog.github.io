<blockquote><p>Consider the timeline. As Daniel Dilger documents in a report today for AppleInsider <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/04/14/exclusive-android-docs-reveal-before-iphone-googles-plan-was-a-java-button-phone">looking at Android design documents entered as evidence in the trial</a>, in August 2006, the draft Android 1.0 design document mandated up/down/left/right/select hardware buttons and explicitly stated that touchscreens would not be supported. Then, the very next revision of the specification, in April 2007 &mdash; a draft described as a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;major update&acirc;&euro;¬ù &mdash; multitouch touchscreens became mandatory. In August 2006 Android was planned as a BlackBerry/Windows Mobile style hardware-button platform with no initial support for touchscreens. In April 2007 it became a platform where multitouch touchscreens were mandatory.</blockquote></p>
