<p>Canaccord Genuity analyst T. Michael Walkley, <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/09/06/iphone_4_remains_top_selling_us_smartphone_despite_growing_iphone_5_hype.html">AppleInsider</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our checks indicated strong sales of the iPhone 4, as it remained the top selling smartphone at AT&T and Verizon despite increasing consumer expectations for the iPhone 5 launch.</p>
<p>During the holiday season, we anticipate strong sales of the iPhone 5, as we anticipate a strong global launch with increased distribution to new carriers including Sprint in the U.S. market.</blockquote></p>
<p>This is quite intriguing to me. I would have assumed iPhone 4 sales at AT&T and Verizon would have slowed down enough to have had other smartphones outsell it in August. Because almost everyone is expecting a new iPhone, the iPhone 5 or iPhone 4S or both, to be introduced the very next month. By the way, the second best selling smartphone on AT&T was the iPhone 3GS.</p>
<p>Speaking of Sprint, the best seller was and has been the HTC EVO 3D 4G. On T-Mobile it was the HTC Sensation. If and when the iPhone becomes available on those two carriers there's a good chance the iPhone could become bestsellers.</p>
