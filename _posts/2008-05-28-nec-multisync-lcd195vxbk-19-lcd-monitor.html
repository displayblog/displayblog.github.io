<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=nec">NEC</a>'s MultiSync LCD195VX+BK 19" <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-monitor">LCD monitor</a> isn't anything special in terms of on-screen performance. The LCD195VX+BK has a 5:4 aspect ratio (not wide) with a pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1280-x-1024">1280 x 1024</a>. The other specifications are pretty standard too. But the LCD195VX+BK is unique among NEC LCD monitors. On April 22, 2008, NEC Display Solutions of America announced that its MultiSync LCD195VX+BK LCD monitor (and the smaller LCD175VXM+BK) earned a Gold level Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) rating. This was the first EPEAT Gold rating for NEC Display Solutions. EPEAT has three levels: Bronze, Silver, Gold. There are 23 required criteria that must be met to earn a Bronze level. For Gold status the product must be Energy Star complaint, have a minimum of 65% reusable or recyclable materials and meet 75% of the optional criteria. NEC's LCD195VX+BK (and the LCD175VXM+BK) met 80% of the optional criteria.</p>
<p>This news is more than one month old, but I wanted to reiterate the importance of building high-tech electronics that have less negative impact on the environment. It would have been nice if the LCD195VX+BK consumed even less energy during standby since at least 8 or so hours each day the monitor will be in standby mode. There are currently just 13 monitors that are rated EPEAT Gold. I was pleasantly surprised to see that Lenovo is dominating.</p>

<p>Kudos to NEC for achieving EPEAT Gold status. Here's to hoping that all LCD monitors become more friendly toward the environment and in the process save us a few bucks in electricity bills!</p>
