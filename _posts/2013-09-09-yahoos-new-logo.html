<p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/yahoo-unveils-logo-043439762.html">Yahoo News</a>: Bland. Yahoo ripped out all the spice from its 18-year old logo and made it utterly bland.</p>
<p><a href="http://marissamayr.tumblr.com/">Marissa Mayer</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We wanted there to be a mathematical consistency to the logo, really pulling it together into one coherent mark.</blockquote></p>
<p>I like mathematically consistent fonts. <a href="http://quoteunquoteapps.com/courierprime/">Courier Prime</a> is my default font for writing emails and notes on my Mac. I prefer monotype fonts because they perform exactly as expected. But Yahoo's new logo is anything but mathematically consistent.</p>
<p>I'm not a typographer; I'm just a regular guy who knows what he likes and what he doesn't like. And I don't like Yahoo's new logo. For a logo that is purported to be mathematically consistent, there seems to be way too many font sizes. In my unprofessional eyes, the letters are both too close to another and inconsistently kerned. For example, the exclamation mark seems to be off to the right a bit too much, but the first 'O' seems to be too close to the 'H'. Again, I'm no typography expert and these are just my opinions, but what's more important is the guttural response from looking at a logo. Unfortunately, my gut tells me its like drinking a cup of lukewarm, bland, day-old coffee.</p>
