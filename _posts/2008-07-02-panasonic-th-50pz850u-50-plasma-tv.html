<p>"Mirror mirror on the wall, which plasma is the best of all?" The mirror will be confused. Why? The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=panasonic">Panasonic</a> TH-50PZ850U is one of the best in terms of color and detail. But when it comes to black levels, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=pioneer">Pioneer</a>'s KURO is the best.</p>
<p>HD Guru did some extensive tests to see how good Panasonic's TH-50PZ850U really is. When the TH-50PZ850U is in Digital Cinema Color mode, green was greener and red was more crimson, more so than any other plasma that HD Guru has seen. Better than the Pioneer KURO PDP-6010FD. The Pioneer KURO did take the black level crown. But that is because Pioneer uses a darker tinted coating over the front of the panel. This can result in deep dark details getting lost in the tint. The Panasonic TH-50PZ850U, on the other hand, provided clearer details in dark scenese. So, for home theater applications that allow total darkness, the KURO would be the choice. But with average homes that don't have a dedicated home theater, the Panasonic shines.</p>
<p>Finally, in regards to color, the Panasonic 50" displays greens and reds that are more natural, more natural than the Pioneer. Blue representations are equally good on both units, but overall Panasonic takes it.</p>
