<p><strong> </strong><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20100412PR202.html">Sharp Develops 4 Primary Color 3D LCD</a>: Based on the time-sequential technique where the left and right eyes are shown different content through active-shutter 3D glasses resulting in a 3D effect. Sharp improves upon conventional 3D displays by increasing brightness by 1.8x and reducing crosstalk leading to a significant decrease of double-contour ghost images. Sharp combined many of its technologies: UV2A (read <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/09/17/sharp-uv2a-technology/"><em>Sharp UV2A Technology</em></a>), four primary color (Red, Green, Blue and Yellow), FRED (Frame Rate Enhanced Driving), edge-lite LED backlight. The four primary color technology improves light transmission efficiency and allows for a wider color gamut.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20100412PD220.html">PVI March Revenues Increase 19% M/M</a>: Prime View International's March consolidated revenues increased 19% M/M and 94% Y/Y to NT$1.87 billion (about US$59 million) and includes results from E Ink and Hydis. First quarter revenues were NT$5.01 billion. PVI supplies E Ink-based e-book displays to Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, Sony and others. The company expects to maintain its leadership as the largest e-paper supplier in 2010. With the advent of Apple's iPad, I am not certain that E Ink-based e-book readers will continue to enjoy rapid growth.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20100412PD205.html">Chimei Innolux Announces March Revenues and Shipments</a>: Chimei Innolux (CMI) announced unaudited consolidated revenues of NT$38.38 billion (about US$1.22 billion), 9.81 million large-area and 25.31 million small/medium LCD panel shipments for the month of March. These results exclude results from Chi Mei Optoelectronics (CMO) and TPO Displays prior to the merger date, which was on March 18, 2010. CMI's results do include LCD panels, LCD modules and LCD systems.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20100409PD217.html">Corning Taiwan Running at Full Capacity</a>: Corning Taiwan's glass production is running at full capacity to meet customer demand and restore optimal inventory levels. If the LCD TV market continues to grow Corning will consider expanding glass manufacturing capacity including Taiwan's. In 2009, worldwide glass substrate shipments increased 20% Y/Y to 2.45 billion square feet. For 2010, the world's largest LCD glass supplier expects shipment growth of 21% Y/Y to 2.8 to 3.0 billion square feet. Corning also shared that glass supply will be tight throughout 2010. LCD TV share of the global TV market is expected to reach 80% in 2010 and grow to over 90% in 2010 according to the company. Corning's Taichung, Taiwan-based glass facility has been completely recovered from the October 2009 power disruption and currently is running at full capacity. China's LCD TV demand is expected to reach 37 million units in 2010 and capturing 21% of the global LCD TV market. Next year, Corning expects China to become the largest LCD TV market.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20100413PD211.html">Samsung Follows LG Display to Supply Panels Used in iPad</a>: According to Taiwan-based LCD suppliers, Samsung will be the second LCD panel supplier to Apple's iPad program following LG Display (LGD). Samsung's S-PVA (Super Patterned Vertical Alignment) LCD panels will be used. LGD shipped 300,000 - 400,000 9.7-inch IPS LCD panels for the iPad in February and almost 500,000 in March. Sources claim that Samsung's LCD panels meet Apple's requirements. I call B.S. And the main reason being that Apple has made it clear that one of the main features of the iPad is the use of IPS LCDs. I am fairly certain Apple will not be making use of S-PVA LCDs in its iPad.</p>
