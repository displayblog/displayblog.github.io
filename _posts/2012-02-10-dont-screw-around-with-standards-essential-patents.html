<p><a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120210/eu-competition-chief-screw-around-with-standards-essential-patents-and-youll-be-sorry/">EU competition chief Joaquin Almunia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When monopolies and tight oligopolies are allowed to occupy a market, they tend to resist change and often end up caring only about the preservation of their business models. Owners of such standards essential patents are conferred a power on the market that they cannot be allowed to misuse. I am determined to use antitrust enforcement to prevent the misuse of patent rights to the detriment of a vigorous and accessible market. I have initiated investigations on this issue in several sectors and we will see the results in due time.</blockquote></p>
