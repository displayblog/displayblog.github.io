<p><a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/02/04/200-million-workers-want-windows-8-tablets-not-ipads#awesm=~oD3JIMYI3nB9Fa">Mark Hachman, ReadWrite</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Easily the biggest surprise of the report. Of those IT workers polled, only 2% own a Windows tablet. But 32% want one. That tops Apple, with just 26% of those polled wanting an iPad and 12% hoping for another Android tablet.</blockquote></p>
<p>That's what Forrester found after polling 9766 information workers. <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2014/04/30/the-ipad-discontinuity/">Tim Cook</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the enterprise market, we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re seeing virtually all, 98% of the Fortune 500, they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re using iPad.</blockquote></p>
<p>Forrester found 2% of the IT workers polled used Windows tablets. In terms of Fortune 500 companies, guess what the other 98% uses?</p>
