<p>"This firmware update is recommended for all 17-inch MacBook Pro (Early 2009) users and addresses the appearance of vertical lines or distorted graphics on the notebook display."</p>
<p>It is not known exactly what the firmware update does: whether it fixes something with the GeForce 9600M or an overheating problem with the graphics subsystem. It's good news for those who have had to endure some nasty artifacts in an otherwise near-perfect notebook PC.</p>
