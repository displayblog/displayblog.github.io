<p>[ <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/01/standing-desks-may-boost-students-cognitive-function-as-well-as-health/">Ars Technica</a> ] Beth Mole:</p>
<blockquote><p>Following 27 high school freshman over one school year, researchers found that using a standing desk generally improved the kids&rsquo; neurocognitive test scores by seven to 14 percent. The tests, given both at the beginning and end of the school year, evaluated cognitive processes such as reasoning and working memory.</blockquote><br />
Nothing to lose. And just in time: a $25 (+$10 shipping &amp; handling) portable standing desk called <a href="http://oristand.co/">Oristand</a>.</p>

<p>The Oristand is as simple as can be; you don't need to assemble anything and for about 100% of users a manual is not necessary. The Oristand is made with industrial-grade cardboard -- 100% recyclable -- making it both light and strong. The origami-style design makes the Oristand fold flat when you're not using it: when you want to give your back a little break from standing.</p>
