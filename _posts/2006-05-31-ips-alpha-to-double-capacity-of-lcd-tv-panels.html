<p>In the earlier post about IPS Alpha's capacity expansion the focus was on LCD monitor panels. Now it looks like their focus will be on LCD TV panels, and rightly so. LCD monitors are a maturing market and not much is going on except for the sizes getting bigger and wider. The LCD TV market has quite a bit left before it hits adolescence as LCD TV share of the entire TV pie is but a small portion today.</p>
<p>IPS Alpha's production capacity of 32" LCD TV panels will increase to 5 million by 2H'07 according to the company. IPS Alpha is based in the Chiba Prefecture, next to Tokyo.</p>
