<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/live-apple-coo-tim-cook-at-the-goldman-tech-conference-2010-2">Tim Cook</a>, February 23, 2010:</p>
<blockquote><p>We can put all of our products on the table you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re sitting at. Those products together sell $40 billion per year. No other company can make that claim except perhaps an oil company.</p>
<p>We are the most focused company that I know of, or have read of, or have any knowledge of.</p>
<p>We say no to good ideas every day; we say no to great ideas; to keep the number of things we focus on small in number.</blockquote></p>
<p>Simplify, focus, say no, a lot.</p>
