<p><a href="http://www.bgr.com/2010/11/05/zte-peel-hitting-sprint-november-14th-30month-no-contract/">Boy Genius Report</a> &rarr; <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2010/11/05/zte-peel-3g-case-for-ipod-touch-to-launch-on-sprint-november-14th/">MacRumors</a>: Sprint will be launching the ZTE Peel on November 14th. This is big news. Why? The Peel is a case for the iPod touch that gives it 3G. For US$29.99 per month for 1GB of data <em>without</em> a contract you can say adios to AT&T and to the insanely expensive and required voice + data plans for the iPhone. Everything is data so I don't know why we are being forced to pay for voice. I'd rather Skype and save a bunch of money. The Peel also has a five-device mobile hotspot capability.</p>
