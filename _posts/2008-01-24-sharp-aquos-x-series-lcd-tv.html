<p>Sharp Corporation announced its new AQUOS X Series of LCD TVs in three sizes: 37", 42" and 46". According to Sharp, the X Series AQUOS is the industry's thinnest at just 3.44cm (less than 1") in depth at the thinnest part. Thin is definitely in. If you intend to hang one of these X Series LCD TVs on your wall, the more flush it is with the wall, the better it would be aesthetically. I look forward to most high-end LCD TVs to shed thickness this year. What I would like to see in the distant future is a TV that's just pure display with little else.</p>
