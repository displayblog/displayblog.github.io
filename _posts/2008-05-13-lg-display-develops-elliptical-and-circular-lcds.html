<p>On May 14, 2008, LG Display announced the development of the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s largest 6" elliptical and 1.4" circular-shaped LCDs. The 6" elliptical LCD measures 78.8mm in height and is 131.4mm wide, while the 1.4" circular LCD measures 35.5mm in diameter. Both LCDs are capable of displaying up to 262K colors and feature viewing angles of almost 160 degrees. </p>

<p>Potential applications for elliptical and circular-shaped LCDs include automotive, avionics and home electronics instrument panels, mobile phones, watches and gaming devices. LG Display is planning to showcase its elliptical and circular-shaped LCDs at the 2008 Society for Information Display (SID) exhibition in Los Angeles, California from May 18 to 23.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2008.05.24</strong><br />
I got up close and personal with <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lg-display">LG Display</a>'s elliptical LCD during SID 2008 and boy it was interesting. One wacky idea for an elliptical or circular LCD might be to make it a mirror, but a very special mirror: a mirror that takes away all of the wrinkles, discolorations, pimples and only shows a perfect you every time you look into it! Now how's that for an idea!</p>
