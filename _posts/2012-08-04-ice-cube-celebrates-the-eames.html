<p>My favorite quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>You gotta use what you got and make the best of it.</blockquote></p>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote><p>Take something that already exists and making something special.</blockquote></p>
<p>Two quotes, but they are one and the same. When you use what you have, what already exists, and make the best of it it usually ends up being something special.</p>
