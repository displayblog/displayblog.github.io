<p>Leander Kahney, <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/295024/apple-watch-anti-theft/">Cult of Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thanks to sensors on the Apple Watch&acirc;&euro;&trade;s back, the device can tell when it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s being worn and when it has been taken off. When you first put the watch on, you must enter a code. When the watch is removed from your wrist, the watch locks itself and can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be used for payments unless the code is entered again.</blockquote></p>
<p>Guess you can't <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/09/10/apple-watch-jony-ives-team-worked-on-it-for-three-years/">wear the Apple Watch loose</a>?</p>
