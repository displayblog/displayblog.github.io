<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/3/6100933/asus-zenwatch-with-android-wear-launch">The Verge</a>: The IP55-rated ASUS ZenWatch sports a 1.6-inch OLED display with 320x320 pixels protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3, a stainless steel body, and a nicely stitched tan leather strap. Unfortunately the bezels top and bottom are too thick.</p>
<p>The ZenWatch running Android Wear has a few notable features: it measures your relaxation level (heart rate monitor), it finds your smartphone when you double tap the display, and it can automatically unlock your smartphone. Priced at &euro;199 (about US$260).</p>
