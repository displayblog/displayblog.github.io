<p>Eric Schmidt as reported by <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/128664/google-android-was-started-way-before-the-iphone/">Ed Sutherland, Cult of Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think most people would agree Google is a great innovator and I would also point out that the Android effort started before the iPhone effort.</blockquote></p>
<p>I think there should be a * next to "the Android effort". The Android before the iPhone and the Android after the iPhone is drastically different. Schmidt must be referring to the Android effort prior to having knowledge of what the iPhone looked like in terms of hardware and software.</p>
