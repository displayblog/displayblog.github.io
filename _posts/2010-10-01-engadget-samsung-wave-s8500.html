<p><img src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Samsung_Wave_S8500_Bada_Super_AMOLED_Smartphone.jpg" alt="" title="Samsung_Wave_S8500_Bada_Super_AMOLED_Smartphone" width="480" height="450" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12804" /></p>
<p>Samsung's Wave S8500 is a Bada smartphone. Bada is Samsung's smartphone OS much like Android is Google's. The Wave S8500 sports a 3.3-inch "800x480" PenTile Matrix Super AMOLED display. Engadget:</p>
<blockquote><p>The front is made of glass with subtly concave top and bottom edges, covering a 3.3-inch 800 x 480 pixel Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen which looks absolutely gorgeous and remains visible in direct sunlight.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Bada smartphone features a 5 megapixel camera with autofocus, macro and a LED flash. You can capture 720/30p HD video but it doesn't autofocus while in video mode, something most smartphones lack right now.</p>
<blockquote><p>Shots contain sufficient detail and exhibit accurate color balance and exposure. Low-light performance is surprisingly good, and noise is kept under control. Video recording is silky smooth (30fps sustained), with few compression artifacts and great audio.</blockquote></p>
<p>And what about Bada?</p>
<blockquote><p>The Wave is a lot like a baby Galaxy S. What you lose in screen size and performance, you gain with better materials, build quality, battery life, and camera features (namely an LED flash and a dedicated 2-stage camera button). Bada, surprisingly, behaves a lot like a baby Android. It arguably provides the best feature phone experience currently available, but still leaves us craving for more.</blockquote></p>
<p>Baby Galaxy S? Baby Android? Sounds good.</p>
