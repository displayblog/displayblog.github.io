<p>Melissae Fellet, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/12/efficient-oled-gets-rid-of-heavy-metals/">Ars Technica</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hiroki Uoyama, of Kyushu University in Japan, and colleagues designed a molecule that has a small energy difference between the singlet and triplet excitons. That way, triplet excitons can cross over to an excited singlet state and then relax to emit light.</blockquote></p>
<p>What this means: More affordable than heavy metal-laden phosphorescent OLED with equivalent electricity to light efficiency of 19%.</p>
