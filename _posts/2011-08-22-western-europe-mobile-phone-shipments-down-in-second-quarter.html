<p>Kevin J. O'Brien, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/22/technology/dip-in-mobile-shipments-to-western-europe-causes-concern.html?_r=2&amp;src=tp">The New York Times</a>:</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The euro zone crisis has mobile users hanging on to their phones a little longer.</p></p>
<p>With fewer consumers buying, the Continent&acirc;&euro;&trade;s big mobile retailers have been keeping inventories low, which has brought the first-ever quarterly decline in cellphone shipments in Western Europe, said Gartner, the research firm.</p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>According to Gartner cell phone shipments in Western Europe dropped 0.5% Q/Q to 43.57 million in Q2'11. Mobile retailer inventories have dropped from four to six weeks worth down to three to four.</p></p>
<p>There might be a Nokia effect taking place. <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2011/08/22/nokia-vs-android/">Horace Dediu</a>:</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two years ago Nokia sold 30% of its smartphones in Western Europe. Today it sells 15% in that market. Its unit shipments went from 5 million to about half that and its market share went from 55% to 11%. Its rank in the market went from first to fifth.</p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>Imagine you've been using a Nokia phone for years. Now all of the sudden Nokia is falling off the cliff. What to do? It seems a lot are deciding to do nothing, for the time being.</p></p>
<p>Before the end of the year Nokia plans to release a smartphone running Microsoft's Windows Phone 7 mobile OS. Initial acceptance of WP7 smartphones has been lukewarm in the U.S. What could Nokia do better than existing HTC and Samsung built versions?</p></p>
