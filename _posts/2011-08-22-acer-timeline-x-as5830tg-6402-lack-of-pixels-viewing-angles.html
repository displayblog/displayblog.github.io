<blockquote>
<p>We've been around the block and reviewed enough laptops over the years to know that even among reflective displays, the AS5830's 15.6-inch (1366 x 768) panel is particularly shiny. Have a gander at the gallery above and decide for yourselves, but in our humble opinion, the screen looks cheaper than what you'd find on other systems. As you might expect, that glare translates to uneven viewing angles. On the one hand, we were pleasantly surprised at how much we could see when watching from way off on the side. And yet, if you push the lid forward even slightly, the screen becomes too washed out to really enjoy it. This was true whether we rested the laptop on a table or on our legs. Suffice it to say, fiddling with the display until you stumble on the right angle gets old fast.</p><br />

<p>The Acer Timeline X AS5830TG-6402 sports a 15.6-inch TN LCD with an anemic 1366x768 pixel format. You see this on a <em>11.6-inch</em> MacBook Air. I would think 1440x900 would be the absolute minimum, with 1680x1050 more like it.</p></p>
<p>Then there is the viewing angle problem. Most notebook product managers incorrectly assume vertical viewing angles are not very important. Well, it is: we human beings tend to change our sitting positions when working or playing. Sometimes we shift to the left or right and other times up or down. This particular TN LCD seems to have problems when we go up or down.</p></p>
