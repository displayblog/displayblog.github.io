<p>Joshua Ho, <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/8523/the-new-motorola-moto-x-2014-review/5">AnandTech</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>While AMOLED has traditionally struggled with luminance in situations such as the web browser and light-themed applications, Samsung&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Galaxy S5 and S5 LTE-A Broadband have shown that it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s possible to achieve levels of brightness approaching some of the brightest RGB-stripe LCDs. As the brightness of the Lumia 930 is about equal to the new Moto X, I suspect we're looking at the Galaxy S4/Note 3 generation of panels.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Moto X (2nd Gen, 2014) posted a max brightness of 242 nits on SpectraCal CalMAN 5. Quite low.</p>
<blockquote><p>Contrast is still incredible, but I can still see the purple smearing effect that comes from unlit to lit pixels.</blockquote></p>
<p>Not good.</p>
<blockquote><p>We see that the display is just a bit too red, and that most of the luminance is coming from red and green.</blockquote></p>
<p>Display lifetime and battery life were more important than color accuracy.</p>
<blockquote><p>There&acirc;&euro;&trade;s really not much that the Moto X can accurately display in sRGB as just by pushing the gamut too far, even if there wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t saturation compression for some colors, the large gamut will cause distortion of all colors within the gamut triangle.</blockquote></p>
<p>Terrible.</p>
