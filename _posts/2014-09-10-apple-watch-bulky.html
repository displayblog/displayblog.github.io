<p>Benjamin Clymer, <a href="http://www.hodinkee.com/blog/hodinkee-apple-watch-review">Hodinkee</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If I had to criticize the actual form of the Apple Watch, it would be a complaint you've heard from me before (<a href="http://www.hodinkee.com/features/three-on-three-comparing-affordable-independent-watches">most recently with the Habring2 in our latest Three on Three</a>); the Apple Watch doesn't fit under my shirt cuff without serious effort, if at all. I believe that great design should not disrupt daily life, and a watch that doesn't fit under a shirt sleeve is missing something. Apple is amazing and building thin, elegant machines, and I was surprised by how bulky this is, especially when the 45 minutes prior to the introduction of the Apple Watch were spent discussing how svelte the new iPhone 6 is. I understand the physical limitations and the required dock on the rear of the watch, but the Apple Watch is bulkier than I would've liked.</blockquote></p>
<p>The right way to wear the Apple Watch:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short sleeve shirts (recommended)</li>
<li>Long sleeve shirts with elastic cuffs</li>
<li>Long sleeve button-down shirts with large cuff openings</li>
<li>Long sleeve button-down shirts with sleeve folded up</li>
<li>No shirt</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>There, bulky solved.</p>
