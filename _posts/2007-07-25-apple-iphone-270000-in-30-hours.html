<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/earningsq307/">Apple</a> <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/07/25/apple-sold-270-000-iphones-in-the-first-30-hours/">Engadget</a>: The third quarter for Apple ended June 30, just 30 hours after the iPhone became available to the public. And in those 30 hours 270,000 iPhones were sold. That's fantastic! A simple calculation results in revenues ranging from $135 million to $162 million. That's $4.5 million to $5.4 million, <em>an hour</em>. Due to activation problems, AT&amp;T reported total iPhone activations at just 146,000 in the same time frame.</p>
<p>My guess is that Apple is on target to hit 10 million units by the end of 2008, but not because of the 9000 iPhone sales per hour in the first 30 hours, but because the iPhone will be available to a few major countries in Q4 of 2007 and to the rest of the 300+ million European market in 2008. Europe is the largest GSM market, as far as I know. I would think Japan would be getting the iPhone relatively soon too since they too have an established GSM infrastructure with NTT Docomo having the best chance of working with Apple. Though CDMA is stronger in South Korea, GSM networks are available through a couple of service providers: KT Freetel <del datetime="2011-03-14T05:44:03+00:00">and SK Telecom</del>. SK would be the best choice, in my opinion, in working with Apple in Korea.</p>
