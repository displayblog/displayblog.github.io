<p>Some Droid X users seem to be experiencing defective displays. In one video (tc9918: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFqIOmmFQ48&amp;feature=player_embedded">New Droid X Screen/Display Problem</a>) there are grey bars, which is likely the result of defective driver ICs. The other video (raverk7: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRFX0t7cDb4&amp;feature=player_embedded#!">Day 4 with my new Droid X</a>) seems to have a problem with the timing controller (TCON).</p>

FYI: After dealing with quality issues on two Motorola Motoroi Android smartphones I returned it. I'm glad I did. Read <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/07/10/sktelecom-motorola-xt720-motoroi-review-3-7-inch-ips-android-2-1-smartphone-in-south-korea/">my review of the Motoroi</a> for all the details.</p>
