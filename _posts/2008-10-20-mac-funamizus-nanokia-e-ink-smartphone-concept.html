<p>Combine the simple design with touch (multitouch I hope), visual, audio, and haptic feedback and physical keyboards have very little advantage. Try allowing international keyboards on a physical keyboard: nearly impossible and clumsy at best. The bezel-less design looks fantastic. I hope a company would be bold enough to bring something like this to market. Of course I would also hope the OS would be as sexy and most importantly intuitive to use.</p>
