<blockquote><p>I knew it was only a matter of time when Apple would be able to get the technology in the right place before a Retina display would be possible on an iPad. So we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re at that place in 2012 where the right components are available at the right price to make this feasible. That being said, I plan on waiting in line at the Apple store on launch day to get one of these. This is the first iPad where I believe it will be able to replace paper books for me.</blockquote></p>
<p>I can guess how good the iPad Retina display will be, but I'll wait until I see it for myself before I say how good it is. I have a strong preference for hard bound books made with quality paper. Will I continue to have this preference once I take a look at the new iPad? I can't say for sure, but I am certain I will be challenged.</p>
