<p><a href="http://displayblog.wordpress.com/tag/sed/">SED</a>, a new display technology called surface-conduction electron-emitter display, is currently being developed jointly by Toshiba and Canon. The President and CEO of Toshiba, Atsutoshi Nishida, admitted that SED will not be able to compete against LCD technology due to higher manufacturing costs and lower manufacturing capabilities. Nishida stated that SED will be targeted toward the commercial markets. Prior to this, Nishida made a lofty forecast back in 2004 that SED will capture 20-30% of the 50" and larger flat panel TV market. I would guess that would be about 0.2-0.3% now. But not all is lost: Nishida noted that Toshiba is planning to introduce a 50" SED TV in the spring of 2007.
