<p><a href="http://youtu.be/I4Y_JnbaZyk">YouTube</a>: Leaks of the iPhone 6 keep on coming. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/09/01/iphone-6-leaked/">A non-working unit was leaked a few days ago</a>. Now we have a video of a working device. There is little doubt we are looking at the real thing in this video.</p>
<p><a href="http://youtu.be/eUAPHgiEniQ">Here's another video</a>. Tim Cook at AllThingsD D10 in May 2012 (at the 18:58 mark):</p>
