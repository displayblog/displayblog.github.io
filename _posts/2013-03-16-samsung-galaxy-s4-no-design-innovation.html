<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/htc-interview-about-samsung-galaxy-s4-2013-3">Business Insider</a>: President of HTC North America, Mike Woodward:</p>
<blockquote><p>"It feels very iterative. It looks a lot like the Galaxy S III," Woodward said of the GS4. "We were pleased to see no innovation in the design itself."</blockquote></p>
<p>I hate to say it, but for a big chunk of potential smartphone buyers it's about marketing. Samsung's marketing is stupid and at times <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/03/15/samsung-sexist">sexist, even misogynistic</a>, but it is effective in selling. Design innovation is not necessary to sell a lot of smartphones. Unfortunate, but true. Just wait and see, the Samsung Galaxy S4 will outsell the HTC One, and a lot of other better designed smartphones.</p>
