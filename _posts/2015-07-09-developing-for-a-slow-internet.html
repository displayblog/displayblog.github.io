<p><i>via</i> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/07/09/slow-web">John Gruber</a>. <a href="https://medium.com/@zengabor/three-takeaways-for-web-developers-after-two-weeks-of-painfully-slow-internet-9e7f6d47726e">Gabor Lenard</a> was stuck at 32kbps. He learned some things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Test at Snail's Pace: Use Chrome's developer tools and test your website on the GPRS (50kbps) network speed setting.</li>
<li>Custom Fonts: Use sparingly.</li>
<li>Design Offline Capabilities: "Cache content. Queue up outgoing data and actions without blocking the user. Handle conflicts."</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Chrome's developer tools are unparalleled: The ability to test your web-dependent app on different devices is both a time and money saver. I'm currently testing this website at GPRS speeds, and it seems to be loading quickly. One comment about custom fonts: In my opinion, based on the criteria of simplicity and speed, three is max. Two is better. One is best.</p>
<p>According to Akamai Technologies (source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Internet_connection_speeds">Wikipedia</a>) South Korea enjoyed the fastest download data rate of 25.3mbps in 2014, followed by Hong Kong (16.3), and Japan (15.0). The U.S. was #12 with a rate of 11.5mbps. The last (#55) on the list was 1.1mbps. As you can see broadband speeds from #1 to #55 decline rapidly. There are 196 countries in the world today, which probably means most of the other 141 countries experience extremely slow (and likely unreliable) Internet connectivity.</p>
<p>As a student of user experience design, Lenard's lessons are invaluable in developing web-dependent apps that work no matter the speed.</p>
