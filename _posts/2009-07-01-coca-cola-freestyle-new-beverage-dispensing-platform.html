<p>The Coca-Cola Company has a new beverage dispensing machine and it is called Freestyle. Freestyle has a touch sensitive 15.1-inch LCD using <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=capacitive&amp;sa=Search#1528">capacitive</a> technology. So you touch the drink you want and out it comes when you push your glass in. The company chose Zytronic to supply the touch panel for its new Freestyle beverage dispenser. The Freestyle dispenser gives you more than 100 different brands to choose from in a single free-standing unit. Zytronic's ZYBRID is a customized touch sensor that uses the company's Projected Capacitive Technology (PCT) that is made up of ultra-fine capacitors embedded within a pure glass panel. The 15.1-inch LCD is mounted behind a molded polycarbonate full-front facia. Cool.</p>
