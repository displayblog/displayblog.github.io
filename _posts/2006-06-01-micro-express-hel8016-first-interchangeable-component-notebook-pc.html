<p>Micro Express is a system supplier in California and sells the first notebook PC with interchangeable parts. The NBPC is integrated by Compal and has been verified by Intel. Intel has recently introduced the interchangeability inititative. I don't know why this too so long. We have this with desktops, why not NBPCs? It's a good development. Among the things that can be replaced is the LCD. Yeah!</p>
<p>But there is one thing: The ribbons that attach the LCDs to the mainboard of a NBPC is different depending on the pixel format of the LCD. For instance, if the LCD is the regular 1280 x 800 or 1024 x 768 or even a 1680 x 1050, a regular pin connector is sufficient. However at 1920 x 1200 the pin connector is different because of the added data that need to pass through the ribbon. At least, this is what I think. I hope Micro Express solved this problem.</p>
<p>The HEL8016 NBPC comes with a 15.4" 1280 x 800 LCD and if I were to purchase it, I would upgrade the 15.4" to a 1920 x 1200 when I install Vista, around late 2007.</p>
