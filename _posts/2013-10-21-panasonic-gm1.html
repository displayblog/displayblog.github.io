<p><a href="http://petapixel.com/2013/10/17/say-hello-panasonic-gm1-tiny-yet-capable-micro-four-thirds-shooter/">PetaPixel</a>: The Panasonic GM1 is the smallest Micro Four Thirds camera, and is even smaller than the Sony RX100. I'm assuming that's just the GM1 body without a lens, but that's still quite impressive considering the RX100 is pocketable.</p>
<p>I used to get excited about mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras getting smaller and more capable&mdash;I own a NEX-5&mdash;but I think the future in portable cameras isn't a camera at all. The future of small, portable cameras is the smartphone, like the iPhone 5s.</p>
<p>Everyone living and working in the modern world will eventually need a smartphone and for most the smartphone camera will be more than good enough, with features we want to and can actually use like 10fps and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2013/10/20/review-of-the-iphone-5s-120fps-super-slow-motion/">slo-mo</a>.</p>
