<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/22/5925753/hugo-barra-xiaomi-china-interview">Vlad Savov, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Barra is only <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/8/29/4672668/what-is-xiaomi-china-smartphone-hugo-barra-android">a year into his job</a> as leader of Mi's internationalization efforts, but he's already &acirc;&euro;&oelig;sick and tired&acirc;&euro; of hearing his company derided as an <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/15/5719786/xiaomi-mipad-is-a-plastic-ipad-mini-for-android-lovers">Apple copycat</a>. He sees Mi as &acirc;&euro;&oelig;an incredibly innovative company&acirc;&euro; that never stops trying to improve and refine its designs, and the allegations of it copying Apple are &acirc;&euro;&oelig;sweeping sensationalist statements because they have nothing better to talk about.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>Here are some interesting coincidences pulled together from The Verge and <a href="http://www.cultofandroid.com/66569/xiaomi-dont-copy-apple/">Cult of Android</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun wears denim jeans and a black top while making a keynote presentation and at the end puts up a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;one more thing&acirc;&euro; slide.</li>
<li>Xiaomi's Mi 4 smartphone has chamfered edges like the iPhone 5/5s.</li>
<li>Xiaomi's Mi Pad tablet sports the same display as the retina iPad mini with the same aspect ratio, pixel format, and size. The plastic has a very similar design to the iPhone 5c, and with exactly the same colors.</li>
<li>Xiaomi's Mi Box looks like a curved Apple TV.</li>
<li>Xiaomi's Mi Router Mini is very similar to Apple's Magic Trackpad.</li>
<li>Xiaomi's retail stores look like a poor man's replica of Apple Stores.</li>
<li>Xiaomi's Mi 3's camera lens was a copy-paste job of Apple's Aperture icon.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Xiaomi copies, literally. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/07/25/xiaomi-flower">John Gruber</a> wrote about <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/51074875@N06/7005166745/in/gallery-claudio_ar-72157629830598295/">a copyrighted photograph by Javi Inchusta Gonzalez</a> taken with a Nikon D700 SLR on <a href="http://www.mi.com/en/mi3#features">Xiaomi's Mi 3 features page</a>; Xiaomi claims the photo was taken by its Mi 3. And that's not the only photo.</p>
<p>Xiaomi's reputation is well deserved.</p>
