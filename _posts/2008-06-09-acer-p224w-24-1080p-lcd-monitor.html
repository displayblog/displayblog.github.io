<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=acer">Acer</a>'s P224W is the world's first <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=24"">24"</a> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-monitor">LCD monitor</a> touting a pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a>. That's <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a> territory, but we've been hearing about LCD monitors going 16:9 from Samsung for a long time. And now, it's finally here. The line between LCD monitor and LCD TV has been blurred just a bit more, thanks to the birth of the P224W.</p>
<p>The response time is super fast at just 2ms and the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dynamic-contrast">dynamic contrast</a> ratio of 20,000:1 will most likely yield some impressive images. Productivity fans will be slightly disappointed as they will note the loss of 120 horizontal lines of prime LCD real estate. The dual-window setup will result in less information vertically and if you want to full pages to show, you'll need to bring down that zoom to below 100%. Hey, but if you're ever going to watch HD on a monitor, this one will do it for you since you won't be getting any horizontal black bars. Yahoo... </p>
<p>I am sure Acer and others will be touting this as a great step toward the future of LCD monitors where less is more. I won't <em>buy</em> that. If I want to watch HD content, I'll watch it on a proper LCD TV. If I require a smallish LCD TV, I'll get one with a video processing engine that can scale different video sources so they are at least viewable. If there are 30" LCD monitors on a desktop, I can surely imagine a 32" 1080p LCD TV sharing the same space, working overtime as a LCD monitor too.</p>
<p>But, there is a good supply side reason for that is going on. There are two actually. Manufacturing 16:9 LCD panels are a bit cheaper than 16:10. First, there are slightly less pixels to deal with. Although the difference is very small, every little bit counts to increase yields. Second, you can cut more 16:9 LCD panels at many large LCD fabrication plants than 16:10. That means cheaper 24" LCD monitors for you, a good thing.</p>
