<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=eizo">Eizo</a>'s FlexScan HD2452W <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=24"">24"</a> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-monitor">LCD monitor</a> is definitely not targeted for gamers, unlike what has been suggested in a couple of articles. Eizo can't be that clueless. Eizo knows as well as almost anyone in the LCD business that a 16ms response time is not good enough for any games that require quick movements. If you're into Starcraft, no problem. The slow response time suggests the HD2452W is a multitasking LCD monitor that can also be used to watch HD content. So the primary purpose is still work but with the ability to let you view HD when you need to rest. As a LCD monitor the contrast ratio of 1,000:1 is impressive and should provide some good images. Last thing: price. It's too expensive for what it is. Are LCD monitor prices much higher in Japan in general?</p>
