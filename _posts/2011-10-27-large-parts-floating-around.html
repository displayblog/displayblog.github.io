<p><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/27/whats-really-next-for-apple-in-television/">Nick Bilton, The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the time, an individual who has knowledge of Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s prototype supply chains overseas told me they had seen some &acirc;&euro;&oelig;large parts floating around&acirc;&euro; that belonged to Apple. This person believed that it &acirc;&euro;&oelig;looked like the parts could be part of a large Apple television.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>It turns out no iTV is being actively being built. In other words, no prototypes. If Apple is indeed preparing for what I call the iTV then it would be a surprise if Siri wasn't the front-end to "<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/10/21/i-finally-cracked-it/">the simplest user interface you could imagine.</a>"</p>
