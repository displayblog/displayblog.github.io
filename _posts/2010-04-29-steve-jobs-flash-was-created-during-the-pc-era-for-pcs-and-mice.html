<p>And here's the long version as to why Adobe's Flash is wrong for mobile devices. A few points from <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/"><em>Thoughts on Flash</em></a> by Steve Jobs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flash is a closed system, not open and is controlled by Adobe. HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, etc. are open.</li>
<li>Flash is not reliable, not secure and requires an enormous amount of hardware capabilities. "We have routinely asked Adobe to show us Flash performing well on a mobile device, any mobile device, for a few years now. We have never seen it." Steve also mentioned that "Flash is the number on reason Macs crash." And that is the number one reason why Flash needs to get my permission to run every time.</li>
<li>Flash is based on mouse input. So in a smartphone world where the finger replaces the mouse most applications will need to be rewritten. Steve makes it clear: "If developers need to rewrite their Flash websites, why not use modern technologies like HTML5, CSS and JavaScript?"</li>
<li>Dependence on Adobe is bad. Here's Steve again: "If developers grow dependent on third party development libraries and tools, they can only take advantage of platform enhancements if and when the third party chooses to adopt the new features."</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p><a href="http://gartenblog.net/2010/04/29/my-thoughts-on-flash-and-apple/">Michael Gartenberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like Steve, I have not seen Flash work on a mobile device. That doesn't mean that it can't or won't. Adobe needs to not respond to Apple with words but rather actions and showcase shipping devices and how well they can run Flash.</blockquote><br />
Ditto.</p>
