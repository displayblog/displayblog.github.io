<p>Brad Molen, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/08/27/htc-one-m8-windows-review/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The software giant has buddied up with HTC to convert the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/03/25/htc-one-2014-review/">One M8</a>, its Android flagship, into a Windows Phone. That's all there is to it. There's absolutely no change to the hardware -- and it's a fantastic idea.</blockquote></p>
<p>As long as smartphone hardware manufacturers, like HTC, design smartphone hardware so either Android or Windows Phone can run, a bit of power might trickle back to them during negotiations with Google and Microsoft. Wouldn't it be interesting if Samsung decided to launch Windows Phone editions of its Galaxy S5 and the upcoming Galaxy Note 4...</p>
