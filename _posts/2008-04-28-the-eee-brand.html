<p>DigiTimes is reporting that Asustek Computer might be making Eee an independent brand. The Eee brand would include the Eee notebook PC and others such as Eee branded TVs (E-TV), desktop PCs (E-DT) and monitors. With or without independence these products are slated for release in Q3'08.</p>

<p>Easy to pay.</p>
<p>Any and all brands want to shift from low-end to high-end, but if you've got the know-how of making money at the low-end, there is no shame in focusing on that market segment. The Eee PC is known for cool low-cost products. I like that and I hope Asustek continue in that tradition. There are two Eee PC notebooks in the pipeline: Eee PC 900 and Eee PC 1001.</p>
