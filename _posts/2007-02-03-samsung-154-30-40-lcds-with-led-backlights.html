<p>Samsung showcased 15.4", 30" and 40" LCDs with LED backlights during the International Conference and Exhibition on Display LEDs. The 15.4" is a notebook PC LCD with a 1440 x 900 pixel format, the exact pixel format that is in the 15.4" Apple MacBook Pro. So, expect a 15.4" MacBook Pro to have LED backlights very soon in the future.</p>
<p>The 30" LCD has a 2560 x 1600 pixel format with a LED backlight. And interesting enough the 30" LCD monitor offerings from Dell, Apple, HP and a couple of others all have the same pixel format. The LED-based 30" LCD has a brightness of 300 cd/m2, response time of 6ms, viewing angles of 180 degrees, a constrast ratio of 900:1 and a color gamut of 111% NTSC. Although Dell introduced a color gamut-enhanced version of its 30" LCD monitor, HP and Apple hasn't refreshed their 30" monsters yet. So, expect at least one of the two to announce an improved LED-backlit 30" LCD monitor in the near future.</p>
<p>Finally, we get to Samsung's 40" LCD with a LED backlight. The pixel format is an unflattering 1366 x 768 and at an aspect ratio of 16:9 puts it in the LCD TV panel category. The 40" sports a brightness of 500 cd/m2, viewing angles of 180 degrees (really?), a contrast ratio of 100,000:1 via some intelligence that dims the backlight for dark areas. Who cares about a 40" LCD TV with only 1366 x 768. I don't care if it has all the technology in the world. Give me one with Full HD 1080p capability with a pixel format of 1920 x 1080, a LED backlight, 120Hz frequency, over drive circuitry, black frame insertion, local dimming, optically compensated bend liquid crystals and a $999 price.</p>
