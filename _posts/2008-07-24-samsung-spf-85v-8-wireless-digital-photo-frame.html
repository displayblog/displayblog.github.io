<p><a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/consumer/detail/detail.do?group=computersperipherals&amp;type=monitors&amp;subtype=lcd_photoframe&amp;model_cd=LP08CBQSBT/ZA">Samsung</a>: With the Samsung SPF-85V digital photo frame you can transfer photos from your PC wirelessly. The SPF-85V is optimized with Windows Live Spaces for sharing photos easily. Windows Live Spaces? Um, how about Picasa or Flickr or Smugmug? The 8-inch digital photo frame has a 4:3 aspect ratio, quite unique in the land that is shifting rapidly to wide. But I like the 4:3 aspect ratio since most digital cameras don't shoot wide, so pictures will fit better on this squarish SPF-85V.</p>
<p>Aside from its wireless feature and 4:3 screen, the SPF-85V has another feature up its sleeve. If you want to use the SPF-85V as a secondary monitor, you can do that. Just connect it via a USB cable to and from your PC and voila! it is now a tiny secondary monitor thanks to Samsung's UbiSync technology.</p>
<p>The overall design is simple and sleek with necessary buttons easy to access (for right handed folks). With wireless and UbiSync capabilities, the SPF-85V is quite usable as a digital photo frame and small secondary display.</p>
