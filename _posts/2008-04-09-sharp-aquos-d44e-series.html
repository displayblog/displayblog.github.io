On April 9, 2008, Sharp introduced its AQUOS D44E Series LCD TVs. The D44E Series is aimed at consumers who want to upgrade to a LCD TV but is on a tighter budget. Aside from the very decent contrast ratio, the rest of the specifications are unspectacular but decent enough and is an affordable ticket into the world of LCD TV and HD. However, it does seem the prices in the UK are a bit more expensive relative to those in the US. I would expect a decent 32" LCD TV offering in the US to be priced in the range of US$700-$800 at the moment. By Q4'08, I expect those prices to fall to around US$500-$600 levels.<br />
