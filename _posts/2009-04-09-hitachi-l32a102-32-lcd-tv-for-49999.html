And unfortunately it's high price. But this L32A102 model seems to be the contrary. It has all the standard features of a <a href="http://www.google.com/custom?hl=en&amp;safe=active&amp;client=pub-1028052232505250&amp;channel=0117441043&amp;cof=FORID%3A13%3BAH%3Aleft%3BS%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.displayblog.com%3BCX%3ADisplayBlog%2520Search%2520Engine%3BL%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.displayblog.com%2Fwp-content%2Fthemes%2FProSense-Grey%2Fimages%2Fdisplayblog_logo_03_thin.jpg%3BLH%3A50%3BLC%3A%230000ff%3BVLC%3A%23663399%3BGFNT%3A%230000ff%3BGIMP%3A%230000ff%3BDIV%3A%23336699%3B&amp;adkw=AELymgVUZJwQ7X6mM3E476GZ4RxjWS6zESU29_eql9iSOwe-OjL5DBOC6rNdr1Ziflak7067WX1vWfr4blM9rqOQFAVxfFXZA0IMf-bipFMfqAGPmC0pYM3zhn9AdME7Iiha3ksj2P9DpnSsZTFq7uL26Rpzsv-B2Y5tEPrDEnxZjTMP2HjAgH-kfesBza-h7gL_QHQQauZS5zS8pP8z5rhQbX3qjtB2Nw&amp;boostcse=0&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;oe=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=32%22+lcd+tv&amp;btnG=Search&amp;cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3Autpr0mvi0e9">32" LCD TV</a> such as a 1366 x 768 pixel format, a very bright 500 cd/m2, a good number of ports and it's a solid brand.
