<p>Samsung's new mobile phone displays use LED-based backlights that improve brightness by about 33% to 360 cd/m2 vs. conventional displays that top out at 270 cd/m2. Samsung was able to improve the brightness by making the LED chip package itself more bright.</p>

<p>On the right is the newly enhanced LED-backlight mobile display that uses a 1.7cd LED resulting in higher brightness. We use mobile phones all over the place and my RAZR's screen almost disappears in bright sunlight and makes it almost impossible to read. Brighter phone displays like this will make it more useable especially in high-ambient surroundings.</p>
