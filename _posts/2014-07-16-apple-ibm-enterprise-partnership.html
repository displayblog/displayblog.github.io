<p><a href="http://recode.net/2014/07/15/apple-and-ibm-team-up-to-push-ios-in-the-enterprise/">Arik Hesseldahl, Re/code</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;If you were building a puzzle, they would fit nicely together with no overlap,&acirc;&euro; Cook said of the relationship. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;We do not compete on anything. And when you do that you end up with something better than either of you could produce yourself.&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>Calling Apple the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;gold standard for consumers,&acirc;&euro; Rometty said the team-up will allow the two giants to address significant opportunities facing large businesses. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;We will get to remake professions and unlock value that companies don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t yet have,&acirc;&euro; she said. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;We&acirc;&euro;&trade;re addressing serious issues that before this had been inhibiting deployment of wireless in the enterprise.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>Instead of building a new division at Apple geared toward selling to and supporting enterprise customers, Apple teamed up with IBM. I'm glad Cook knows what Apple is:</p>
<blockquote><p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;We&acirc;&euro;&trade;re good at building a simple experience and in building devices,&acirc;&euro; Cook said. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;The kind of deep industry expertise you would need to really transform the enterprise isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t in our DNA. But it is in IBM&acirc;&euro;&trade;s.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>If Apple was a company that went after its competitors head on this enterprise partnership with IBM is a move toward penetrating Microsoft's and Blackberry's strongholds.</p>
