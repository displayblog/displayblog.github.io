<p>According to cheaa.com via <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20100713PB200.html">Digitimes</a>, TPV Technology will reportedly take over Royal Philips Electronics' LCD TV business. An already-drafted agreement will give TPV the rights to use the Philips brand in its TV products along with LCD TV-related patent rights, inventories, customers and employees. Read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/04/16/philips-opts-out-of-lcd-tv-business-funai-takes-over/">Philips Opts Out of LCD TV Business, Funai Takes Over</a></em> where Philips licensed its brand to Funai for the North American LCD TV market.
