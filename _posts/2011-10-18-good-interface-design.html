<p><a href="http://william.gibson.usesthis.com/">William Gibson</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Good interface design is as transparent as possible, because I don't want to have to think about it. I just want to write, or do whatever else I'm doing, and not have to think about whatever I'm doing it on.</blockquote></p>
