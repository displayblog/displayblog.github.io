<p>There have been lots of articles and discussions about how beautiful and stunning the display on the Nexus One looks, but nobody has yet done anything more than superficial eye ball commentary. Next week we begin a comprehensive multi-part article series with in-depth measurements and analysis for the displays on the Google Nexus One and the Apple iPhone 3GS.</p>
<p>It is being produced as a collaboration between DisplayBlog and <a href="http://www.displaymate.com/db">DisplayMate Technologies</a>. We will show you the good, the bad, and also the ugly unfinished rough edges and problems lurking below the surface of each display system. Each article will be introduced and discussed on DisplayBlog by me, Jin Kim, followed up with a detailed technical analysis and measurement data by Dr. Raymond Soneira on the DisplayMate website.</p>
<p>There will be three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Part I: Google Nexus One (Part <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/02/22/display-showdown-part-ia-nexus-one/">Ia</a>, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/02/24/display-showdown-part-ib-nexus-one/">Ib</a>, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/03/01/display-showdown-part-ic-nexus-one/">Ic</a>, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/03/01/display-showdown-part-id-nexus-one/">Id</a>)</li>
<li>Part II: Apple iPhone 3GS (Part <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/02/23/display-showdown-part-iia-iphone-3gs/">IIa</a>, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/02/25/display-showdown-part-iib-iphone-3gs/">IIb</a>, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/03/01/display-showdown-part-iic-iphone-3gs/">IIc</a>, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/03/02/display-showdown-part-iid-iphone-3gs/">IId</a>)</li>
