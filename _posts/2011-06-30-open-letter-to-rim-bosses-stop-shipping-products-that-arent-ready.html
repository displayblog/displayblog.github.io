<p>Senior RIM executive <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.bgr.com/2011/06/30/open-letter-to-blackberry-bosses-senior-rim-exec-tells-all-as-company-crumbles-around-him/">BGR</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>On that note, we simply must stop shipping incomplete products that aren&acirc;&euro;&trade;t ready for the end user. It is hurting our brand tremendously. It takes guts to not allow a product to launch that may be 90% ready with a quarter end in sight, but it will pay off in the long term.</blockquote></p>
