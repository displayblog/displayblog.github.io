The Dell 2408WFP replaces the very excellent (but slightly high-priced, for Dell) 2407WFP-HC. Almost everything is the same except for the improved contrast ratio and the addition of a DisplayPort input. Oh, there is one additional DVI input for a total of two. Contrast ratio has improved from 1000:1 in the 2407WFP-HC to 1300:1 in the 2408WFP. I'm not sure what the advantage of having DisplayPort as the new connection allows for higher video data bandwidth. However, DVI (single-link) is more than capable of driving a LCD display with 1920 x 1200 pixels. Additionally, my computers (PC &amp; Mac) do not have DisplayPort interfaces and I don't see why I would need one in the near future.</p>
<p>
I am not completely sure what type of panel it is using, but I would guess either a S-IPS or PVA panel. I am leaning toward that it is a S-IPS panel since Dell has had used S-IPS panels for its high-end monitors. It is certainly not a TN panel since this model exhibits excellent viewing angles of 178 degrees.<br />

The price for the 2407WFP-HC was $699. You will need to pay $49 more for the 2408WFP. Not that much, but if you don't need that additional DVI, DisplayPort or a slightly improved contrast ratio, then maybe it would be wise to wait for 2407WFP-HC prices to fall and then snatch it before inventory runs out.<br />

<i>Update 2008.04.13</i><br /><br />
I just checked the price of the 2408WFP and it has fallen to $599. That's a drop of $149 in just 3 months. But even with that drop, there are potent competitors out there for $100 less. Take for instance Samsung's <a href="http://displayblog.wordpress.com/2008/01/16/samsung-syncmaster-2493hm-24-lcd-monitor-with-hdmi/">2493HM</a>. Although it sports a TN LCD panel, the 10,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio is great (according to <a href="http://www.overclockersonline.net/?page=articles&amp;num=1631">Overclocker's Online</a>) and a quick check on <a href="http://computers.pricegrabber.com/flat-panel-lcd-monitors/m/61941199/search=samsung%202493hm/st=sort/sort_type=price">Pricegrabber</a> reveals you can purchase the 2493HM at a decent price of around $480, shipping and tax would be extra. For those that need a fast LCD monitor for gaming and do not care too much about viewing angles (since you'll be the only one using it) or color fidelity, the 2493HM might be a good choice. Of course, the 2408WFP is still one of the better choices out there for those who require excellent viewing angles and color fidelity on a 24" LCD monitor.<br />

Dell is also putting DisplayPort into a lot of its new notebook PCs. If Dell continues to incorporate DisplayPort, I believe DisplayPort can be a strong contender to become the next generation connection for IT devices. But there is HDMI coming from the CE domain and you can't count out DVI just yet.<br />
