<p>XBox 360 does not have a HDMI port? I didn't know that. HD-DVD it does not have either. I knew that. Now, for $200, you can purchased the external HD-DVD drive that's about 60-70% the size of the XBox 360 itself and watch HD-DVD movies... ummm... the few that are available. Actually, I Googled "hd-dvd movie" and found the official HD-DVD pimp site: <a href="http://www.thelookandsoundofperfect.com">www.thelookandsoundofperfect.com</a>.<br />
In that site, it says there are 73 HD-DVD titles in stores now!!! The Italian Job and Swordfish sound like good starts. Hey, maybe the $200 external HD-DVD player is worth getting, even though it looks horrible. But not really. You have to watch HD-DVD movies via the Xbox 360's component output. Who was the genius behind that design??? Microsoft should have simply integrated HD-DVD into the main box. That would have been a much simpler and more elegant solution. But 'simple' and 'elegant' is not something Microsoft is about--maybe Apple, but definitely not Microsoft.</p>
<p>Apple iPlay.  Now that's an idea!!! If Apple does something like that, I'm sure it'll be quite fun to watch: Microsoft vs. Sony vs. Nintendo vs. Apple. I bet on Apple and Sony to go to the championship battle while Microsoft and Nintendo fight for #3.</p>

<p>I found this picture at Fred Manteghian Blog and he is pretty harsh on the add-on: "The sign in front of the unit summarizes my thoughts on the subject succinctly." Ouch.</p>
