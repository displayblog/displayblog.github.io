<blockquote><p>The Apple of 15 years ago was just as controlling, arrogant, and likely to overuse the word &acirc;&euro;&oelig;magical&acirc;&euro;¬ù in advertising as the Apple of today, but <em>now</em>, they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re claiming they effectively reinvented the smartphone market and the tablet market. This is infuriating not because it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s transparent bullshit, but because it <em>isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t</em>: they have a pretty good case for those claims.</blockquote></p>
