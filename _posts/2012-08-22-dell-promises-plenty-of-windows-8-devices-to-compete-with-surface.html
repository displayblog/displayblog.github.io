<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/22/3259661/dell-windows-8-ultrabooks-tablets-converged-devices">The Verge</a>: Dell CFO and SVP Brian Gladden:</p>
<blockquote><p>You'll see new Windows 8 ultrabooks, all-in-one tablets and converged devices in the fourth quarter and headed into next year.</blockquote></p>
