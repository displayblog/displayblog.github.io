<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/11/21/samsung-galaxy-tab-7-0-plus-review/">Tim Stevens, Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>While the Galaxy Tab 8.9, the increasingly mythical 7.7 and even the Galaxy Note manage to offer the full 1280 x 800 resolution offered by the big boy 10.1, the 7.0 Plus sadly is asked to make do with a measly 1024 x 600. That's the same as the original Galaxy Tab and, while we wish this device had the resolution to match its bigger (and even smaller) siblings, it is otherwise a very nice display. Colors are rich and bright, contrast is good and, while it can't quite deliver the sort of mouth-watering saturation that the company's Super AMOLED Plus panels can manage, color reproduction seems to be spot-on.</blockquote></p>
<p>The display is already wide (16:9 or 16:10) and all these folks are pushing video, HD video. So I'm wondering why Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Samsung and others don't have the balls to spend a little extra for 1280x800 on a 7-inch tablet and offer a much better overall user experience.</p>
