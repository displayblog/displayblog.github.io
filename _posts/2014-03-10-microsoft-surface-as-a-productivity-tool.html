<blockquote><p>In the end, I really, really like Metro, but don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t love Windows as a whole. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s flawed. But even so, I like my Surface a lot more than I ever liked any of my iPads.</p>
<p>When Apple introduced the iPad, they made a point of showing productivity apps. I feel like the Surface finally makes good on Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s promise: Metro is a UI that actually <em>works</em> well for productivity. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not perfect, but it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s more than acceptable.</blockquote></p>
<p>It's not surprising to me that a full blown Windows 8 tablet is a more capable productivity tool than the iPad. What I'm interested to see is when Microsoft Surface becomes a better productivity tool than a notebook.</p>
<p>As CPUs and GPUs become more powerful and energy efficient, and as battery technology becomes more efficient, there will come a point where a desktop operating system on a tablet will work just fine and for many hours. We're not quite there yet and so a mobile device (iPad) with a mobile operating system (iOS) and a mobile CPU (A7) is faster, more efficient, and lasts longer. But I think in a year or two Microsoft Surface might be able to fulfill the company's original goal of being a single mobile device that is powerful enough to replace a notebook and thin, light, and lasts long enough to be used as a tablet.</p>
