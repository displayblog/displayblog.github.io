<blockquote><p>One of the magazines now available in the iPad App Store is <em>Esquire</em>. [...] it is beautifully typeset and laid out, with very high quality photographs, graphics and advertising, and it's a great demonstration of what you can do.</p>
<p>It was created with HTML 5 &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; not JPEG and Flash pages &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; and is about a sixth of the size of the issue of <em>Wired</em> which I reviewed in my earlier post. It's highly readable. It looks beautiful. [...]</blockquote></p>
