<p><a href="http://craigmod.com/journal/14mm/">Craig Mod</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Panasonic 14MM F/2.5 for micro four thirds systems is a great companion to the GF1 (or the Panasonic GF2 when it comes out). It's a lovely, sharp, whisper quiet, quick to focus, unbelievably tiny, beautiful little prime lens. I highly recommend it. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not perfect for low-light, handheld indoor shooting (the 20MM F/1.7&acirc;&euro;&tilde;s speed is handy there).</blockquote></p>
<p>As always, a must-read, for anyone interested in prime lens photography.</p>
