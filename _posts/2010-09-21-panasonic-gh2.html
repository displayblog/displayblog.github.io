<p>The rumor (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/09/18/rumor-panasonic-gh2/">Rumor: Panasonic GH2</a>) is true and with all the details: 16MP Live MOS image sensor, SD/SDHC/SDXC, Micro Four Thirds mount, 23-point autofocus, face detection, ISO range from 160 to 12800, 3-inch LCD, mini-HDMI out, USB 2.0, 1080/60i (1080/24p @24Mbps too) movie capture. </p>

<p>With Panasonic's new 3D lens, the H-FT012, the GH2 is able to capture 3D images. You'll need a 3D display to see them and Panasonic's got the entire 3D Viera line of TVs for just that. The G2 is slated to become compatible with the H-FT012. Priced at US$900 for just the body. The $999.95 kit includes a 14-42mm lens and if you want the 14-140mm kit lens the price jumps to $1499.95.
