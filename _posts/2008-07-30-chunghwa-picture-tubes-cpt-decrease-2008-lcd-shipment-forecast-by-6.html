<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=chunhwa-picture-tubes">Chunghwa Picture Tubes</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=cpt">CPT</a>), the third largest LCD manufacturer in Taiwan, announced that it has decreased its large-area LCD shipment forecasts for 2008 by 6%. The reduction in its goal for the year is in response to weaker-than-expected demand for LCD panels.  Here is the breakdown by large-area LCD application:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-monitor">LCD Monitor</a> Panels: Original goal 19.2M (9.5M 1H'08, 9.7M 2H'08) --> 17.9M (9.4M, 8.5M). This is a reduction of 6.77%.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=notebook-pc">Notebook PC</a> Panels: Original goal 6.8M (3M 1H'08, 3.8M 2H'08) --> 6.1M (2.9M, 3.2). This is reduction of 10.29%.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a> Panels: Original goal 2.7M (1.4M 1H'08, 1.3M 2H'08) --> 2.9M (1.4M, 1.5M). This is an increase of 7.4%.</li><br />
</ul><br />
CPT has also reduced its fab utilization rates by 10%, similar to <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/07/28/lg-display-to-reduce-lcd-production-by-10/">LG Display</a> and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/07/17/chi-mei-optoelectronics-cmo-cuts-lcd-production-by-10/">Chi Mei Optoelectronics (CMO)</a> and AU Optronics (AUO), for the short-term and only until the end of August. Clearly CPT is expecting the second half of the year to experience a rebound in demand for LCD TVs. This is questionable as even <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sony">Sony</a> has mentioned that it has a cautious outlook for the rest of the year. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/07/29/sony-fyq108-electronics-inventory-increase-to-over-1-trillion-yen/">Sony maintained its LCD TV forecast of 17M units for 2008 in its latest earnings report</a>.</p>
