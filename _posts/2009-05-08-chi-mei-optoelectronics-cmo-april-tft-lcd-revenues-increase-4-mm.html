<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=chi+mei+optoelectronics&amp;sa=Search#1734">Chi Mei Optoelectronics</a> (CMO) reported April 2009 revenues on May 8, 2009. CMO's combined TFT LCD revenues increased 3.6% M/M but down 38.9% Y/Y to NT$20.5 billion in April. The company's large-sized LCD panel shipments decreased 1% M/M and 10.6% Y/Y to 5.6 million units. On the other hand, CMO's small/medium LCD panel shipments grew a significant 14.4% M/M and 30.2% M/M to 11.9 million units.</p>
<p><strong>Larger Sizes?</strong> The M/M revenue growth is good news for CMO despite a decrease in large-size LCD panel shipments. I can't be certain unless I take a look at the company's LCD size shares but it seems the company has focused on larger LCD panels that generate more revenue and giving up on sheer number of units. If this is indeed the case, I think CMO is headed in the right direction to reap more revenues in the months ahead.</p>
