<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://www.fiercewireless.com/story/us-cellular-well-wait-lte-iphone/2011-12-05">FierceWireless</a>. TDS (the US Cellular parent company) CEO Ted Carlson:</p>
<blockquote><p>We're never going to say never about the iPhone. The iPhone for us would need to be at the cutting edge of where we're going, and then there might be an opportunity to consider it.</blockquote></p>
<p>Sounds remarkably arrogant, but where exactly is the sixth-largest U.S. wireless carrier going? LTE in 26 states. I see, Carlson wants LTE smartphones. That makes sense, but this is the same company that turned down Apple due to unacceptable risk and profitability. I'm not certain U.S. Cellular will be given another opportunity.</p>
