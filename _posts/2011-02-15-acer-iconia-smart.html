<blockquote><p>The screen is 4.8 inches and 1024&Atilde;&mdash;480. Really now.</blockquote></p>
<p>Yes, really. That's a 21:9 aspect ratio, similar to the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/03/12/philips-cinema-219-lcd-panel-supplied-by-sharp/">21:9 TVs from Philips</a>. This isn't the first time a mobile phone brand has incorporated this particular ultra-wide aspect ratio. That honor would go to LG for its <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/07/29/lg-bl40-new-chocolate-219-ultrawide-black-label-lg-phone/">BL40 New Chocolate</a>. Even Toyota has fitted a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/12/02/2011-toyota-sienna-219-lcd/">21:9 display in its Sienna</a>. So this isn't anything new. Now, a 21:9 display has certain expectations that go with it. Foremost is the expectation that watching feature films will be most excellent, at least better than the regular 16:9 smartphones out there.</p>
<p>The 1024x480 pixel format leads to a resolution of almost 236PPI, so that's a very good start. The high resolution will certainly lead to both sharp and smooth images in movies. Most movies that come in DVDs aren't 16:9 but wider. You've most likely noticed that there are black horizontal bars while watching DVDs even on your 16:9 HDTV. That's why. On the Acer Iconia Smart you should have no horizontal bars and that's a major plus. You won't have to double-tap on the display to fill the screen. On the flip side, there are a lot of TV content that <em>is</em> formatted 16:9. In this case the regular smartphones will look better with the Iconia Smart having <em>vertical</em> black bars!</p>
<p>The Acer Iconia Smart with its ultra-wide 21:9 4.8-inch LCD will be superb when watching feature films, but not so much when watching TV content in HD. I hope Acer saw it fit to use an IPS LCD to make the point clear that the Iconia Smart was designed for discerning on-the-go movie buffs. You guys do exist, right?</p>
