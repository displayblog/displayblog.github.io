<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/29/3568152/htc-windows-phone-8x-review">The Verge</a>: The HTC Windows Phone 8X sports a 4.3-inch 1280x720 Super LCD 2 that's optically laminated to the Corning Gorilla Glass 2 cover glass. One knock on an otherwise superb display is black levels, which is important for a smartphone running Windows Phone since the OS is dominated by black. A 1280x720 Super AMOLED Plus display might have been a better choice. Blacks would have been completely black, and typography beautiful on the RGB stripe sub-pixel structure.</p>
<p>The 342-ppi resolution LCD beats the iPhone 5, but the HTC Windows Phone 8X seems significantly larger for a mere 0.3 inch bump in display size. The iPhone 5 is already a bit large for my taste.</p>
<p>Looking at it from the front, I like the design: straight rectangular lines and sharp corners. Makes the Samsung Galaxy S III look like a toy and the iPhone 5 a bit outdated.</p>
