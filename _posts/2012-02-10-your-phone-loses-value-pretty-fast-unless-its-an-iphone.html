<blockquote><p>Not all cell phones are created equal. You can buy an iPhone 4S today and sell it a few months later on the secondary market for almost what you paid for it. However, if you buy the latest big fancy Android phone, a few months later it has lost hundreds of dollars in value.</blockquote></p>
<p>One reason why Android phones lose value so quickly is because the pace at which new Android phones are announced is so quick.</p>
