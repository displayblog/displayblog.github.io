<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/12/21appletv.html">Apple</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple today announced that it expects sales of its new Apple TV to top one million units later this week. The new Apple TV offers the simplest way to watch your favorite HD movies and TV shows, stream content from Netflix, YouTube, Flickr and MobileMe, all on your HD TV for the breakthrough price of just $99. iTunes users are now renting and purchasing over 400,000 TV episodes and over 150,000 movies per day.</blockquote></p>
<p>I'm thinking of getting an Apple TV: my fantasies of a minimalistic home is just not realistic with three kids, especially with a hundred or so DVDs littered everywhere. I know it will take a very long time but I plan to transform these DVDs into streamable files on iTunes. Then I'll hide the DVDs and take a small step toward realizing my minimalistic dream home.</p>
<p>And it's okay that Apple TV can only stream H.264 video at 720/30p: we only have DVDs and that's our old Toshiba's limit anyway.</p>
