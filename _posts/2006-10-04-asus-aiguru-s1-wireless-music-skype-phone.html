<p>Asustek Computer&acirc;&euro;&trade;s AiGuru S1 supports Skype and has WiFi built-in and features a wireless music player function and remote control. WiFi is the 802.11b/g type and uses the wireless connection to make Skype calls without the need of being tethered to a PC. The music is played through a built-in speaker and you can access and stream songs stored in the PC via WiFi. You can also use the AiGuru S1 as a remote control for Microsoft&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Media Player.</p>

<p>The display seems to be a monochrome type with a blue background, which is quite low-tech compared to <a href="http://displayblog.com/?p=311">Netgear&acirc;&euro;&trade;s SPH101</a>, which has a nice color display.</p>
