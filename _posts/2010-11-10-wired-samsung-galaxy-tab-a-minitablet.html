<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/reviews/2010/11/galaxy_tab/">Wired</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The most immediately noteworthy difference from the iPad is that the Galaxy is considerably smaller &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; physically about half the size and weight, with a 7-inch diagonal screen instead of the iPad&acirc;&euro;&trade;s 9.7 inches. However, the Tab&acirc;&euro;&trade;s 1024 x 600&acirc;&euro;&ldquo;pixel resolution makes this less of a big deal than you might expect. Considering the iPad&acirc;&euro;&trade;s 1024 x 768&acirc;&euro;&ldquo;pixel resolution, you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll find the Tab nearly as spacious, although the screen (a standard LCD) is not as bright and as clear as the iPad&acirc;&euro;&trade;s beauty.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Galaxy Tab's display seems quite good and Wired terms it a minitablet, a new class of mobile device, and not a director competitor to the iPad, a bona fide tablet.</p>
