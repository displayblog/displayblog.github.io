<p><a href="http://www.phonearena.com/news/HTC-M4-brings-One-style-sensibility-downmarket_id42524">PhoneArena</a>: Codenamed M4, which I'll call One mini, sports a 4.3-inch display with a 1280x720 pixel format. Although I prefer smaller smartphones&mdash;pre-iPhone 5 display sizes being the optimum size in my opinion&mdash;a mere addition of 0.4 inches on the HTC One gets me to to full 1920x1080. The difference in display size on the One mini is just too small to justify stepping down from 1920x1080.</p>
