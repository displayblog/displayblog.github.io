<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=toshiba">Toshiba</a>'s Qosmio G55 is one of the first notebook PCs to sport a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=18.4"">18.4"</a> TFT LCD. The 18.4" has a 16:9 aspect ratio and the pixel format is a wacky <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1680-x-945">1680 x 945</a>. So, compared to a 17" LCD with a 16:10 aspect ratio that has 1680 x 1050, you get less pixels, but for those who have less than perfect vision or who simply prefer larger fonts and icons right out of the box, this might be welcome news. This might be the sign of things to come as all LCD displays move from everything else to 16:9:</p>

Another interesting feature of the G55 is the Quad Core HD processor called SpursEngine that enhances video performance and enables hand gesture control. The SpursEngine is based on the cell processor that is used in the PlayStation 3. Hand gesture control sounds like too much trouble when all you need is a keyboard and a trackpad (or mouse), both of which come with the G55. Most people I know are fairly close to the notebook PC when they are using it, except for maybe when they are presenting, a case where hand gesturing might be better left to explaining what's on the chart rather than controlling the computer. But the folks at Laptop thinks that the G55 hand gesturing machine is  groundbreaking. I think hand gesturing is a difficult sell to most. Maybe it would be a great tool for those who use sign language.</p>
