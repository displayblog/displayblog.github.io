<p>Toshiba Mobile Display (TMD) <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/16/toshiba-enters-pixel-density-fray-with-367ppi-lcds-for-cellphone/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The mobile section of the booth will feature high-resolution LTPS displays, up to 367ppi (pixels per inch) resolution density, in sizes ranging from 3.3-inch to 4.0-inch with resolution formats ranging from Wide VGA (480 x 864) to HD (720 x 1280). In addition, these displays will demonstrate advanced technologies such as high-contrast (up to 1,500:1), high-color (up to 92% NTSC), and wide viewing angle (up to H/V 176 degrees/176 degrees). The displays are just a few representative examples of TMD's broad line of thin and light displays for mobile smartphones and other portable electronic devices.</blockquote></p>
<p>A 4-inch TFT LCD with a pixel format of 1280x720 sounds superb. The 367-ppi display is even higher than the 329-ppi 960x640 3.5-inch IPS LCD Retina Display used in the iPhone 4.</p>
