<p>According to <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/10/sneak-a-premature-peek-at-barnes-nobles-new-nook/?intcid=postnav">Wired</a>, Barnes & Noble has a media event on October 26th, tomorrow, at its Union Square stores, San Francisco. Nobody knows for sure what B&N will be announcing but it could be a Nook Color with a 7-inch color display for US$249. My guess is that the Nook Color will be a 7-inch LCD with a 1024x600 pixel format, much like Samsung's Galaxy Tab.</p>
