<p>On February 8, <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2010/2/comScore_Reports_December_2009_U.S._Mobile_Subscriber_Market_Share">comScore</a> released reported on smartphone trends in the US. In Q4'09, Apple and Google grew in market share while RIM, Microsoft and Palm didn't. Apple increased its market share from 24.1% to 25.3%, while Google more than doubled from 2.5% to 5.2%. The top smartphone platform in the US is still RIM holding 41.6% share in Q4'09, down from 42.6% a quarter earlier.</p>
<p><a href="http://jkontherun.com/2010/02/09/comscore-smartphone-numbers-google-grows-while-rim-slows/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+jkOnTheRun+%28jkOnTheRun%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">jkOnTheRun</a>'s Kevin C. Tofel took comScore's information and made a couple of easy-to-read charts. I like the first one, though it would have been more consistent to switch Palm and Microsoft. The second chart titled "Smartphone Subscriber Growth by Platform" shows Q/Q growth and Tofel points to Google's impressive "momentum of growth". Well, momentum it is not since it is just a snapshot. You would need a series of quarterly growth rates to get at momentum. Also recognize that growing from a small number is much easier to accomplish. For instance, it would be almost impossible for Apple to double its market share given its already large share even if a ridiculously amazing update to the iPhone is unveiled in June. I'm not trying to diminish the growth of Android but just to put these numbers in perspective.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">There was something missing. When you total all five smartphone platforms it isn't 100%. So I put an "Other" category and made a new chart. "Other" posted an impressive Q/Q growth of 8.6%. This shouldn't be too surprising since comScore also reported on the top mobile OEMs in the US. In Q4'09 the top five, in order, were: Motorola, LG, Samsung, Nokia, RIM. My guess would be Nokia (S60 and Maemo platforms) makes up a significant portion of "Other".</p></p>
