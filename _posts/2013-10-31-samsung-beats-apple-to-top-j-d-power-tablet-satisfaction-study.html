<p><a href="http://www.jdpower.com/consumer-ratings/telecom/ratings/919201690/2013-Tablet+Satisfaction+Study/index.htm">J.D. Power</a>: Weird. Samsung didn't score top marks in <em>any</em> category while Apple (iPad) scored top marks in all categories (Performance, East of Use, Physical Design, Tablet Features) except for Cost where it received 2 out of 5. And it is only the Cost category where Samsung (4 out of 5) beat Apple. There is only one explanation: J.D. Power considers Cost the most important category and is heavily weighted over the others.</p>
<p><em>Update 2013.11.01:</em> <em>via</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/11/01/panzarino-power-price">John Gruber</a>. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/01/jd-power-explains-why-samsung-beat-apple-in-its-latest-tablet-study-price/">Matthew Panzarino</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>So I reached out to JD Power and spoke to Kirk Parsons, senior director of telecommunications services. What he told us wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t too surprising, but it may help clear up some of the confusion. First off, the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;power circle&acirc;&euro;¬ù chart that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s being widely circulated is simply a visual tool, and not representative of the actual scores given to the brands evaluated in its survey.</p>
<p>The power circle chart showed Apple winning handily in four categories, including performance, ease of use, physical design and tablet features. Only one category showed a clear win for Samsung: cost. But most folks were a bit skeptical, considering that the JD Power report only weights cost as 16 percent of the overall score.</blockquote></p>
<p>So the Cost category is weighted at 16 percent. To me that doesn't seem large enough to offset Samsung's poorer performance in the other four categories.</p>
