<p>Industry sources are predicting that <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=philips">Philips</a> will be exiting the PDP TV market in 2009. Recent moves by the consumer electronics giant can be indicative of such a move. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=pdp">PDP</a> TVs are struggling against <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a>s and there are many PPD TV players that have recently established joint ventures for survival. Philips has reduced PDP TV shipments overall and has quite its operations in China's PDP TV market. </p>
<p>Despite the slowdown, Philips is still expected to ship 500,000 PDP TVs in 2008. Also, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=funai">Funai</a>, who now operates the Philips brand, has indicated that no development plans exist for PDP TVs from the end of 2008.</p>
