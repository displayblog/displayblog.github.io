<p>The high-resolution smartphone will be limited to Russia, hopefully just initially. I also hope that the OS is based on something open. Or maybe it is based on Google's <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=android">Android</a>. Who knows, but that would be nice. Let's allow the developers to bring their magic to super phones like the Edelweiss and see what they can do.</p>
<p>I hope one day soon in the future we can look forward to a 3.5" <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=multitouch">multitouch</a> LCD with <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1024-x-600">1024 x 600</a> pixels so we can surf like we surf at a desk but on a smartphone. A slide out QWERTY LCD with support for all languages (keys or simply a writing pad) with handwriting recognition and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=haptic">haptic</a> feedback (for typing) would also be a good feature to include.</p>
