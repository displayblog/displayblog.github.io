<p><a href="http://www.popgadget.net/2009/03/demy_the_digita.php">Popgadget</a>: Demy is the first and only kitchen-safe recipe reader. So that should mean that it is waterproof due to the occasional splash, drop-proof since someone will knock it over, high-temperature-proof since it will be near hot stuff, oil-proof since everyone stir-fries, scratch-proof and forks and knifes will probably hit the display. If not, then these guys are exaggerating that it is kitchen-safe. Key Ingredient is the company that thought of this (marvelous?) idea.</p>
<p>How do you sync recipes? You've got to connect the Demy with your PC. Terrible. It should have a WiFi connection. Can you scribble your own recipes on the screen? I'm pretty sure you can not. This is a MUST feature since not all ovens, stoves, microwaves, pots, pans and chefs are alike. A must I tell you!</p>
<p>At least you can make the text bigger so cooks with less-than-perfect eyesight can actually read text off of the Demy. The fact that you have to connect the Demy to your PC to sync recipes is a deal breaker. I would expect a WiFi connection and a scribble feature in the next version.</p>
