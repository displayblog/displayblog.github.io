<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/27/rim-introduces-playbook-the-blackberry-tablet/">Engadget</a>: The folks at RIM is touting the PlayBook's multimedia and gaming functions. I'm not sure if that's the right direction for RIM. The name is all wrong. BlackBerry and gaming or even multimedia don't fit very well. Think of the target audience. Who is it? Most BlackBerry toting folks are not into gaming. I would seriously doubt enterprise customers will be interested in a packaged deal including the PlayBook. I do understand the threat RIM is experiencing from Apple's continued growth with its iPad but I think RIM should have stuck with its core competency and its main customers with the direction of its tablet.</p>
<p>There is one 'business' feature that's unique: the PlayBook has the ability to display what's on your BlackBerry on the larger 7-inch LCD <em>via</em> Bluetooth. Availability is slated for early 2011. And so is the next-gen iPad. Early 2011 will be very interesting. Unfortunately, the PlayBook seems to be WiFi only at the moment but 3G and 4G models are coming in the future according to RIM.</p>
