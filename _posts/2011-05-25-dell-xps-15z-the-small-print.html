<p>Dell <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2011/may/25/dell-thinnest-laptop-or-not">Guardian</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Finally, the power you crave in the thinnest 15" PC on the planet*.</blockquote></p>
<p>The small print:</p>
<blockquote><p>* Based on Dell internal analysis as at February 2011. Based on a thickness comparison (front and rear measurements) of other 15" laptop PCs manufactured by HP, Acer, Toshiba, Asus, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony, MSI. No comparison made with Apple or other manufacturers not listed.</blockquote></p>
<p>The bottom line: Dell lied.</p>
