<p>A couple of my friends and I are investigating which battery cases to get for our iPhones. I have an iPhone 3G and they have the iPhone 3GS. The cases should work with either. So, I went googling around and here is what I found:</p>
<p><iframe width='728' height='300' frameborder='0' src='http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=t8659t9BwYwWLQxkdgmyB0A&single=true&gid=0&output=html&widget=true'></iframe></p>
<p>The conclusion seems to be, if you're wanting to maximize bang for your buck, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NNL8X0?ie=UTF8&tag=displ0f-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002NNL8X0">Accessory Power's EnerG Slim-Fit seems to be the way to go.</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=displ0f-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B002NNL8X0" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> It has a 2400mAh battery and costs just $39.99 at Amazon. Keep in mind the cover exposes your iPhone 3G/3GS and only protects the rear. If you want a battery case that is fully covered and with a lot of juice but don't mind bulk, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00243FHAY?ie=UTF8&tag=displ0f-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00243FHAY">KONNET's PowerKZ seems to be the right choice.</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=displ0f-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00243FHAY" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></p>
