<p><a href="http://www.avssymposium.org/paper.asp?abstractID=115.">AVS Symposium</a>: Universal Display Corporation (UDC) announced an OLED display made out of metal foil at less than 50 micrometers thin. That is very thin and thinner than a sheet of paper!</p>
<p>The metal foil substrate allows for flexibility and has "excellent thermal, mechanical and permeation barrier properties" according to UDC. The super-thin OLED exceeds the industrial target of 1000 hours. An impermeable barrier layer was used to package the OLEDs leading to longer lifetimes. Lifetimes are shortened by exposure to oxygen and water.</p>
<p>But just 1000 hours? That doesn't seem to be such a long time when current display technologies range from 50,000 to 60,000 hours. What is interesting is that the picture shown at Gizmodo (and here for reference) seems to be a LG.Philips LCD (now LG Display) flexible OLED display. Maybe it was LPL that developed prototypes based on UDC's OLED technology.</p>
