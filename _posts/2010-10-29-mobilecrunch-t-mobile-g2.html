<p>Devin Coldewey, <a href="http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2010/10/29/review-t-mobile-g2/">MobileCrunch</a>, on the T-Mobile G2:</p>
<blockquote><p>The 3.7&acirc;&euro;&sup3; &acirc;&euro;&oelig;super LCD&acirc;&euro;¬ù display is super indeed. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s extremely bright, perfectly visible in daylight, and showed colors extremely well. Its 800&Atilde;&mdash;480 resolution isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t quite the pixel density of the iPhone 4, but is still excellent. Contrast is excellent, and at minimum brightness it gives out very little light (great for clock/alarm apps like Bedside). No complaints at all about it.</blockquote></p>
<p>Seems like the T-Mobile G2 has an excellent display.</p>
