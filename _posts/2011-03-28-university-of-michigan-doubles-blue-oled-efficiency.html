<blockquote><p>Traditionally, the ceiling for the efficiency of fluorescent OLEDs was believed to be 5 percent. Now, Kieffer and his collaborators have produced fluorescent OLEDs with close to 10 percent efficiency.</blockquote></p>
<p>Professor John Kieffer and graduate student Changgua Zhen doubled the external quantum efficiency of blue OLEDs from 5% to 10%. This is good news as blue OLEDs have had the lowest efficiency among the three primary colors. Due to differences in efficiencies it has been a difficult balancing act of minimizing differential aging.</p>
<p>So what are the EQEs of green and red? I've googled high and low, but I haven't found anything definitive. It <em>seems</em> green fluorescent OLEDs have an EQE of around 7-10% with reds more in the 15% range. I think I'll need to ping my friends who are more knowledgeable. Stay tuned.</p>
