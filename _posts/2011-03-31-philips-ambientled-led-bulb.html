<p>Michael Graham Richard at <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2011/03/philips-ambientled-led-light-bulb-12-watts-review-shop-price.php">TreeHugger</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Philips AmbientLED 12.5-watt A19 LED lightbulb (quite a name!) is probably the favorite LED bulb that I've tried so far. It beats the competition when it comes to light output (800 lumens vs. 450-590 lumens for the other LEDs that I've tried), the design of the bulb is very innovative, and light quality is excellent.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Philips AmbientLED is rated for 25,000 hours, which translates to an average usable lifetime of about 15 years according to Philips. Not only that LEDs do not use mercury, like CFLs do. I've been wanting to try out an LED bulb but the cost has been prohibitive. But I don't think I'm calculating the cost correctly. For instance, how much does it cost when an incandescent or CFL bulb goes out and you have to go to the nearest hardware store to get some bulbs, every year for 15 years? Not having to worry about light bulbs for 15 years might be worth the US$39.95 asking price.</p>
