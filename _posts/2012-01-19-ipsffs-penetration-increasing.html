<blockquote><p>With the increasing use of tablet PCs and smart phones to view and share video, wide viewing angle performance is becoming a requirement in TFT LCDs. Two of the most common technologies for achieving wide viewing angle performance in TFT LCDs are IPS (in-plane switching) and FFS (fringe-field switching). [...] the penetration of IPS/FFS LCD panels in the mobile PC market (including notebook, tablet, and mini-note PCs) is increasing [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>On an area basis the share for IPS/FFS increased from 20% in 2010 to 23% of total LCD shipments in 2011.</p>
