<blockquote><p>Posting from my mobile so bare with me. Verizon stores in the midwest area (chicago) have the first generation ipads on sale. No need for contract. Prices start at $299.99 for the 16GB.</blockquote></p>
<p>This has been later confirmed. All corporate owned Verizon stores are offering the original WiFi-only iPads at steep discounts: the 16GB WiFi-only iPad 1 is $299. This is a fantastic deal and is better than the refurbished price from Apple by $50.</p>
