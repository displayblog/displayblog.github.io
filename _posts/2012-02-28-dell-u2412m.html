<p><a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/5550/dell-u2412m-16-10-ips-without-breaking-the-bank/1">AnandTech</a>: The US$329 Dell U2412M is a 24-inch 16:10 1920x1200 LCD monitor sporting a 6-bit + FRC e-IPS panel. If color is important to you, and it probably is if you're looking for an IPS monitor, I recommend spending a bit more for one with a bona fide 8-bit IPS panel with LUT.</p>
