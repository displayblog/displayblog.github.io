<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/06/apple-to-move-arm-soc-production-away-from-samsung-in-2012.ars">ars technica</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple's increasingly tenuous relationship with Samsung as a component supplier for its mobile devices could end next year, according to numerous sources inside the semiconductor industry. The company will likely tap contract fab Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company to build its next-generation ARM SoCs, currently dubbed "A6," sometime in 2012.</blockquote></p>
