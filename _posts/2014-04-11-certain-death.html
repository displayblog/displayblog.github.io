<p><a href="http://donmelton.com/2014/04/10/memories-of-steve/">Don Melton</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When demoing something to Steve, you had to pace yourself. If Steve said, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Stop,&acirc;&euro;¬ù you fucking stopped. Hands down and waited. And you didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t jiggle the cursor while he was looking at the screen. Certain death.</blockquote></p>
<p>What I find most irritating and most deserving of certain death are laser pointer jigglers.</p>
