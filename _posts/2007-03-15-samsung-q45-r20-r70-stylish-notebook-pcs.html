<p>Samsung's Q45 is a 12.1" wide notebook PC. The R20 sports a 14.1" wide. And the R70 has a 15.4" wide LCD. All three run Vista and is powered by Intel's Core 2 Duo CPUs. Interesting tid bits for each are as follows: The R20 has a silver-nano antibacterial coated keyboard. This might sound quite weird, but unless you remember to wash your hands every time before you start typing away, the keyboard becomes a pretty dirty place in no time. I wonder how long the antibacterial effect will last? The R70 has an HDMI port. The Q45 has WiBRO (Korea's version of mobile WiMax) and HSDPA.</p>

<p>The design is impressive: gives me the black MacBook feel. The black high glossy coating makes it look nice with simple and straight lines. There is a 6-in-1 memory card reader and the AVS Multimedia feature allows the user to view movies, photos and music without booting up Windows.</p>
