<p><a href="http://youtu.be/akS3iFt9VvA">YouTube</a>: According to <a href="http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/123689-burberry-s-christopher-bailey-talks-iphone-5s-being-mates-with-jony-and-the-new-spring-summer-2014-collection">Pocket-lint</a> Burberry used the new iPhone 5s, 14 of them, to shoot its spring and summer 2014 collection during London Fashion Week. Chief Creative Officer at Burberry, Christopher Bailey:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple has made technology very effortless and very natural. We often talk about the trench coat as effortless elegance. You can throw it over an evening dress or pair of jeans. I think that the iPhone has the same type of philosophy as this. It is beautifully designed, but you take it everywhere, you carry it everywhere. But it also creates the most beautiful imagery and you can use that on a variety of different platforms like we have today.</blockquote></p>
<p>That's the first time I've heard the iPhone compared to a trench coat, but it's interestingly apt. Bailey's favorite feature on the iPhone 5s? Slow-mo.</p>
