<p>Most of the displays that were showcased during InfoComm 2008 were geared toward the professional AV markets and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lg">LG</a>'s 60PG30C is no different. But the 60PG30C has a very consumer-oriented look and feature set. Let's have a look.</p>
<p>Although the picture didn't come out very well (looks like the content is <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=3d">3D</a>, but is not) the 60PG30C has a very nice piano-black casing and is quite thin. The very bright 1500 cd/m2 plasma should bode well in brightly lit areas like a meeting room or recreation room in your office building. The 30,000 contrast ratio provided images that looked great on the showroom floor and the 100,000 hour panel life should allow the 60PG30C to last longer than most startup companies.</p>
