<p>I was under the impression the dual touch display Libretto W100 from Toshiba was going to be available at the end of August and in Japan. At least that's what the press release mentioned (read <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/21/toshiba-libretto-w100-dual-7-inch-display-umpc/"><em>Toshiba Libretto W100: Dual 7-inch Display UMPC</em></a> for more info). Well, according to <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20100622PD212.html">DIGITIMES</a>, the Libretto W100 will sport an Intel Pentium U5400 CPU and a 62GB SSD. There will be no more than 10 units available at launch, which is at the end of <em>this</em> month. The price? NT$45,000 or about US$1,400. If I were to make a decision right now as to when the Libretto W100 will be available I would put my bet on the official Toshiba press release, but who knows? Guess we will find out in about a week.</p>
