<p>Ashlee Vance and Peter Burrows at <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_15/b4223041200216.htm">Bloomberg Businessweek</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Playtime is over in Android Land. Over the last couple of months Google has reached out to the major carriers and device makers backing its mobile operating system with a message: There will be no more willy-nilly tweaks to the software. No more partnerships formed outside of Google's purview. From now on, companies hoping to receive early access to Google's most up-to-date software will need approval of their plans. And they will seek that approval from Andy Rubin, the head of Google's Android group.</blockquote></p>
<p>John Gruber at <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/03/31/android-open">Daring Fireball</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>So here&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the Android bait-and-switch laid bare. Android was &acirc;&euro;&oelig;open&acirc;&euro;¬ù only until it became popular and handset makers dependent upon it. Now that Google has the handset makers by the balls, Android is no longer open and Google starts asserting control.</blockquote></p>
<p>Conclusion: Google is no longer open.</p>
