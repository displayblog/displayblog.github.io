<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?=samsung">Samsung</a> introduced the SyncMaster CX2232GW/BW, which is a 22" wide <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?=lcd-monitor">LCD monitor</a> with a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?=1680-x-1050">1680 x 1050</a> pixel format. A smaller 20" SyncMaster CX2032GW/BW was also introduced with the same pixel format. It is obvious pretty much right away that folks who like larger fonts will opt for the 22" version while the budget-conscious with fairly young eyes will go for the 20". Both use what Samsung terms Magic Clear panel and both have a nickname: Swan. The two LCD monitors will be available in South Korea very soon. Other Swan models have been available in Korea since January 2007.</p>

<p>Prices are as follows:<br />
20" SyncMaster CX2032GW/BW: &acirc;&sbquo;&copy;368,000 ($399)<br />
22" SyncMaster CX2232GW/BW: &acirc;&sbquo;&copy;437,000 ($475).</p>

I guess the Swan LCD monitors are pretty popular in Korea, selling more than a million units in 6 months.&Acirc;&nbsp; Samsung expects to sell more than 3 million in 2007. One feature that makes these Swan monitors popular is the use of "an elastomer material" for the hinges that lets you adjust the angles in any which way. I'm not sure exactly what that means, but I'm guessing it's sort like the iMac G4: tilt and angle to your heart's content.</p>
<p>The Magic Clear panels give you an improved contrast ratio of 700:1, faster response times of 8ms, anti-reflective coating for better color, eliminates glare and distortions, and then some. The price seems to be a bit on the high side, but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for. Let's hope so.</p>
