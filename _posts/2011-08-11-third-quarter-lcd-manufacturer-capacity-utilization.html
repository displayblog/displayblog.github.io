<blockquote><p>Suppliers in Taiwan, South Korea and China, however, reacted differently. Taiwan makers, due to their lack of own-brand system products, will have to lower utilization rates to about 70-75% in third-quarter 2011. Korea makers, with support from their own branded products, will maintain utilization rates of 80-85%, with the possibility of going further up, according to WitsView.</blockquote></p>
<p>China's BOE Technology Gen 6 will run at full utilization in the third quarter.</p>
