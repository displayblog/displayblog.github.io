<p>If you are a Gmail user and added your email account on the iPhone, go to Settings &rarr; Mail, Contacts, Calendars &rarr; Gmail (or whatever you named your Gmail account) &rarr; and make sure to turn on Calendars. The iPhone will ask some questions and when you're done you are now automatically syncing with Google Calendar when you update your Apple Calendar on your iPhone.</p>
