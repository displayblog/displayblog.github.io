<blockquote><p>Overall I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m liking Camera+ plus quite a bit. It has almost all of the features that I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d want. I really dig the touch-control for aperture in addition to focus. The only big thing missing is the HDR capability in the built-in camera app, but Camera+ has a lot more going for it that it might become my goto camera app on my iPhone.</blockquote></p>
