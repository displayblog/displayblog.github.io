<p>Tim Culpan, Adam Satariano, and Ian King, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-26/apple-said-to-prepare-new-12-9-inch-ipad-for-early-2015.html">Bloomberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The new iPad will have a screen measuring 12.9 inches diagonally, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the details aren&acirc;&euro;&trade;t public. Apple currently produces iPads with 9.7-inch and 7.9-inch displays. The Cupertino, California-based company has been working with suppliers for at least a year to develop a new range of larger touch-screen devices, said the people.</blockquote></p>
