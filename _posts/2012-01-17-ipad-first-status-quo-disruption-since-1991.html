<blockquote><p>This view is more alarming. Given the first chart, in order for the iPad to be significant, it would need to be &acirc;&euro;&oelig;visible&acirc;&euro;¬ù for a market that already ships over 350 million units. And there it is. If counted, the iPad begins to show the first disruption in the status quo since 1991.</blockquote></p>
<p>This view refers to the chart titled "Traditional + iPad".</p>
