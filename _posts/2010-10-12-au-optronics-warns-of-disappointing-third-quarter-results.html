<p>AU Optronics (AUO) is warning that its third quarter results will be disappointing and significantly lower compared to the second quarter. Third quarter results will be announced on October 27th. The main reason for this downturn is collapsing LCD panel prices. Source: <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20101011PD214.html">Digitimes</a></p>
