<p>[ <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/1/5/10714528/samsung-notebook-9-windows-10-laptop-announced-ces-2016">The Verge</a> ] The Samsung Notebook 9 laptops come in two sizes: 13.3 inches and 15 inches. The 13.3-inch version is light at just 1.85 lbs or 0.84 kg. As a comparison the 12-inch MacBook weighs 2.03 lbs or 0.92 kg. The bigger Notebook 9 is lighter. Now that's something.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;13.3-inch Notebook 9&nbsp;is thin at just 13.4 mm, but the MacBook&nbsp;is a tiny bit thinner at 13.1 mm.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll continue to compare these two laptops because they both push the limit of thinness and lightness. I don't know what the Notebook 9 is made of, but it looks metallic from the photos&nbsp;on The Verge. Of course that can be deceiving: metallic paint over plastic can look a lot like aluminum or some sort of alloy.</p>
<p>Vlad Savov mentioned at 83% battery the Notebook 9 was reporting 3 hours and 33 minutes left.&nbsp;That must have been some wonky estimate by the operating system; according to <a href="http://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-introduces-new-notebook-9-series-for-2016">Samsung</a>&nbsp;battery life is rated at up to 10 hours, that compares well to the 12-inch MacBook, which&nbsp;is one hour less, wirelessly web surfing.</p>
<p>Unlike the Core M CPU in the MacBook, the Notebook 9 series can be equipped with a Skylake Core i7. But a fan comes along with that power. The MacBook is relatively weaker, but fanless. Power and noise or less power and silence. Would be nice if we didn't have to choose.</p>
<p>The display is where the Notebook 9 series falls short. Both sizes are limited to 1920x1080. That is not bad, but it's not great when compared to a smaller 12-inch MacBook&nbsp;that sports a pixel format of&nbsp;2304x1440.</p>
<p>The Notebook 9 looks luxurious, but it's the little things that count. In The Verge video&nbsp;you see&nbsp;Vlad Savov&nbsp;needing both hands to open the lid.&nbsp;And that bottom bezel is asymmetrically large.</p>
<p>Pricing and available dates have not been announced.</p>
