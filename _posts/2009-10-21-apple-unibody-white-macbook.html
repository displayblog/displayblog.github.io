  Washy:</strong> That's what seems to be happening with the FireWire port on
  the white <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=macbook&amp;sa=Search#1363\">MacBook</a>.
  The latest unibody white MacBook has lost the FireWire port. Again. And again it
  will annoy a lot of potential customers of the most affordable MacBook, starting
  at just US$999. The FireWire port allows for the MacBook to act simply as an external
  FireWire drive and makes troubleshooting significantly easier. Do you have a camcorder
  with FireWire and want to record directly into the MacBook? You're out of luck.
  The audio-out port has been eliminated too in favor of an integrated port with audio-out
  and mic-in. Not such a terrible idea since you can use the <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=iphone&amp;sa=Search#1348\">iPhone</a>
  earphone/mic for communicating via Skype. Of course, if you're a musician and
  require both audio-out and mic-in, you might have to get one of those USB microphones.
  Oh, and no SD slot.\r\n\r\n<strong>Unibody</strong> The unibody design certainly
  reduces complexity and helps to increase rigidity. It also means that the battery
  is integrated and no longer easily replaceable. But you do get more battery life:
  Apple rates it at 7 hours. Engadget took delivery of the new MacBook and found the
  unibody design led to a much more solid feel: \"there's zero flex when you pick
  it up by a corner, and the keyboard is nicely rigid.\" The white bezel is still
  there--no edge-to-edge cover glass for the white MacBook. The <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=led+backlight&amp;sa=Search#1363\">LED

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-7500 aligncenter" title="iFixit_2009_Apple_Unibody_White_MacBook_Teardown" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/iFixit_2009_Apple_Unibody_White_MacBook_Teardown.jpg" alt="iFixit_2009_Apple_Unibody_White_MacBook_Teardown" width="728" height="492" /></p></p>
<p><strong>Teardown</strong> <a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook-Polycarbonate-Unibody/1239/1">Kyle Wiens and folks at iFixit already tore the MacBook apart</a> and revealed some interesting tidbits. First, the lower case is actually made of aluminum. The battery is held by three tri-wing screws. The hard disk is much harder to get at than the previous version so you'll need to put aside some time if you want to upgrade it with a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=ssd&amp;sa=Search#1348">SSD</a>. iFixit's conclusion is that the new MacBook's internals are quite simple, elegant even. Inside the LCD casing, there are three wireless antennas on the left and a single display data cable on the right. A single cable transmits all data and power. The display assembly is now 50 grams lighter than the previous version.</p>
