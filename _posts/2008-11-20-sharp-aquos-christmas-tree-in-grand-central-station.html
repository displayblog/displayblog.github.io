  href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sharp\">Sharp</a> showcased
  a Christmas tree in Grand Central Station (New York, NY). That's nothing special
  but this Christmas tree was covered with 43 <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=aquos\">AQUOS</a>
  <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv\">LCD TV</a>s.
  Starting from very large 52\" units and progressively getting smaller as you go
  up with 19\" units at the top. All of the 43 AQUOS LCD TVs are connected and show
  a coordinated video show: waterfall, snowfall, etc. The patterns on the video were
  created by Tsuyoshi Takashiro, a Japanese video artist. Ten new patterns will adorn
  the LCD Christmas tree next month. Why did Sharp do this? "

<p>Sharp wants everyone to know about <a href="http://www.thehopeprogram.org/">The Hope Program</a>. The Hope Program is a non-profit organization that provides job training and career counseling to those who are less fortunate and help them to get out of poverty. People can sign up at LCD kiosks nearby for a chance to win one of the AQUOS LCD TVs on the Christmas tree. One registration equals one dollar to The Hope Program's <a href="http://www.thehopeprogram.org/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=169">Green Collar Project</a>, which trains people to work in environmental jobs such as solar panel installation. Sharp will donate a minimum of US$50,000 and up to $100,000. That's the Christmas spirit!</p>
