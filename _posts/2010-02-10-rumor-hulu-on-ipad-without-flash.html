<p><a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/02/10/hulu_to_make_videos_available_on_ipad_without_flash_rumor.html">AppleInsider</a>: A Flash-less Hulu is in the works according to TechCrunch. And it should work quite well with the iPad. I presume it would work quite well on the iPhone too. The Flash-less Hulu is expected to be available when the iPad launches in March 2010. A Flash-less Hulu would determine an inflection point from which Flash will slowly fade into the dark.</p>
