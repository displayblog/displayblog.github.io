<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-12/how-steve-jobs-got-the-iphone-into-japan.html">Bloomberg</a>: SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son shared how he got the iPhone into Japan with <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/video/softbank-ceo-masayoshi-son-charlie-rose-03-11-42hVejRiTYagXWH~9MohJQ.html">Charlie Rose</a>. He met Steve Jobs two years before Apple announced the iPhone and asked.</p>
<blockquote><p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;I said, &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Well, I don't need to give you my dirty paper, but once you have your own product, give me for Japan.&acirc;&euro;&trade; And he said, &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Masa, you are crazy.&acirc;&euro;&trade;&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>According to Son, Jobs said, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;We have not talked to anybody, but you came to see me as the first guy. I'll give it to you.&acirc;&euro; The negotiation continued, as Son asked that Jobs put in writing that Apple would give him exclusivity for the Japanese market. Jobs's reply? &acirc;&euro;&oelig;&acirc;&euro;&tilde;No! Masa, I'm not going to sign for you because you don't even own a mobile carrier yet!&acirc;&euro;&trade; And I said, &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Well, look, Steve, you promised me. You gave me your word. I bring a carrier for Japan.&acirc;&euro;&trade;&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>And he did. SoftBank spent more than $15 billion to buy Vodafone Group's Japanese unit in 2006. Sure enough, SoftBank Mobile, then a <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2008-06-05/apples-japan-iphone-strategybusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice">distant third</a> in the market, announced a deal with Apple in 2008 to carry the iPhone.</blockquote></p>
<p>Sometimes you need to be crazy, and ask.</p>
