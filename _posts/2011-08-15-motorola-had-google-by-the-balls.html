<blockquote>
<p>I think Motorola knew they had Google by the balls. Google needed Motorola&acirc;&euro;&trade;s patent library to defend Android as a whole, Motorola knew it, and they made Google pay and pay handsomely. I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t think it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s curious at all why Google didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t simply license Motorola&acirc;&euro;&trade;s patents. Motorola held out for a full acquisition at a premium far above the company&acirc;&euro;&trade;s actual value, and threatened to go after its sibling Android partners if Google didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t acquiesce. Thus the public threats from Jha and Icahn. Thus the high price. Thus the lack of a simpler, cheaper licensing agreement. Thus the unusual $2.5 billion reverse breakup fee.</p><br />

<p>Makes perfect sense.</p></p>
