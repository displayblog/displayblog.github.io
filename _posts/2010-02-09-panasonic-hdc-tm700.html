<p><a href="http://en.akihabaranews.com/33746/camcorder/panasonic-unleash-in-japan-the-world-first-108060p-compact-camcorder-the-hdc-tm700">Akihabara News</a>: The HDC-TM700 from Panasonic is the world's first camcorder that records 1080/60p. To store 1080/60p at 28Mbps the HDC-TM700 has 96GB of internal memory. If that's not enough you can add up to 64GB more via a SDXC card.</p>
