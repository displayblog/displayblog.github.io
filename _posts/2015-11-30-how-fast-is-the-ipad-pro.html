<p>[ <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/3006268/tablets/tested-why-the-ipad-pro-really-isnt-as-fast-a-laptop.html">PC World</a> ] Gordon Mah Ung:</p>
<blockquote><p>The truth is, most of the testing I&rsquo;ve run shows the iPad Pro <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> faster than a current or even two-year old Core-class Intel CPU. (Atom, now that&rsquo;s another story.)</blockquote><br />
We human beings interact with things like computers, tablets, and smartphones on a hardware plus software level. No matter how fast the hardware is if the software is not developed to take advantage of it and in a way that we can use and delight in, then what's the point?</p>
<p>I recently started capturing videos of&nbsp;our church's&nbsp;sermons. I've been using my iPhone 4s with an <a href="https://www.olloclip.com/shop/lenses/iphone4-telephoto/">olloclip telephoto lens</a> that gives me a 2x optical zoom. In 720p mode a 50-minute video takes up about 4-5 GBs. Capturing the video is no problem, even for an old iPhone 4s. (Capturing&nbsp;50-minute long&nbsp;720p videos on a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 on the&nbsp;other hand is a pain -- I couldn't do it because of file size limitations. I'm sure there is a solution out there, but I think regular users who just want to record long videos will give up.)&nbsp;What takes a lot of computing time is adding title pages,&nbsp;transitions, and&nbsp;then exporting&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>On a 2.8GHz Core 2 Duo MacBook Pro (mid-2009) with 4GB RAM and a 5400RPM 1TB hard drive&nbsp;using the GeForce 9400M GPU the exporting part takes about 3 hours. This is using Final Cut Pro X.</p>
<p>I also have an old Lenovo Thinkcentre S20 with a 2.93GHz Xeon W3540 CPU, 4GB RAM, a 1TB 7200RPM hard drive, and a NVIDIA Quadro FX4800 GPU. Rendering using this setup take a little less time than on the MacBook Pro, but for some reason Premiere Pro has a problem with video captured by iPhones: toward the later half the video and audio starts to diverge. This is a known problem with solutions that don't work. I've tried using Handbrake and re-encoded the videos using non-variable bit rates, without success. The only solution has been to use Final Cut Pro X on the MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>On a whim, I decided to try editing on iMovie on my iPhone 6s. I don't require a lot of editing -- just adding a couple of title pages, some transitions, and a bit of zooming in -- and iMovie, after watching a few YouTube tutorials, was sufficient for my needs. What was surprising was how quickly iMovie exported. I'd say it took about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>I am definitely <em>not</em> saying the iPhone 6s is exponentially faster than a&nbsp;Core 2 Duo&nbsp;MacBook Pro or a Xeon workstation when it comes to video encoding. But what I will say is the iMovie and iPhone software hardware combination beats out the Final Cut Pro and MacBook Pro combination by a mile when it comes to encoding video, if all you need to do is add a few title pages, transitions, zoom in, and export to a file you can upload to YouTube.</p>
<p>If the iMovie+iPhone 6s combo can do that, I'm thinking the iPad Pro with a GPU that's quite a bit more powerful than what's in the iPhone 6s will shrink the time down even more, to about half?!</p>
<p>PS: This past Sunday I retired the iPhone 4s and will be using an iPhone 6s to record going forward.</p>
