<p>AU Optronics (AUO) has started to ship 32" LCD TV panels to Sony this month. There are two models that AUO ships to Sony. One is a lesser model that has 16 CCFLs and is shipped also to Samsung. The other is a higher-quality model that uses 12 CCFLs and prism films. AUO's monthly shipments to Sony is expected to be 100,000 - 150,000 panels in September and October.</p>
<p>I thought more CCFLs meant more brightness. But maybe the addition of prism films improve front screen performance despite a 4-CCFL deficiency. The 12 CCFL plus prism films model might be touted as an energy efficient model that could be more in demand in regions that value energy efficiency.</p>
<p>Prism films, also known as brightness enhancing films (BEF), increase the brightness, but on the negative, it reduces viewing angles--a tradeoff. Now would would really be a "higher-quality" 32" LCD TV panel is if there were 16 CCFLs with BEF.</p>
