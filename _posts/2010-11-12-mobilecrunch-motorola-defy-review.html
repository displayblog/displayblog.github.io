<blockquote><p>I love the screen. 854&Atilde;&mdash;480 at 3.7&acirc;&euro;&sup3; is extremely sharp, and it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s bright enough to work in bright lighting. The touchscreen was responsive and accurate even when wet (though not underwater), though things didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t seem nearly as smooth as the G2 despite having similar specs. I blame MOTOBLUR.</blockquote></p>
<p>Motorola thought they were adding something nice with MOTOBLUR but ended up taking away a potentially solid experience. Is there a way to get a stock Android 2.2 on the Defy? I think the waterproof and dustproof Motorola Defy would be a great choice for someone who wants to get on the smartphone bandwagon but isn't careful enough with fragile high-tech gadgets. BTW, did you know the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/11/09/squaretrade-iphone-4-most-reliable-least-rugged/">iPhone 4 is the least rugged</a>? Corning's Gorilla Glass covering will certainly help with preventing scratches on the beautiful display.</p>
