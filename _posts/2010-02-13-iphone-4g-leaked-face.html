<p>iResQ claims it has obtained the LCD of the next generation iPhone, iPhone 4G. Verizon and AT&amp;T are planning to launch 4G cellular services this year so the name iPhone 4G isn't too far fetched.</p>
<p>The LCD and the touch layer is glued together on the supposedly iPhone 4G's LCD, similar to the first generation iPhone. This would certainly mean higher repair prices if you happen to break the front glass, but it also means you will almost never see dust in between the front face and the LCD behind it.</p>
<p>There's another very interesting feature of the iPhone 4G: It is taller. And from what I can tell, narrower. The display itself doesn't look any different in size but it does look darker.
