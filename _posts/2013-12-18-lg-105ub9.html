<p><a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/newsroom/contents/64059">LG</a>: The LG 105UB9 is a 21:9 105-inch curved TV with a pixel format of 5120x2160. The 105UB9 sports a total of more than 11 million pixels. LG calls this display CinemaScope, which is fitting as I can imagine how cinema-like it'll be in my living room. LG will be showcasing the 105UB9 at CES 2014. Note this isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t a curved OLED; it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a curved <em>LCD</em>.</p>
