<p><a href="http://www.toptenusa.org/">TopTen USA</a> is:</p>
<blockquote><p>a nonprofit organization that identifies and publicizes the most energy-efficient products on the market.</blockquote></p>
<p>I wanted to know what the most energy-efficient notebook PC was. That honor goes to the Sony's 8-inch ultra-wide non-netbook that's pseudo-pocketable. Apple's white MacBook was ranked #2 and at #3 was the Acer Aspire One 533 Series. Nothing out of the ordinary, but what I found surprising was there were five ASUS models in this <a href="http://www.toptenusa.org/Computers/Laptop-Computers">list of 10</a>.</p>
