<p><a href="http://64.233.179.104/translate_c?hl=en&u=http://www.watch.impress.co.jp/av/docs/20080730/sanyo.htm&usg=ALkJrhjVsY_dmcO8yuFsrfXvnnDzrGuXFg">Impress</a> &rarr; <a href="http://www.akihabaranews.com/en/news-16477-Sanyo+announce+its+New+Xacti+Compact+HD+Camera%2C+the+HD800%2C+Hands-On.html">Akihabara News</a> &rarr; <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/07/30/sanyos-xacti-dmx-hd800-the-best-gets-better/">Engadget</a>: Sanyo announced its XACTI DMX-HD800 digital camcorder, an improved model from the vastly popular DMX-HD700 that was introduced in September 2007. In about 10 months, Sanyo was able to improve the 720p digital camcorder quite a bit. The improvement comes mostly in video quality, according to Akihabara News, thanks to Sanyo's 3DDNR three dimensional noise filter. The HDMX-HD800 records 1280x720 videos in AVC (H.264) format.</p>
<p>The DMX-HD800 can also take 8MP still images, which is quite a bit. Normally, a device like the HD800 that tries to do both video and still images can result in one suffering in quality. It seems the HD800 has the video part down solid. I hope the still images are of high quality as well. If so, that would mean a single device for recording video and taking pictures. That would be nice.</p>
<p>For the majority of consumers the HD800's 720p format should be plenty, especially if you have a LCD TV that has a pixel format of 1366x768. However, the trend seems to be toward 1080p for LCD TVs and video content (e.g. Blu-ray). If you want to use every pixel of your newly bought 1080p LCD TV, you'll need to save up quite a bit more for a 1080p capable digital camcorder that can record in 1920 x 1080. But if you're not in the 1080p crowd and want the best 720p camcorder, Sanyo's DMX-HD800 will definitely require a thorough look.</p>
