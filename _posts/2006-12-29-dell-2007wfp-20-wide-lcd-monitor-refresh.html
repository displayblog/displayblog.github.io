<p>Engadget has a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/12/29/dell-updates-2007wfp-lcd-forgets-to-tell-anyone/">blog post</a> about Dell's 2007WFP. Some have noted that its actually a 2707WFP, a 27" LCD monitor. Well, the redesign sure is different from the current 20" wide models. I am not aware that a 27" is in the works, but if it is, then most likely it'll have a 1920 x 1200 pixel format, a bit higher than the 1680 x 1050 that we see in the 20" wide models. With all of the inputs that we see, I would hazard to guess that it will most likely be a 27" rather than a 20". Just a guess.</p>

<p><em>Update 2007.01.02</em><br />
According to a blog post on <a href="http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=5518">DailyTech</a>, a Dell representative had a conversatioin with DailyTech explaining the image came from an upcoming W2707C display training manual. The "C" in W2707C is a suffix denoting a display marketed toward the consumer, instead of business. Other consumer-oriented models already exist such as Dell's 26" LCD TV with a model name of W2607C or the W3707C, a 37" LCD TV. What is confusing is the blog states the resolution to be 1920 x 1200, which is a typical LCD monitor resolution and not a TV resolution. A TV resolution at that level would be 1920 x 1080. But even that resolution would be weird too since Dell's top-of-the-line LCD TV, the W3707C, only has a pixel format of 1366 x 768. So, what I think is happening is something a bit more, if in fact the W2707C sports a pixel format of 1920 x 1200: Dell is coming out with a multi-function monitor that acts as a monitor but can double-duty as a TV. The extra 60 horizontal lines on top and on the bottom can be easily taken care of by a scaler when watching 16:9 video. Who says monitors must have 1920 x 1200 and TVs must have 1920 x 1080?</p>
