<p><a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/05/09/previous_gen_apple_ipad_iphone_3gs_often_outsell_new_android_devices.html">AppleInsider</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Checks with U.S. retail sales channels conducted by Canaccord Genuity technology analyst Michael Walkley found that the iPhone 4 is "by far" the top selling device at both carriers AT&T and Verizon. But Apple's older devices have also found great success.</p>
<p>"Interestingly, our April checks indicated continued strong demand for the iPhone 3GS at AT&T and iPad 1 at Verizon, as these older generation products with reduced prices often outsold new Android products," Walkley wrote in a note to investors on Monday. "We believe this highlights Apple's significant competitive advantage, and these older products help Apple offer a tiered pricing strategy at key channels."</blockquote></p>
<p>It's tough to beat a $49 iPhone.</p>
