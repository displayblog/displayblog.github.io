<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20101019PB201.html">DigiTimes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>High Tech Computer (HTC) is expected to delay the launch of its tablet PC from the original schedule of the fourth quarter of 2010 to the second quarter of 2011 as Google has turned its support priority for Android 3.0 (Gingerbread) to Motorola, and LG will receive the priority for Android 3.5 (Honeycomb)...</blockquote></p>
<p>Support priority? The Chinese-language Apple Daily cited a JPMorgan analyst, so take this with a grain of salt. If true, open does not mean equal access it seems.</p>
