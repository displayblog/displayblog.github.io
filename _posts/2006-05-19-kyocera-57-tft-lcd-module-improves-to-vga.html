<p>Kyocera is manufactures small-medium sized LCD modules. The company updated its 5.7" TFT LCD that originally had a limited pixel format of QVGA (320*240) to a more usable VGA (640*480) pixel format. The display has a luminance of 350 cd/m2 and has a very long lifecycle of 75,000 hours. Usual operating temperatures are around 10C to 60C, but Kyocera built it to withstand a bit more cold and a bit more hot: -10C to 70C.</p>
