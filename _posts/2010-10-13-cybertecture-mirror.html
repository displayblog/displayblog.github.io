<p>A mirror that acts as a display. That's what the Cybertecture Mirror is. Too bad it isn't touch-enabled. I would expect an iOS app would be a nice replacement remote. Hop on over to <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/13/cybertecture-mirror-reflects-our-fantasies-looks-set-to-become/">Engadget</a> for videos that do a lot better at explaining what it can do.</p>
