<p><a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2104064/where-apple-design-is-headed-in-2014.html">Dave Wiskus, Macworld</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As it stands now, iOS 7 is a series of solvable problems. The things you could label as deficiencies are mostly a result of that swinging pendulum&mdash;an overcorrection of skeuomorphism. So what comes next is most likely balance and refinement. Buttons might not need to look like they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re being physically pressed if you tap them, but <em>some</em> feedback is useful.</blockquote></p>
<p>Overcorrection of skeuomorphism is an accurate assessment in many ways.</p>
<p>The default system font in iOS 7 is Helvetica Neue; to me it's too skinny. But when I flip on Bold Text under Accessibility it becomes too fat. I'd like something in between.</p>
<p>I don't have many apps on my iPhone, but among the 24 on the first, and only, screen my favorite is Instagram. Shaded corners subtly bring about a third dimension. The reflections of the glass in the lens is a nice touch. The overall feel of the icon doesn't give off a sense of desperation, to be realistic or to be simplistic. I like the balanced approach.</p>
