<p>Matsushita increased its plasma TV capacity 2.3x from 1.5 million to 3.42 million units per year. The factory is located in Amagasaki, Hyogo Prefecture and has also more than double the number of factory workers to 850, compared to 400 in September 2005. Matsushita's total plasma TV production capacity is 5.52 million per year including the plants located in Ibaraki, Osaka Prefecture and its Shanghai plant. Matsushita will invest 180 billion yen to build the world's largest plasma TV factory next to its Amagasaki plant and the factory will start mass production in July 2007.</p>
