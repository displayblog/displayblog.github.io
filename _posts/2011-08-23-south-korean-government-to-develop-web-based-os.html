<p>South Korea, Ministry of Knowledge Economy, Deputy Minister <a href="http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2011/08/23/2011082300723.html">Jae-hong Kim</a> :</p>
<blockquote><p>We plan to develop Korea's own web-based operating systems by forming a consortium of local companies.</p>
<p>We will forge ahead in developing a new kind of operating system, which is being seen as a next-generation product, in order to build the kind of advantage we do not enjoy in the market for smartphones and tablet PCs, which is dominated by Google and Apple.</blockquote></p>
<p>I highly recommend the South Korean government <em>not</em> to get involved in developing an operating system. Instead it should step aside and simply suggest to either Samsung or LG to purchase webOS from HP.</p>
