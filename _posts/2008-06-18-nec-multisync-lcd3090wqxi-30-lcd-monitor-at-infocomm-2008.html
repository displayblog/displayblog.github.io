<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=nec">NEC</a>'s LCD3090WQXi is a beautiful LCD monitor. You really have to see the actual picture quality on the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=30"">30"</a> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-monitor">LCD monitor</a> to truly appreciate the near perfect image quality. I am currently at InfoComm 2008 being held in Las Vegas and there are many interesting displays being showcased. When I was at the NEC booth, I could not help noticing the brilliant colors on the frog that was being displayed on the LCD3090WQXi. I knew I had to start saving up now if I wanted to afford this beauty.</p>
<p>The pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=2560-x-1600">2560 x 1600</a> is normal for a 30" LCD monitor, but what is not normal is the 102% US NTSC color gamut that bring out some incredible colors thanks to the wide color gamut CCFL (WCG-CCFL). The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=ips">IPS</a> LCD panel technology feature a 1000:1 contrast ratio, 6ms GTG, 350 cd/m2 of brightness and a very good 178/178 viewing angle.</p>
