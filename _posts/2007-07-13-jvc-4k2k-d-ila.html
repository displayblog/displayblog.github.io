<p>Victor Company of Japan, better known as JVC, announced new D-ILA (or Direct-Drive Image Light Amplifier) imagers that have 4096 x 2400 pixels with a diagonal size of just 1.27". The company claims the new imager is the world's smallest (as of June 20, 2007) and is a reduction of JVC's previous D-ILA imager by 43%. The device generates a contrast ratio of 20,000:1.</p>
<p>JVC's D-ILA is a vast improvement over the base technology, which is Liquid Crystal on Silicon, or LCoS. Sony is JVC's biggest competitor with its own improved version of LCoS called SXRD.</p>
<p>A bit of history: In the fall of 2000, JVC developed the first 7.86 megapixel imager (3840 x 2048 pixels) D-ILA device. Then the company developed a 1.7" 4K2K D-ILA imager with 5,000:1 contrast ratio and incorporated it into its 600" projector that was installed in the NHK Super High-Vision Theater at EXPO 2005 Aichi in September 2004.</p>
<p>The new 1.27" D-ILA imager borrows technology from JVC's DLA-HD1 D-ILA home theater projector that feature a native contrast ratio of 15,000:1 without the use of an iris mechanism, and roughly 10 megapixels. JVC showcased a prototype 1.27" D-ILA imager at InfoComm 2007.</p>
<p>The 4K2K D-ILA imaging device has a pixel pitch of just 6.8um and a 0.25um gap between pixels that allow a 93% aperture ratio.&nbsp;The 4096 x 2400 pixel format is compatible with the 4K Digital Cinema standard promoted by the Digital Cinema Initiative (DCI).</p>
<p>We are just starting to get used to 1080p TVs and now there is 4K2K. I am sure the video on a 4K2K display with 4K2K video will simply look amazing. I wonder when we will see a 60" 4K2K TV prices come down to below where normal folks can purchase.</p>
