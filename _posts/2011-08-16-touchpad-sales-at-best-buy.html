<p>Arik Hesseldahl, <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20110816/ouchpad-best-buy-sitting-on-a-pile-of-unsold-hp-tablets/">AllThingsD</a>:</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to one source who&acirc;&euro;&trade;s seen internal HP reports, Best Buy has taken delivery of 270,000 TouchPads and has so far managed to sell only 25,000, or less than 10 percent of the units in its inventory.</p></p>
<p>A second person who has seen Best Buy&acirc;&euro;&trade;s TouchPad sales figures confirmed the results as &acirc;&euro;&oelig;consistent with what I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve seen,&acirc;&euro; and went so far as to say that 25,000 sold might be &acirc;&euro;&oelig;charitable.&acirc;&euro; This source suggested that the 25,000-unit sales number may not account for units that consumers return to stores for a refund.</p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>HP recently dropped the price of the 16GB TouchPad from $499.99 to $399.99 probably because sales to actual customers were dismal. At $499.99 the TouchPad was just as expensive as the iPad. Who would want to gamble on an unproven tablet platform when you could get an iPad? And even at a price that's $100 cheaper, the question becomes: "Do I spend $100 extra and get the tried and true no-risk iPad?" Except for around 25,000 folks, so far the answer has been a resounding Yes.</p></p>
