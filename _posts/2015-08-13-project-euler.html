<p>[ <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/06/how-i-failed-failed-and-finally-succeeded-at-learning-how-to-code/239855/?single_page=true">The Atlantic</a> ] James Somers:</p>
<blockquote><p>Imagine a future in which the best way to learn how to do something -- how to write prose, how to solve differential equations, how to fly a plane -- is to download software, not unlike today's chess engines, that takes you from zero to sixty by way of a delightfully addictive inductive chain.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> is like this future (without all the fancy graphics and animations); I have signed up and am looking forward to learning how to program by solving problems.</p>
