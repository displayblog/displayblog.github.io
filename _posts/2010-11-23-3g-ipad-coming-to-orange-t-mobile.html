<p><a href="https://interest.orange.co.uk/default.aspx">Orange</a> &rarr; <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/22/orange-set-to-3g-ipad-on-contract-in-uk-200-price-rumored/">Engadget</a>: Apple's iPad WiFi + 3G will soon be available at Orange and T-Mobile. Engadget is postulating a &Acirc;&pound;200 price with a two-year contract. That's quite a bit cheaper than the prices in the US.</p>
