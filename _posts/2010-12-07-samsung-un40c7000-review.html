<p>Dick De Jong at <a href="http://www.hdtvsolutions.com/Samsung_UN40C7000_LCD_TV_Review.htm">HDTV Solutions</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Samsung UN40C7000's rich display of 2D content makes me forgive its occasional hot spot hiccups that are still too prevalent in edge-lit LED displays. And its 3D performance is not the in-your-face experience that you might desire. [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>If you want a great display stay away from LCD TVs that sport edge-lit LED backlights, instead look for full LED backlights and local dimming technology. They cost more but the TV-watching experience will be more enjoyable. Also, thin is over-rated, unless you plan to mount the TV on the wall. The UN40C7000 is going for US$1399.98 at Amazon, but consider a Panasonic plasma instead if you're watching TV in dark rooms.</p>
