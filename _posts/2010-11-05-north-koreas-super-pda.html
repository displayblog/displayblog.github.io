<p><a href="http://ashen-rus.livejournal.com/10293.html">Show and Tell Pyongyang</a>: North Korea is jumping into the PDA market. If minimalism is your thing this PDA is it: no GPS, no WiFi, no 2G or 3G or 4G, no Bluetooth. It does have a resistive touch display and seems to be powered by Windows CE. What this PDA does have: dictionary, ebooks, a map of North Korea, foreign language dictionary, games, media players, photo viewer, a file manager, and a word processor. Priced at about $140 for the high-end 8GB model. I wonder who the target market is.</p>
