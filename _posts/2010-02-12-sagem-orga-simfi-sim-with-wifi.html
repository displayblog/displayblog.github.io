<p>Sagem Orga and Telefonica developed SIMFi, a SIM card that takes cellular signals and pumps it out as WiFi. What this means is that your GSM mobile phone can be used as a mobile WiFi hotspot where you can connect authenticated notebooks and other portable gadgets. This is a fantastic idea and would make MiFi and the like obsolete. I have two concerns: battery life and EM radiation (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/02/05/cell-phone-health-hazard/">Cell Phone: Health Hazard?</a></em>).
