<p>Chunghaw Telecom (CHT) plans to bring RIM's BlackBerry smartphones to Taiwan in the first half of 2010. Taiwan Mobile has enjoyed a monopoly on BlackBerry sales so far. Most likely prices for BlackBerry smartphones as well as associated calling and data plans will fall. CHT will also work with Senao International (CHT holds 30% share) to promote Apple's iPhone in Taiwan. Source: <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20100301PD206.html">DIGITIMES</a></p>
