<p><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-11-29/apple-lawyers-up-for-patent-showdowns-with-nokia.html">BusinessWeek</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple has been the most-sued technology company since 2008, the year after the iPhone was introduced, topping Microsoft Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Dell Inc., according to LegalMetric Inc., a compiler of litigation data based in St. Louis.</blockquote></p>
<p>The legal cast include outside counsels:</p>
<ul>
<li>William Lee of Boston-based WilmerHale</li>
<li>Rubert Krupka of Kirkland & Ellis</li>
<li>Matt Powers of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>In addition to Bruce Sewell who joined Apple last year as the company's general counsel and Senior VP of Legal and Government Affairs reporting directly to Steve Jobs, Apple hired Noreen Krall as in-house attorney focusing on intellectual property litigation.</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple is squaring off this week against Nokia Oyj, the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s largest mobile-phone maker, before the International Trade Commission. The dispute, in which each side alleges intellectual property violations, is also a precursor to Apple patent battles with Motorola Inc. and HTC Corp.</blockquote></p>
