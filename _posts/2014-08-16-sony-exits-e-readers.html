<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28663878">BBC News</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;We do not have plans to develop a successor Reader model at this time,&acirc;&euro;¬ù the Japanese firm told the BBC.</p>
<p>The PRS-T3 was the last version made and will exist as long as supplies remain in Europe.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Sony pulled out of selling e-books and directed its users in the US and Europe to the e-bookstore of rival Kobo.</blockquote></p>
<p>Sony seems to be consolidating and focusing.</p>
