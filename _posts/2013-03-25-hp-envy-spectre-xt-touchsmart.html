<p>Sean Hollister, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/25/4143200/hp-envy-spectre-xt-touchsmart-review">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[...] the 15-inch, 1080p IPS touchscreen display might be the best on a consumer-grade HP laptop yet. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s exceptionally crisp and colorful &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HllljFHpsOw">this Oblivion movie trailer</a> looks positively fantastic in 1080p &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; and it has nice wide viewing angles too. Still, it can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t stand with the very best we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve seen, like the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/25/4023830/google-chromebook-pixel-review">Chromebook Pixel</a>, the Zenbook Prime, and the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/13/3082649/macbook-pro-review-retina-display-15-inch">Macbook Pro with Retina Display</a>. For one thing, it doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t get nearly as bright as some of its competition: I had to set brightness to 80 percent to use the XT TouchSmart comfortably in a dark room.</blockquote></p>
<p>The HP Envy Spectre XT TouchSmart seems to sport a very good display, but could use a little more oomph from the backlight.</p>
