<p>Chris Martin, <a href="http://mobile.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/laptop/3573470/samsung-exits-laptop-market-including-chromebooks/">PC Advisor</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Things have been quiet from Samsung this year on the laptop side of things with no new devices at IFA 2014 in Berlin. [...]</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;We quickly adapt to market needs and demands. In Europe, we will be discontinuing sales of laptops including Chromebooks for now. This is specific to the region &ndash; and is not necessarily reflective of conditions in other markets,&acirc;&euro;¬ù said a Samsung spokesperson.</blockquote></p>
<p>Is it the notebook market? Samsung? Europe?</p>
