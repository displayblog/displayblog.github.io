<p><img class="size-full wp-image-8195 aligncenter" title="LG_Display_23inch_Full_HD_1080p_3D_LCD_Monitor_BW" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/LG_Display_23inch_Full_HD_1080p_3D_LCD_Monitor_BW.jpg" alt="LG_Display_23inch_Full_HD_1080p_3D_LCD_Monitor_BW" width="480" height="411" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20091203PR202.html">DIGITIMES</a>: LG Display announced the commercial availability of its 23-inch 3D LCD sporting a 1920x1080 pixel format. The company's "high performance 3D exclusive controller" processes more than twice the image data compared to other 3D LCDs. Up to now LG Display adopted its proprietary copper bus line only to its 30-inch 2560x1600 LCD panel. </p>
<p>The company has incorporated its copper bus line technology to the new 23-inch 3D LCD that improves resolution and picture quality. The 3D display can produce both 2D and 3D images and is user switchable. Since LG Display is a LCD panel supplier expect LG Electronics and other monitor brands to introduce 23-inch 3D LCD monitors in the near future.</p>
