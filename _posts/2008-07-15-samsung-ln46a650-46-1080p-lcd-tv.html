<p><a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/consumer/detail/features.do?group=televisions&amp;type=televisions&amp;subtype=lcdtv&amp;model_cd=LN46A650A1FXZA">Samsung</a>: The Samsung LN46A650 is a 46" 1080p LCD TV sporting the company's Touch of Color design theme that infuses a bit of color (in this case, red) into the casing. The dynamic contrast ratio of 50,000:1 should provide really great images while watching motion picture. And the motion picture should have little to no motion blur thanks to motion blur busting 120Hz frequencies combined with a relatively fast response time of 4ms. </p>
<p>Samsung's Auto Motion Plus 120Hz technology incorporates motion interpolation, which inserts an extra frame by calculating an extra frame based on the previous and next frames to generate an ultra-smooth picture. The only thing missing is a LED backlight, but for $2299.99, Samsung's LN46A650 can be considered quite a bargain for all the features you get.</p>
<p><em>Update 2008.12.10 11:32AM PST</em>: LCD TV prices have come down quite a bit in the last couple of months. The LN46A650 can now be had for just $1554.12 at Amazon.com. Customer reviews, there are 486 of them, are very positive with 428 giving the LN46A650 5 out of 5 stars. If you are very sensitive to glare, make sure lighting is optimally placed (or turned off). The combination of 120Hz, 1080p capability, fast response times, great viewing angle and contrast ratio should yield some very impressive pictures!</p>
