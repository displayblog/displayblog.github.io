<p><a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6115/hp-2311xi-ips-monitor/">Chris Heinonen, AnandTech</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the price, the HP 2311xi comes out as a very good performer, with out of the box numbers that are great. That's good for those that want decent color on their display but don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t want to invest another $200 or more on hardware and software to calibrate it after they buy it. The lag numbers were great for gamers, and the power use was incredibly low as well.</blockquote></p>
<p>No adjustable stand, no VESA mounting holes, but the price is right for a 23-inch 1920x1080 IPS LCD monitor: US$200.</p>
