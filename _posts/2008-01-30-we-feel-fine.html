<p>I'm not even sure if I can explain this adequately.  Jonathan Harris and Sepandar Kamvar has been "harvesting human feelings" from weblogs since August 2005. The"We Feel Fine" system searches through the world's blog posts for the phrases "I feel" and "I am feeling" and then records the rest of the sentence and then logs what the feeling is. The image above might be a static image but the actual application is quite interactive. Have a go and you'll be pleasantly surprised at how well designed this application is. I was.</p>
<p>I was introduced to this fantastic merging of technology and art by my friend Rodney over some coffee at Starbucks. I want to believe that I am an artist inside with a fine mixing of technology all throughout. That's why I love beautifully designed stuff, from elegantly simple spoons to the wonderfully techno-fantastic iPhone. The "We Feel Fine" application can be the start of something new. By tapping the unlimited multimedia content on the Internet, we can start getting a "feel" for what is out there and this seems to be one of the most interesting implementations so far.</p>
