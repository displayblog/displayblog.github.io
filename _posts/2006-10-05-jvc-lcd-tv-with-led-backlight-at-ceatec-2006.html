<p>LED backlights will be the lighting technology of the future, and for some, now. JVC showcased a LCD TV using a LED backlight at CEATEC 2006. There are many advantages to having LEDs instead of CCFLs.</p>
<p>1. Better color gamut. LED: ~100% NTSC. CCFL: 72% --> 92% NTSC<br />
2. Longer life. LED light output decreases extremely slower over 50,000 hours. CCFL&Acirc;&nbsp; brightness comes down quite a bit through 50,000 hours.<br />
3. Instant on. LED chips do not need time to warm up. CCFLs do.<br />
But there are downsides...</p>
<p>1. LEDs pump out a lot of heat and need inactive and active thermal management. CCFLs are generally pretty darn cool.<br />
2.&Acirc;&nbsp; Hundreds if not&Acirc;&nbsp; thousands of LED chips are required on large LCD TVs.&Acirc;&nbsp; Only a&Acirc;&nbsp; couple of dozen for CCFL.<br />
3. LED backlights are expensive. CCFLs are pretty cheap in comparison.</p>
<p>There is much R&amp;D toward pumping out more light from LED chips, making them smaller in size and keeping them cool. We're at an inflection point and LED will take off real soon.</p>
