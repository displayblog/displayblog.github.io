<p><a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Amazon-Kindle-Fire-Teardown/7099/2">iFixit</a>:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Don't be fooled by the display's current state of black lifelessness. When powered on, the LG-manufactured 7" (diagonal) display gives users an eye-pleasing array of 16 million colors at a resolution of 1024 x 600 pixels.</li></p>
<li>Sharing the screen with friends and family is made easy thanks to the application of In-Plane Switching (IPS) which allows for a wider viewing angle.</li></ul></blockquote>
<p>From what I could find the LG Display manufactured LD070WS2 line of 7-inch LCDs have these specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brightness: 400 nits</li>
<li>Contrast Ratio: 800:1</li>
<li>Viewing Angles: 85/85/85/85</li>
<li>BLU Light Source: LED</li>
<li>Colors: 16.7 million</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>I'm not certain the LD070WS2-SL05 is 8-bit. Most likely it's 6-bit plus A-FRC to simulate 16.7 million colors. Another interesting spec is the 170/170 viewing angle. Most IPS LCDs sport viewing angles of 178/178 with a minimum contrast ratio of 10:1.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/5128/amazon-kindle-fire-review">Anand Lai Shimpi, AnandTech</a>, took display measurements and they look quite good:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brightness (white): 399 nits</li>
<li>Brightness (black): 0.45 nits</li>
<li>Contrast Ratio: 892:1</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>The Kindle Fire beats the iPad and iPad 2 in terms of white brightness, comes behind both iPads in black levels, and lands in between the two iPads in contrast ratio.</p>
