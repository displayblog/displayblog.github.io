<p><a href="http://www.corning.com/news_center/news_releases/2012/2012010501.aspx">Corning</a> will be unveiling its Gorilla Glass 2 at CES. I'll update here as soon as I get more information.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> Thanks to <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/1/7/2690375/corning-gorilla-glass-2-thinness">Jacob Schulman at The Verge</a> one thing we do know is that Gorilla Glass 2 will be thinner. The tag line at Corning's CES booth reads, "The damage resistance you demand, at a thinness that will astound you."</p>
<p><em>Update 2:</em> <a href="http://www.corning.com/news_center/news_releases/2012/2012010901.aspx">Corning issued a press release</a> and the main thing is that it's 20% thinner with the same toughness.</p>
<p>And here's a crazy story about Steve Jobs, the iPhone, and how the Gorilla Glass got the kick in the ass it needed. In an interview with Adam Lashinsky, <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/12/27/walter-isaacson-steve-jobs/">Walter Isaacson</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Steve Jobs when he does the iPhone decides he doesn't want plastic, he wants really tough glass on it, and they don't make a glass that can be tough like they want. And finally somebody says to him, because they were making all of the glass in China for the fronts of the stores, says, "You ought to check with the people at Corning. They're kind of smart there." So, he flies to Corning, New York, sits there in front of the CEO, Wendell Weeks, and says, "This is what I want, a glass that can do this." So, Wendell Weeks says, "We once created a type of process that created something called Gorilla Glass." And Steve said, "No, no, no. Here's how you make really strong glass." And Wendell says, "Wait a minute, I know how to make glass. Shut up and listen to me." And Steve, to his credit, shuts up and listens, and Wendell Weeks describes a process that makes Gorilla Glass. And Steve then says, "Fine. In six months I want enough of it to make--whatever it is--a million iPhones." And Wendell says, "I'm sorry, we've actually never made it. We don't have a factory to make it. This was a process we developed, but we never had a manufacturing plant to do it." And Steve looks at him and says what he said to Woz, 20, 30 years earlier: "Don't be afraid, you can do it." Wendell Weeks tells me... Because I flew to Corning, because I just wanted to hear this story. Wendell Weeks tells me, "I just sat there and looked at the guy. He kept saying, 'Don't be afraid. You can do this.'"</p>
<p>Wendell Weeks said he called his plant in Kentucky that was making glass for LCD screens, and said, "Start the process now, and make Gorilla Glass."</blockquote></p>
