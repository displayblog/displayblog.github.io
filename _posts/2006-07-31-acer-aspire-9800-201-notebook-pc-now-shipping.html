<p>Back in April, Acer announced its Aspire 9800, the second notebook to have a HD-DVD drive...</p>
<p>I'm not sure exactly when Dell's 20" notebook, the <a href="http://www.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/xpsnb_m2010?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs">M2010</a>, became available, but the folks at <a href="http://www.notebookreview.com/default.asp?newsID=2872&amp;laptop=Acer+9800">NotebookReview</a> is claiming that Acer, with its Aspire 9800, is the first to hit the market with a 20" notebook. Since they are the experts, I'm sure they are right. I <a href="http://displayblog.wordpress.com/2006/05/31/dell-xps-m2010-20-notebook-pc/">blogged about Dell's M2010</a> and thought the screen resolution was a bit low at only 1680 x 1050. Well, the Aspire 9800 has the same resolution on a large 20": 1680 x 1050. That is just too low! You can't even watch 1080p (though there isn't that much 1080p content at the moment) or play games at 1920 x 1200. Just terrible. The HD-DVD option would be simply wasted on a less-than-Full HD screen. At a price estimated to be around <a href="http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=1685">$2600</a>, this is really not a great multimedia offering.<br />
Other specifications are a bit better:</p>
<p>-Intel Core Duo CPU<br />
-nVidia GeForce Go 7600 GPU w/256MB<br />
-DVD-D connectivity<br />
-240GB HDD (120GB x 2)<br />
-"Superdrive" or HD-DVD<br />
