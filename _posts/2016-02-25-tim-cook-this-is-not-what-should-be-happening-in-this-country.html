<p>[ <a href="https://www.onthewire.io/cook-this-is-not-what-should-be-happening-in-this-country/">On The Wire</a> ] Dennis Fisher:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If a court can ask us to write this software, think about what else they could ask us to write. Maybe it&rsquo;s an operating system for surveillance, maybe the ability for law enforcement to turn on the camera,&rdquo; Cook told ABC News.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where this stops, but I do know this isn&rsquo;t what should be happening in this country.&rdquo;</blockquote></p>
<p>If this country continues down this route it doesn't take a rocket scientist to foresee a lot of technology companies moving out in the near future. I don't think the majority of tech companies in this country want to become an arm of the FBI, NSA, or other government organization.</p>
