<p><a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/495759307346952192">Tweeted by Elon Musk (@elonmusk) on August 3, 2014</a>. AI is coded by us, and can be applied broadly throughout. A single gadget with an incredible AI but with a bug in the code could cause some harm, but it can be limited. The harm brought upon by a broadly implemented buggy AI could be devastating.</p>
