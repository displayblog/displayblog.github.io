<p><a href="http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/news_archive/17.htm">TFT Central</a>: LG has introduced its W2420R, a 24-inch LCD monitor geared for professionals that require extreme levels of color fidelity. The 24-inch LCD panel is of the S-IPS (Super In-Plane Switching) variety that feature very good viewing angles, a color gamut of 135% NTSC and a 12-bit lookup table. Not only that, there is very little color shift at different viewing angles on IPS LCD panels. The 6ms GTG is average as is the 250 cd/m2 brightness.</p>
<p>The best part about the W2420R is the LED backlight: it's not the white LED variety; it's the RGB LED kind. That's how you get such a high color gamut. The body itself doesn't look all that special except for maybe the polished base. I do like simple and the W2420R is quite that. The high-end 24-incher from LG comes with a software and hardware color calibration tool to make sure that colors are exactly as they should be.</p>
