<p>JVC&acirc;&euro;&trade;s GZ-MG505 has three 1.33MP (1.23MP effective) CCDs for red, green and blue (RGB). JVC&acirc;&euro;&trade;s pixel shift technology somehow quadruple the pixel count to record still pictures with 5 megapixels. That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s still pictures. In video mode, the GZ-MG505 is a bit purer: 774,180 effective pixels for each color (RGB) resulting in a 2.3 megapixel video image. With the 30GB hard disk (which I think is one of those &acirc;&euro;&oelig;duh!&acirc;&euro;¬ù features that everyone should be putting on camcorders) you can store up to 37 hours of video content. MSRP is a whopping $1299.99.</p>
<p>For that kind of money, I might just have to shell out and get the <a href="http://www.jvc.com/product.jsp?modelId=MODL027384&amp;pathId=119&amp;page=1">GZ-MC500US</a> that lets you record in MPEG2 (720 x 480 - DVD resolution) with Dolby Digital Audio. The only thing about this is that you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re limited to how big CFs can get. Currently they are at 8GB, but still much smaller than the 30GB in the GZ-MG505.</p>
