<p>And that is why Hitachi has gone hunting for original design manufacturers (ODM) and/or original equipment manufacturers (OEM). Makoto Ebata, VP at Hitachi told reporters that &acirc;&euro;&oelig;It is important that we provide customers a full product lineup that includes LCD TVs.&acirc;&euro;¬ù Yes, he wants from dirt cheap to really expensive and since Hitachi has expensive, they need to bolster the really cheap end of the spectrum. He wants simpler and cheaper LCD TVs. Well, there goes another decent brand down the drain. Hitachi, Made in China. Makes me cringe. Although LCD TVs don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have any batteries that can blow up, maybe the Chinese manufacturers will start making CCFLs that blow up.</p>
