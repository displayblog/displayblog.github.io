<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dell">Dell</a>'s new 2709WFP has not been officially announced, but CNET has a quick review of it online already. No official pictures either. With a pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1200">1920 x 1200</a> plastered across a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=27"">27"</a> diagonal LCD the default fonts on Windows and OS X will be much easier to look at compared to say a 24". So for those of you who like bigger fonts and menus, without having to tinker around with settings, the 2709WFP has got you covered.</p>
<p>No more physical buttons. The 2709WFP has <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=touch">touch</a> buttons, five of them in blue, on the right side of the monitor. The blue buttons are touch sensitive and is integrated into the bezel and has the same matte texture. When you have no need of them anymore, the blue buttons simply disappear. To make it reappear? Just hold your hand near the bottom right of the bezel and the light above the power button comes back to life. Cool.</p>
