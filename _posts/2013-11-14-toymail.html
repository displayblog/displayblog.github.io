<p><a href="http://toymailco.com">ToyMail</a> co-founder Gauri Nanda:</p>
<blockquote><p>Toymail is like voicemail or email but way more fun because your messages are sent to toys to speak back. First our team created the Mailmen&acirc;&bdquo;&cent;, the toys that deliver your Toymail. Then we developed an app where you connect to kids you know, record them a message, and send it right from your phone to their toys.</p>
<p>Part of what drove us in creating the Mailmen was this desire to be able to say whatever might be our minds to the kids we love when we aren't around to say it in person. And the reality is that most parents are away from their kids more often than they would like, sometimes all day, sometimes days at a time. Toymail is for them. It's for grandparents, aunts, uncles, even people like me- I don't have kids of my own, but I am completely in love with my best friend's kids, and not a day goes by that I don't want to say something to them and hear all the crazy, brilliant things they might say back.</p>
<p>We didn't want to create another toy that puts a kid in front of a screen. We believe there's a better way to approaching technology for kids, and that's by making toys social.</blockquote></p>
