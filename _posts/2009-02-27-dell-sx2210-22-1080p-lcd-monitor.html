<p><a href="http://accessories.dell.com/sna/products/Displays/productdetail.aspx?c=ca&amp;l=en&amp;s=corp&amp;sku=320-7976">Dell Canada</a>: The tilt-only SX2210 is Dell's newest 22" 1080p LCD monitor. The SX2210 sports a 1920x1080 pixel format and directly linked to that is the 16:9 aspect ratio for your HD viewing enjoyment. The ultra-fast 2ms response time will be good for both sports and gaming. Contrast ratio of 1000:1 is very good for a monitor. This 22-incher is probably using a TN (Twisted Nematic) LCD panel by the looks of the limited viewing angles: 170/160. That would be 170 horizontal and 160 vertical--the description on Dell's page got it switched, but to Dell's credit it shows the correct information in the "Tech Specs" tab. The SX2210 comes with a ton of connections: USB, VGA, DVI-D, HDMI. The color gamut is also a bit more than standard at 85% NTSC, most likely due to a WCG-CCFL.</p>
<p>The SX2210 is a fine-looking 22" LCD monitor, especially given that it's from Dell; Dell has come quite a ways. The fast response time of just 2ms will come in handy for viewing sports in HD as well as playing games. Need serious color work? The SX2210 is a mixed bag with a higher-than-average 85% NTSC color gamut but less-than-ideal viewing angles. Depending on the price the SX2210 can be a very good monitor for you as long as height-adjustment isn't necessary.</p>
