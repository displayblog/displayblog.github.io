<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://kottke.org/12/01/working-in-solitude-on-the-decline">Jason Kottke</a>. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/opinion/sunday/the-rise-of-the-new-groupthink.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all">Susan Cain</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Solitude is out of fashion. Our companies, our schools and our culture are in thrall to an idea I call the New Groupthink, which holds that creativity and achievement come from an oddly gregarious place. Most of us now work in teams, in offices without walls, for managers who prize people skills above all. Lone geniuses are out. Collaboration is in.</blockquote></p>
<p>Why solitude is important, in the words of Picasso:</p>
<blockquote><p>Without great solitude, no serious work is possible.</blockquote></p>
<p><em>Update:</em> University of California psychology professor and creativity expert <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1665840/an-hr-lesson-from-steve-jobs-if-you-want-change-agents-hire-pirates">Dean Keith</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Being aggressive, egocentric, or antisocial makes it easier to ponder ideas in solitude or challenge convention. Meanwhile, resistance to change or a willingness to give up easily can derail new initiatives.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote><p>I have never written an advertisement in the office. Too many interruptions. I do all my writing at home.</blockquote></p>
