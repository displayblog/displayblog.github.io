<blockquote><p>HTC will likely use Full HD panels made by Sharp for its reported soon-to-be released M7 smartphone due to low OLED yields from Taiwan-based panel maker AU Optronics (AUO), according to industry sources.</blockquote></p>
<p>The HTC M7 is rumored to sport a 4.7-inch 1920x1080 LCD good for a resolution of 468 ppi.</p>
