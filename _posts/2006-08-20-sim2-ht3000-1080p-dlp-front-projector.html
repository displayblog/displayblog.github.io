<p>SIM2's HT3000 is the newest of its Grand Cinema line using a DLP single-chip solution that has 1920 x 1080 resolution. Video is processed at 10 bits allowing for a more pure picture quality.</p>

<p>The HT3000 was announced during CES 2006 in Las Vegas earlier this year and started shipping as of August 15. The unit has two HDMI ports, a 7-segment color wheel and will go for a MSRP of $15,995. Yow, that's a lot of money. Too much in fact. Why?</p>
<p>Just around the corner are DLP units with LED backlights. One of the great benefits of LED backlights is the elimination of the color wheel that can lead to a "rainbow effect" that seem to plague some viewers. Another benefit of LED backlights is the longevity: you need not replace the Ultra-High Performance (UHP) lamps every 3-4 years.</p>
