<p>HDSPA stands for High Speed Downlink Packet Access and is a data service using packets and a feature of the WCDMA standard, which provides data transmissions up to 8-10Mbps (mega-bits per second). Pretty fast!</p>
<p>On August 2, Samsung launched the SGH-Z560, the world's first HSDPA phone, at <a href="http://www.3gsmworldcongress.com/">3GSM 2006 World Congress</a> in Barcelona, Spain. In France and Italy, it will be the SGH-ZV50. The SGH-Z560 supports 1.8Mbps data transmissions, EDGE (Enhanced Data-rate for GSM Evolution) and sports a slim 16mm thickness. It has a 2 megapixel camera with auto-focus. 30MB of internal memory (not a lot) is included with a microSD memory slot.</p>
