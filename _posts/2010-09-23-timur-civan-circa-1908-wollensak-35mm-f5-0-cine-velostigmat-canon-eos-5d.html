<p>Combine a circa 1908 Wollensak 35mm F5.0 Cine-Velostigmat and a Canon EOS 5D and you've got... words really can't describe it... history in the making. Literally. The photographs look as though they were caught a hundred years ago. Take a look at the photograph above that Timur Civan (<a href="http://www.timurcivan.com">www.timurcivan.com</a>) took using the frankensteinian apparatus. Absolutely brilliant!</p>

<p><em>Original photograph was scaled to 600 pixels wide and then sharpened a little. Sourced from Cinema5D and photographed by Timur Civan.</em> </p>
<p>This was made possible with the aid of a Russian lens technician mad scientist friend in New York who found the century-old lens and crafted to fit Canon's EF mount. I hope this Russian genius will lend his services to craft other magnificent lenses to fit modern cameras.</p>
