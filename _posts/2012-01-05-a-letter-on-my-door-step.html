<blockquote><p>This letter wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t mailed &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; it was at my doorstep when I got home a couple months ago. I read it, I cried, and read it again &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; probably a hundred times by now. It wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t easy to read &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; and honestly, as much as it validates what I do for a living &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; I wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t sure I was going to share it either. If you choose to read through the letter, you will know why I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve finally chosen to share it.</blockquote></p>
<p>Take lots and lots of photos of the ones you love.</p>
