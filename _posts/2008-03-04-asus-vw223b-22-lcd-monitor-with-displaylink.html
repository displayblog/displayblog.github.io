The VW223B from ASUS is a 22" LCD monitor, but with a twist. With a little magic from DisplayLink, the VW223B can be connected to your computer via USB. And that's not all. You can daisy-chain up to six of them. I was given the opportunity to see this first hand at CES 2008 and was very impressed. There were no performance degradation and the sixth LCD display showing a video clip looked just as sharp as the first one surfing the net.<br />
