<p><a href="http://ignorethecode.net/blog/2011/05/09/pentile_oled_screens/">Lukas Mathis</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For example, red text on a black background looks like only every other pixel is turned on; this makes straight lines look ragged. Letters look serrated; the letter &Acirc;&laquo;S&Acirc;&raquo; looks as if it had two little horns sticking out at the top. Solid red areas look like tiny checkerboards. The same applies to blue things, although the effect is less obvious. Straight white lines look like dashed lines. Grey things sometimes look fuzzy.</blockquote></p>
