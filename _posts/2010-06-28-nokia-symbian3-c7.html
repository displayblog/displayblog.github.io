<p>A new less-than-N8 seems to be lurking around Nokia. C7-00, part of Nokia's C-series, slots beneath the N series and sports what the company calls a nHD pixel display. Another day, another display-related jargon: nHD. What does nHD stand for? In landscape it refers to a pixel format of 640x360. Not quite the highest resolution around since most smartphones seem to come with 800x480. According to <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/28/symbian-3-c7-with-nhd-display-confirmed-on-nokias-own-site/">Engadget</a> the <a href="http://nds.nokia.com/uaprof/NC7-00r100.xml">parsed XML code</a> has the C7 sporting 3G UMTS, HSDPA, WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity.</p>
