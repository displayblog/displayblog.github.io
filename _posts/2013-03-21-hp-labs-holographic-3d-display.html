<p>Katherine Bourzac, <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/512716/new-3-d-display-could-let-phones-and-tablets-produce-holograms/">MIT Technology Review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A new kind of three-dimensional display developed at HP Labs plays hologram-like videos without the need for any moving parts or glasses. Videos displayed on the HP system hover above the screen, and viewers can walk around them and experience an image or video from as many 200 different viewpoints&mdash;like walking around a real object.</blockquote></p>
