<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7450 aligncenter" title="Dell_Adamo_Desire_Speed_Boost" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Dell_Adamo_Desire_Speed_Boost.jpg" alt="Dell_Adamo_Desire_Speed_Boost" width="449" height="470" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.dell.com/business/laptops?~ck=mn#subcats=laptop-adamo&amp;navla=&amp;a=">Dell</a>: The Dell Adamo Desire has been upgraded. The ultra-thin Adamo notebook PC originally sported a puny 1.4GHz CPU coupled with a 128GB SSD. Dell rightly thought it was too slow and a bit light on storage. So the updated version sports a 2.1GHz Intel Core 2 Duo SL9600 CPU and storage is doubled to 256GB SSD. RAM is plentiful at 4GB and fast (DDR3). The 64-bit version of Windows 7 Home Premium is the OS. The price was originally US$2,299 and the updated version... is the same.</p>
