<p class="P1">It is final, according to DigiTimes. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sharp">Sharp</a>'s <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=g10">G10</a> (generation 10) LCD plant will be able to process glass substrates with a dimension of 2880 x 3080mm. This is slightly larger than the 2850 x 3050mm that was considered. Sharp will focus on manufacturing <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=57"">57"</a> and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=65"">65"</a> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a> and large public display panels at its G10 plant. The G10 plant is also capable of cutting fifteen <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=42"">42"</a> LCD panels. This will certainly put a lot of pressure on PDP manufacturers as they have been fighting tooth-and-nail in the 40"-class TV sizes starting in early 2006 when <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=g7">G7</a> plants began volume producing 40"-class <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a> panels. With G8, the battle for the 50"-class TV market will heat up later this year. Sharp already volume produces at its G8 while Samsung's G8 just started this month.</p></p>
<p class="P1"><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lg-display">LG.Philips LCD</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lpl">LPL</a>) has not made public its plans to build a next generation LCD plant. LPL currently has a G7 LCD plant that can process 1950 x 2250mm glass substrates, which are optimized for 40"-class LCD panels. LPL will either follow <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=samsung">Samsung</a>'s G8 size or Sharp's G10 size. I cannot see LPL doing both as funding the expansion for both becomes very expensive.</p></p>
