<p>For just $49.99 per month with a contract (presumably 2 years) you can get Sprint's Overdrive that connects to WiMAX and EV-DO signals and pumps out WiFi. Nice. Verizon's MiFi seems to be slightly limited and a bit over-priced at $60 per month for just EV-DO. But do I want these mobile hotspots to be blasting WiFi signals (strong enough for a 100-foot range for the Overdrive) through my biological spots? Maybe Bluetooth is a safer option.
