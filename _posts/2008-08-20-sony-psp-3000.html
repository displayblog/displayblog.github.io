<p><a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2008/08/20/sony-officially-announces-psp-3000/">joystiq</a> <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/08/20/sony-gets-official-with-psp-3000/">Engadget</a>: The Sony PSP-3000 is externally identical except for a built-in mic and a LCD that is "better outside with no glare". The built-in mic is certainly an indication that voice-based communications will be a part of the PSP-3000. Regarding the LCD, no glare is good. Better outside? I hope that doesn't mean worse inside. Transflective, or more accurately transreflective, incorporate the best of both worlds. The transreflective LCD is a transmissive design that allows light to come through from the backlight unit, but also has reflective coatings to make use of ambient light such as the sun. The benefit is that you can see the contents of the LCD fairly well even when the sun is out in its full glory. The potential disadvantage is that the overall LCD image might suffer a bit due to the additionally incorporated elements. That's 'potential' disadvantage. I might have to secure a PSP-3000 just to test it out myself.</p>
<p><em>Update 2008.08.21 10:28PM PST:</em> According to <a href="http://japanese.engadget.com/2008/08/21/psp-3000-10/">engadget Japanese</a>, the PSP-3000 will have a vastly improved LCD. First off, the color gamut will be 2x, contrast ratio 5x, response time 1/2 compared to the PSP-2000. Looks like the new LCD is going to be a winner!</p>
