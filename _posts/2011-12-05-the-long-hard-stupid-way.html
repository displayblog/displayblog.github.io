<blockquote><p>It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a little talk about doing things the long, hard, stupid way, and the opportunity of beginning to think about our work as designers as a gift. It also jumps a bit into the issues that need to be overcome to be able to do so in this new digital context where most of our work now lives.</blockquote></p>
<p>Chimero's Do Lectures presentation is well worth your time.</p>
