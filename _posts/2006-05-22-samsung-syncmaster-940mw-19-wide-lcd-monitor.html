<p>There are two things unique to Samsung's new 19" monitor. First, a TV tuner that's compatible with NTSC, PAL and SECAM is built right into the 940MW. Second, it's the brand new wave of 19" LCD monitors that are hitting stores and in wide format.  The pixel format is 1440 x 900, a little different from what we're used to. If you remember, Apple's 17" PowerBook was the first to use this pixel format. I thought it was strange and I still think it's pretty strange. The total number of pixels is 1.296 megapixels. The "regular" 19" with 5:4 aspect ratio and 1280 x 1024 pixel format has a little over 1.31 megapixels. So, you're actually getting less with something new that's wide, and most likely, it will be more expensive. <a href="http://www.sci-tech-today.com/story.xhtml?story_id=10200BKQH040"><br />

<p>-19" wide, 16:10 aspect ratio<br />
-1400 x 900 pixel format<br />
-700:1 CR-12ms response time (Sci-Tech Today thinks this is "ultra fast" when we have fast response times in the 2ms-8ms range. I would say this response time is pretty average if not in the slower side)<br />
-TV tuner w/NTSC, PAL, SECAM support-$679.99 (very expensive)</p>
