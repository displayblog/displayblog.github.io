<p>TechCrunch reports that a France Telecom executive confirmed a tablet from Apple is coming. The executive? Stephane Richard, the number two at the company, told French journalist Jean-Pierre Elkabbach the tablet is coming, and with a webcam. But.</p>
<p>Daring Fireball's John Gruber makes a good point that: "Carriers do not get to see Apple products in advance." He points to Stan Sigman, CEO of Cingular, who admitted, "Cingular agreed to carry the iPhone without having seen it." I agree with John that that is certainly how it still is at Apple.</p>
<p>Will the tablet come with a webcam? The answer is that no one knows outside of a few key people at Apple. Mr. Richard certainly does not know.
