<p>The Kodak Easyshare V610 has one of the largest LCDs for a compact digital camera. The LCD is 2.8" and is one of the largest I've heard of. Of course there are larger one. I believe Samsung has a digicam (the <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/samsungpro815/">Pro815</a> to be exact) that holds the world record for largest TFT LCD screen on a digital still camera: 3.5". But the body on the Pro815 is much larger than Kodak's V610. The 2.8" TFT LCD on the V610 has 230,000 total pixels--on the high side for a compact digital camera.</p>

<p>As you can see from the picture, the 2.8" TFT LCD screen takes up much of the V610's back. More screen real estate the better. Although I am not for the complete removal of physical buttons as they provide much better tactile feedback than a touchscreen.</p>
