<blockquote><p>So that might be OK... assuming the technology is <em>only</em> used at concerts and doesn&rsquo;t extend to, like, disabling phone cameras during instances of police brutality and/or sociopolitical/religious unrest.</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple works with a lot of music companies and I'm certain some of those companies have complained loudly that concert goers have been bootlegging or live streaming concerts. I don't know how rampant this is, but I'm sure music companies want to stop it and want Apple's help. I wouldn't mind a geo-fenced camera disable feature on my iPhone when it comes to concerts. I haven't gone to a concert in many years, but I've seen concert videos with hundreds of phone screens. What a terrible way to experience a concert.</p>
