<p><a href="http://global.epson.com/newsroom/2011/news_20110517.html">Epson</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>E Ink will manufacture, sell and support the newly developed 300-dpi ePaper displays, which measure 9.68 inches on the diagonal and have 2,400 x 1,650 pixels. These paper-like, high-resolution displays demonstrate in full the very best features of ePaper: crisp and clear text and images on an easy-on-the-eyes screen, a thin and light form factor, and ultra-low power consumption.</blockquote></p>
<p>Epson will build the display controller for the 9.68-inch 300-ppi e-paper. The 2400x1650 pixel format e-paper is being showcased during SID 2011. I'll be taking a look at this high resolution e-paper later on today. The size of the display is interesting in that the current Kindle DX sports a 9.7-inch E Ink. It is exciting to think of the possibility that the next generation Kindle DX might incorporate this new 300-ppi e-paper from E Ink.</p>
