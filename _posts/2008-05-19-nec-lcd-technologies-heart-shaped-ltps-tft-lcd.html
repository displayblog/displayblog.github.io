<p>On May 19, 2008, <a href="http://www.nec-lcd.com/en/release/release_080519.html">NEC LCD Technologies</a> announced a prototype heart-shaped Low Temperature Poly-Silicon (LTPS) TFT LCD panel. The unique LCD is formed using two half-circular arcs and two straight lines. The LCD display has a width of 4.0cm and a height of 3cm. The heart-shaped LCD will be showcased during SID at the LA Convention Center.</p>

<p>NEC applied its value-integrated TFT (VIT) technology and integrated the driver ICs into the module along the perimeter of the LCD glass. This allows for simplification of interconnection schematics allowing a 2.0mm bezel.</p>

<p>NEC just missed out on Mother's Day. Maybe next year we'll get to purchase some heart-shaped or tear-drop necklace digital photo pendants (there, I coined a term). You can see <a href="http://www.nec-lcd.com/en/release/release_080519_01.pdf">more possible shapes here</a> (PDF).</p>
