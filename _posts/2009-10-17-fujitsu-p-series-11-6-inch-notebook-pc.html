<p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">The Good &amp; Bad:</strong> The 7 hours of battery life is certainly a positive. For a 11.6-incher it is a bit on the porky side at thicker than an inch and weighing 3.5 pounds. CPU power seems to be a bit lacking too with the top end sporting a 1.3 GHz Pentium SU4100; it has two cores though. The price better be aggressive or the P Series doesn't have a chance against netbooks that are cheap and getting more powerful by the day. Source:&Acirc;&nbsp;<a href="Fujitsu has just announced two "stylish" P Series LifeBooks, and we have our hands on the PR drivel to prove it. This affable pair of machines come in "charming" colors that "endow both notebooks with a premium yet snazzy feel, for standing out effortlessly in a corporate jungle or a social playground setting." To be honest, we're more interested in things like the 11.6-inch (1366 x 768) display, battery life (6.7 hours under normal use, 7.2 hours in power saving mode -- which can be selected by hitting the ECO button), multitouch, the DVD Sharing application for glomming onto optical drives over your LAN, and the fact that they're both a mere 3.5 pounds light and just over an inch thin. The Fujitsu P LifeBook P3110 features a Pentium SU4100 (1.30GHz / 800MHz / 2MB L2 Cache) and is available in Glossy Black, Glossy Silver, and Glossy Ruby Red. The Fujitsu P LifeBook P3010, however, sports an AMD Athlon Neo MV-40 (1.6GHz / 512KB / L2 cache) and is available in Glossy Black and Glossy Ruby Red. No word on a release date, or on a price -- but, to paraphrase Godard, whenever someone mentions "style," we reach for our checkbooks. PR after the break.">Engadget</a></p>
