<p>According to <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/NewsShow/MailHome.asp?datePublish=2007/6/28&amp;pages=PB&amp;seq=202">DigiTimes</a>, there will be three TFT LCD manufacturers that will greatly benefit from Apple's iPhone. The three are Sharp, Epson and Toshiba Matsushita Display Technology (TMDisplay). Supplying the LCD to Apple for the iPhone is estimated to generate about US$160 million each for the three mentioned. The article also postulates a $45-$50 price tag on the LCD.</p>
<p>Let's do some fun calculations.<br />
Total revenue from LCDs: US$160 million x 3 = $480 million<br />
Total iPhone unit sales: $480 million / $45 =10.67 million unit or $480 / $50 = 9.6 million</p>
<p>Sounds to be about right. Of course the time frame for these numbers is from June 29, 2007 to the end of 2008. So that's revenue. I wonder what the profits are...</p>
