<p>Marco della Cava, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/09/09/tim-cook-interview-usa-today/15312749/">USA Today</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus both feature larger screens reminiscent of competitors&acirc;&euro;&trade; devices. By design, says Cook. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;It's an incredible opportunity for us to switch people from Android to iOS. So yes, this is epic. It is epic,&acirc;&euro;¬ù he says.</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple finally has crashed the large smartphone party. But is a large display enough for people to switch from Android to iOS? One of the reasons there are so many large Android smartphones in the wild is because they are free, with a two-year contract of course.</p>
<p>The large 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus is relatively expensive; the down payment starts at US$299 for the 16GB version. I'm sure some U.S. carriers will offer down payments for the iPhone 6 Plus that's less than that, but the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/04/22/lg-g3/">LG G3</a>, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/06/24/samsung-galaxy-tab-s-display-review-by-raymond-soneira/">Samsung Galaxy S5</a>, and HTC One M8 to name a few high-end Android smartphones can be had for $0 up front.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how many large Android smartphones users will jump ship to the iPhone 6 and what the split will be between the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch versions.</p>
