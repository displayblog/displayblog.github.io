<p><a href="http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?catalogId=10551&amp;storeId=10151&amp;langId=-1&amp;identifier=S_NEX_Handycam#/handycamCamcorderSection">Sony</a> &rarr; <a href="http://www.photographybay.com/2010/07/14/sony-nex-vg10-camcorder/">Photography Bay</a>: The Sony NEX-VG10 Interchangeable Lens HD Handycam Camcorder makes use of the same APS-C Exmor HD CMOS image sensor used in the company's latest NEX digital cameras. The image sensor is almost 20 times bigger than the sensors found in typical camcorders. Another exciting feature of the NEX-VG10 is the use of SLR lenses. And for just US$2000 you can shoot like the professionals, maybe even better. All of Sony's E-mount lenses can be used and with an adapter you can take your pick from the wide variety of Alpha-mount lenses.</p>
<p>Unlike DSLRs that can shoot video, the NEX-VG10 can really shoot video: 1080/60p in AVCHD format (or 1080/50p for PAL) at up to 24Mbps. Unfortunately the film standard 1080/24p isn't supported. But since the NEX-VG10, like the NEX digital cameras, are mostly about the chip and firmware I expect hackers the world over will get 1080/24p kicking in no time. Stills can be snapped too with 14 megapixels but only in JPG; RAW isn't supported. Yet. Videos and photos are stored in Memory Stick or SD cards. Up to four hours of 1080/60p HD video can be stored using a 32GB card.</p>
<p>Sony paid a lot of attention to sound. Get this: a Quad Capsule Spatial Array Stereo Microphone is used to capture stereo sound. The 3.0-inch Xtra Fine TruBlack LCD viewfinder has 921,000 pixels. There is also an electronic viewfinder. The NEX-VG10 will be available in September and comes with an image-stabilized E18-200mm f3.5-6.3 lens. Pre-orders start on July 14th.</p>
