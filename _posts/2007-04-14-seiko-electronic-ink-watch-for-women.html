<p style="text-align: left;">Seiko is pushing the boundaries of watch design. The company has incorporated E Ink's flexible electronic ink technology into a bracelet-like watch. I am quite impressed. The look and feel of the watch has not changed for a very long time and it is about time that companies like Seiko challenge our ideas about what a watch should look and feel like.</p></p>
