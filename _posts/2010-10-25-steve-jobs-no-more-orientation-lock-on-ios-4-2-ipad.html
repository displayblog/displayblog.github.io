<p>An email exchange between Steve Jobs and <a href="http://www.9to5mac.com/31982/jobs-there-wont-be-a-mute-switch-becomes-an-orientation-lock-option-for-ipad">9to5Mac</a> reader Robert reveals that the orientation lock on the iPad will be turned into a mute button, without the option of switching it back.</p>
<p>John Gruber, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/10/25/ipad-steve-jobs">Daring Fireball</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What&acirc;&euro;&trade;s weird about this change is that I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t think anyone is happy about it. It seems like Apple is standardizing for the sake of standardizing, not for improved usability. The iPhone and iPod Touch are, for many people, audio devices. But the iPad is a reading/viewing device for most of us.</blockquote></p>
<p>Maybe Steve thinks the iPad will be used more as a communications device than a reading device.</p>
