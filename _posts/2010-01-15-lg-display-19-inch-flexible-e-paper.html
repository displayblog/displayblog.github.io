<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/LG_Display_Flexible_19inch_ePaper_Display.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9122"  title="LG_Display_Flexible_19inch_ePaper_Display" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/LG_Display_Flexible_19inch_ePaper_Display.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="224" /></a><strong>LARGEST:</strong> LG Display announced a newspaper-sized e-paper. The 19-inch e-paper is 250 x 400mm in size and is about the size of an A3-sized newspaper and just as thin and light at 0.3mm and 130g. LG Display uses a metal foil instead of a typical glass substrate allowing the company's e-paper to be flexible with increased durability compared to glass-based displays. A gate-in-panel (GIP) technology was used to integrate the gate driver IC directly onto the panel furthering improving flexibility.</p>
<p><strong>SOON:</strong> According to LG Display, the 19-inch flexible e-paper is the largest flexible display and provides a reading experience very similar to a real newspaper. We don't know when the 19-inch e-paper will be commercially available but the smaller 11.5-inch version is expected to hit the market in the first half of 2010.</p>
<p><strong>SMALLER:</strong> A real newspaper you can fold and then put under your arm or into your briefcase. I'm not sure if you can do that with the 19-inch flexible e-paper: if you have a large enough briefcase, sure, but most of us will probably want something a bit smaller.
