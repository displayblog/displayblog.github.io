<blockquote><p>The reigning champs in the massive-display contest were the Dallas Cowboys, whose 72-foot tall, 160-foot-wide LED monstrosity, completed in 2009, hovers ominously over center field. As Beaton&acirc;&euro;&trade;s graphic shows, while the Texans&acirc;&euro;&trade; new screens are a bit shorter than the Cowboys&acirc;&euro;&trade;, they&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll be a good deal wider, at 277 feet.</blockquote></p>
<p>New York-based graphic designer Daniel Beaton created infographics comparing NFL stadium screen sizes. The Reliant Stadium's 277-foot wide display is <em>big</em>.</p>
