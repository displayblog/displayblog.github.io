<p><a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/04/11/apples-iphone-6-lineup-should-be-great.aspx">Ashraf Eassa, The Motley Fool</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Samsung's Galaxy Note 3 is a big, immensely popular phone that sports a beastly 5.7" display. Indeed, much to Samsung's credit, the large-screened Galaxy Note series has really been a commercial success, as customers seek to do even more "PC-like" functionality on their phones. Apple, likely realizing the market share gain opportunity in releasing a larger iPhone, is apparently set to launch a 5.5" iPhone in Q4, with mostly the same specifications, the main difference being a 1920x1080 5.5" screen, according to Kuo.</blockquote></p>
<p>Personally, I don't see Samsung Galaxy Note 3 users trying to do more PC-like stuff on them. They like the Galaxy Note 3 for one reason: it is big. Icons are big. Texts are big. Webpages are big. The keyboard is big. Everything is big. Big is what a lot of people like. The stylus can be useful, but I've not seen it being used in the wild. Not once.</p>
<p>Market share gain opportunity? I think most people who closely follow Apple would disagree Apple does things to go after market share. If Apple is developing a 5.5-inch iPhone 6 it is because Apple thinks there's a lot of people who would like one. <em>I</em> would like one.</p>
<p>I've written on DisplayBlog many times and shared my preference for a smartphone I can use with just one hand. I still prefer the size of the iPhone 4 to the iPhone 5. If Apple had made the iPhone 4 thinner, lighter, with more battery life and called it the iPhone 5 I would have been happier. But there's something more important than being able to use a smartphone with one hand and that's getting my sanity back.</p>
<p>I don't want to have to carry more than one mobile device. Right now I have an iPhone and an iPad. That's two cables. Two devices to charge. Managing two sets of apps, two sets of settings. Two devices to buy accessories for. Two devices that can get damaged or lost. Two devices that randomly reboot or do something funky to ruin my day. I'd rather not have two; I'd rather have one. Life is complicated enough. With a single 5.5-inch iPhone I can ditch the smaller iPhone and the iPad. I'll need to figure out a comfortable and convenient way to carry around such a big iPhone though, but that's a small price to pay for not having to deal with two mobile devices. And the 1920x1080 pixel format perfectly matches a lot of 1080p content out there.</p>
