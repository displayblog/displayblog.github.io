<p>I have been searching for the perfect <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=24"">24"</a> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-monitor">LCD monitor</a> for a long time now. I really like <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=nec">NEC</a> LCD monitors but they tend to be really expensive: more than US$1000. And for that kind of price, I would rather spend a bit more and get a Dell 30". The NEC AccuSync 24WMCX gives me a bit of hope. The viewing angle (178/178), fast response time (5ms) and very bright (400 cd/m2) LCD seems to suggest that this NEC has got the chops but also doesn't require that I burn a whole in my wallet. HDTV Solutions has a good review and gives it 4 out of 5 stars. The only drawback would be that the 24WMCX does not rotate, but I don't see myself needing to rotate my monitor. Now if I can just confirm that the 24WMCX uses an <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=ips">IPS</a> panel, I would be all over it. Does anyone know?</p>
