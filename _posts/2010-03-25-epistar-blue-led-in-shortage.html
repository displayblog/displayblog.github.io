<p>According to Biing-jye Lee, chairman of Epistar, the company's blue LED manufacturing is currently at full capacity trying to fulfill orders that are 30-40% larger. Epistar supplies to Samsung but there are rumors claiming that Samsung is lowering its LED-backlit LCD TV shipment goal for the second quarter due to a slowdown in sales in China. Samsung is without doubt a large customer but even with a reduction in orders Epistar is expected to continue manufacturing blue LEDs at maximum capacity.</p>
<p>Epistar's AlGaInP LED production is only at 70% utilization but is slated to increase in the second quarter. Most of the customers for AlGaInP LEDs are Japanese. Lee stated demand from the LED lighting market will offset slowing growth in the LED-backlit LCD TV market in 2012.
