<blockquote><p>Made from black and white Moroccan cloth and constructed using traditional book binding techniques, the cover of the Limited Edition DODOcase for the iPad 2 is designed to fold back to be used as a stand. The date of the iPad 2 launch is expertly detailed on the side using classic book binding foil stamping techniques. An elastic strap keeps your iPad protected while on the go. Offering a new solid core bamboo, complete with a four-piece tray design the Limited Edition DODOcase perfectly matches the curvature of your iPad 2 and provides access to all buttons and ports.</blockquote></p>
<p>US$90. Looks quite nice. I wonder how well it'll do in light of the Smart Cover. If I had to choose between just the two, it'd be a difficult choice.</p>
