<blockquote><p>LGD was forced to reduce its shipments in the first quarter due to light leakage problem for panels produced at its 6G production lines. The company reportedly has fixed the problem and will resume shipment momentum to Apple in the second quarter, said the sources.</blockquote></p>
<p>It seems LG Display has been experiencing <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/03/12/ipad-2-lcd-light-bleeding/">some light leakage problem with the 9.7-inch IPS LCD</a> manufactured from its Gen 6 LCD fab. As a result Samsung overtook LGD as the #1 supplier of iPad panels in the first quarter of 2011, shipping four million units versus 3.2 million by LGD. LGD has reportedly fixed the light leakage problem and has resumed full production and shipment into the iPad program.</p>
