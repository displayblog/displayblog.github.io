<p>There are only a few 37" LCD TVs out there that can claim a 1920 x 1080 resolution. Sharp's LC-37D90U is one of them. With two HDMI inputs, Full HD or 1080p content can be pushed through, such as Blu-Ray or a Playstation 3. The 1080p content does not need to be scaled up or down resulting in clean video content. With LCD TVs that have only 1366 x 768 resolution, any HD content will need to be scaled, reducing picture quality.</p>

<p>The LC-37D90U has a 16:9 aspect ratio, sports a 1200:1 contrast ratio, but the brightness is limited to only 450 cd/m2. With the smaller 37" size, you'd want to be a bit closer, so the 450 cd/m2 might be enough, but I'd like to see something north of 500 cd/m2. But, 450 nits is good considering the additional amount of light 2+ million pixels absorb compared to just 1 million. The enclosure is a nice Titanium-like color and the speakers located on the bottom looks much nicer than those stuck to the side. The LCD is most likely Sharp's, and based on its Advanced Super View (ASV) technology, a proprietary technological improvement on the vertical alignment (VA) technology. Aside from HannStar, LG.Philips LCD (LPL) and Hitachi, all TFT LCD manufacturers are using one form of VA. The three mentioned here use a variation of In-Plane Switching (IPS) technology. Overall, I really like what Sharp has done with the LC-37D90U.</p>
