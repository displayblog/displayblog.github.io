<p>[ <a href="https://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/uscorp1/press-releases/2016-01-06-dell-updates-latitude-and-industry-leading-monitor">Dell</a> ] Finally, we are getting large OLED monitors. This OLED monitor from Dell is 30 inches and sports a pixel format of 3840x2160&nbsp;called Ultra HD or UHD or 4K or a combination of the three. Dell states a contrast ratio of 400,000:1, but that's because testing equipment can't register anything higher, according to <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/9923/dell-demonstrates-30inch-4k-oled-display">AnandTech</a>. Black on an OLED display has zero brightness; the ratio of something and zero is, I think, infinity. Here are some tech specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Video Connection: mini DisplayPort, HDMI, USB Type-C (power, video, and data)</li>
<li>Color Space: 100% AdobeRGB, 97.8% DCI-P3</li>
<li>Colors: 1.07 billion (10-bit)</li><br />
</ul><br />
OLED response times are an order of magnitude faster than LCD and in the case of this monitor it is 0.1 ms. Gamers as well as anyone who loves watching sports on their monitors&nbsp;should start saving up as soon as possible. This 30-inch 4K OLED monitor will be available on March 31 and, according to <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2016/01/06/dell-ultrasharp-30-latitude-12-7000-latitude-13-7000/">Engadget</a>,&nbsp;will set you back a cool US$5000.</p>
