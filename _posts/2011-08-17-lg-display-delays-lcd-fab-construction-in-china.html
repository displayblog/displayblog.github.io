<blockquote>
<p>LG Display (LGD) has canceled a ground breaking ceremony for construction of an 8.5G LCD panel plant in Guangzhou, China, scheduled for August 30, 2011, citing flat sales of large-area panels worldwide and oversupply concerns, according to a a media report.</p><br />

<p>It takes about one year from groundbreaking to pilot production. LGD's decision regarding the Gen 8.5 LCD fab tells me the company thinks demand for LCDs will continue to be weak for another year.</p></p>
