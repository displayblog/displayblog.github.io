<p><img src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Samsung_NX100_iFunction_NX_Mini_DSLR_Mirrorless_Engadget.jpg" alt="" title="Samsung_NX100_iFunction_NX_Mini_DSLR_Mirrorless_Engadget" width="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12709" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/24/samsung-nx100-preview/">Engadget</a> took the Samsung NX100 for a spin. Here are some choice findings in simple terms.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rigid and solid.</li>
<li>Easy to use button placements.</li>
<li>Fits well in your hand.</li>
<li>i-Function NX lens.</li>
<li>AMOLED display.</li>
<li>Price, just US$599 with a 20-50mm lens.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Not-so-pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heavy, so not as portable as you'd like.</li>
<li>No optical viewfinder.</li>
<li>No SDXC support.</li>
<li>Poor low-light capability, especially in automatic mode.</li>
<li>Jelly-vision in 720p HD video capture.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>If video is important the jelly-vision 720p on the NX100 isn't going to work for you. The 3.0-inch AMOLED with a 640x480 pixel format is as good as they come and it certainly is important when using the display as a viewfinder as is the case with the NX100: the better the display, the better the pictures look, and the better you feel.</p>
<p>The i-Function on the new NX lenses looks to be a unique solution to allow more control of camera settings, but <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/09/20/engadget-samsung-nx100/">as I have said before</a>, I feel it relies too much on the left hand.</p>
<p>What really topples the NX100 from being a top contender in this highly competitive mirrorless interchangeable lens compact digital camera market is the poor low-light performance especially in automatic mode. Here's hoping a future firmware update will fix that.</p>
