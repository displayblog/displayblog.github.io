<p><a href="http://www.zdnet.co.kr/news/news_view.asp?artice_id=20140419082032">ZDNet Korea</a>: The rumor is the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is coming in the second half of 2014 with Youm display technology. What is Youm? <a href="http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/news-events/press-releases/detail?newsId=12521">Youm is a flexible OLED display technology using plastic substrates</a>. Senior VP of OLED Research at Samsung Display Co. Brian Berkeley demonstrated a prototype three sided Youm display at CES in 2013 (<a href="http://youtu.be/Ix_-uRxIKNs">YouTube</a>: Pay particular attention from 1:35.). I'm sure some will take full advantage of having discrete access to information on the side of the smartphone, but I'm more excited about future smartphones becoming more rugged without becoming rugged looking. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2013/10/14/lg-g-flex/">The idea of an almost indestructible display sounds good to me</a>.</p>
