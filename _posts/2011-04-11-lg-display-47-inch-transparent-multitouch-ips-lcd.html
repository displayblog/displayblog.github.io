<blockquote><p>LG Display showcase a 47 inch Transparent LCD with multitouch functionality. This Transparent LCD Display has a full HD 1920x1080 pixel resolution. The Panel is an IPS technology with 10.000 K colour temperature. This display can be used for shopping malls and the digital signage market.</blockquote></p>
<p>I think the most powerful use of transparent displays is for augmented reality. For instance, a transparent LCD can be used to make an aquarium and show details of a particular fish, water temperature, ph balance, etc. A multitouch transparent desk with built-in image sensors at the pixel level could be quite promising, too. Make sure to hop on over to OLED-Display.net and watch the videos of LG Display's 47-inch multitouch transparent LCD doing its thing.</p>
