<p><a href="http://allthingsd.com/20110629/touchpad-needs-more-apps-reboot-to-rival-ipad/">Walt Mossberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve been testing the TouchPad for about a week and, in my view, despite its attractive and different user interface, this first version is simply no match for the iPad. It suffers from poor battery life, a paucity of apps and other deficits.</blockquote></p>
<p>Those other deficits: no rear camera, 300 tablet-optimized apps, Angry Birds crashed repeatedly requiring a hard reboot, Windows-like behavior where it grows sluggish the more you use it requiring a hard reboot, uneven Flash performance, lack of precision cursor placement, etc.</p>
<p>Mossberg's conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p>But, at least for now, I can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t recommend the TouchPad over the iPad 2.</blockquote></p>
