<blockquote><p>Page, however, seems to recognize that this project in some ways requires a different approach from the Google norm. One variation that users will notice comes in interface design &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; conspicuously, in Circles. With colorful animations, drag-and-drop magic and whimsical interface touches, Circles looks more like a classic Apple program than the typically bland Google app. That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s no surprise since the key interface designer was legendary software artist Andy Herzfeld.</blockquote></p>
<p>Herzfeld is the design lead of the team Emerald Sea, code name for Google+. Check out the <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/introducing-google-project-real-life.html">introductory videos for Google+</a>. They are very well done.</p>
