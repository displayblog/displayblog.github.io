<p>Innolux Display, a Taiwan-based manufacturer of LCDs, is planning to mass produce 22" wide LCD monitor panels later this month. Innolux is currently developing a 26" wide LCD monitor panel and plans to mass produce it in early 2007.</p>
<p>Remember one of the first 22" LCD monitors? I believe it was Apple that came out with a 22", but the resolution was much less than what we have now at 1680 x 1050. I'm not sure why the resurgence of 22", but it must have something to do with how G6 and G7 LCD fabs are optimized. I personally do not like the 22" size and resolution as it does not give me any additional pixel real estate than a 20" but costs more. Same deal with 26": I'd stick with yesterday's 23" at the same resolution of 1920 x 1200.</p>
