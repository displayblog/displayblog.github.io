<p>Advantech's eAutomation Group introduced the IPPC-9171G industrial Panel PC on September 6, 2006. The IPPC-9171G features a 2.8GHz Pentium 4 or 2.5GHz Celeron CPU, 4GB of DDR400 RAM, and a 17" 1280 x 1024 (SXGA) TFT LCD all packed into a single enclosure. Add to that two PCI slots and an USB connector on the front.</p>

<p>The enclosure is made with heavy-duty stainless steel with an aluminum front panel. The glass that covers the LCD is also strengthened by anodic coating to withstand damage from shocks, prevent panel abrasion and acid corrosion. The IPPC-9171G will start at $2100.</p>
<p>This would be a perfect addition to my home! Kids can be ruthless with computers and something like the IPPC-9171G that can take a few beatings would be great.</p>
