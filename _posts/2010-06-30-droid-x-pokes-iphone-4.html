Here's the poke by Droid X:</p>
<blockquote><p>Introducing the DROID X by MOTOROLA, the ultimate smart phone. Its screen is gigantic. Its capacity is huge. Every experience from messaging to movies is larger than life. It can even connect with your HD TV so you can share little things with large audiences. And most importantly, it comes with a double antenna design. The kind that allows you to hold the phone any way you like and use it just about anywhere to make crystal clear calls. <strong>You have a voice. And you deserve to be heard.</strong></blockquote><br />
Apple, your turn.</p>
