<p>The LG G Flex sports a 6-inch flexible OLED display, probably <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2013/10/08/lg-display-mass-produces-worlds-first-flexible-oled-panel-for-smartphones/">the flexible OLED display LG Display announced not many days ago</a> using a plastic substrate and film-type encapsulation technology. Unlike the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2013/10/09/samsung-galaxy-round/">Samsung Galaxy Round</a>, the LG G Flex&mdash;if the sexy render above is accurate&mdash;is curved the right way. The curvature would fit a person's face better with the speaker near the ear and the mic near the mouth. It would also fit in back pockets since most human beings have curved buttocks. And if you happen to sit on it, with the G Flex in your back pocket, it wouldn't matter since the flexible OLED display is unbreakable according to LG Display. Though I wonder if the rest of the G Flex will be as tough.</p>
<p><em>Update 2013.10.28:</em> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/27/5036288/lg-g-flex-officially-announced">The LG G Flex is official</a>. According to LG the flexed 6-inch 720p display is brighter and more precise thanks to its "Real RGB" sub-pixel format.</p>
<p><em>Update 2013.11.04:</em> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/5/5067186/lg-g-flex-curved-oled-smartphone-hands-on">Sam Byford, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>While LG says the curvature of the screen makes viewing movies more "immersive," the size is likely to play a far stronger role in achieving that goal. In general use, we didn't find that the curve made much of a positive or negative impact either way.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2013/10/29/samsung-galaxy-round-not-just-marketing-gimmick/">Raymond Soneira concluded the curvature of the Samsung Galaxy Round significantly reduces reflection interferences and improves the overall visual experience</a>. If the display curvature is the reason, we can expect similar improvements on the LG G Flex. But it's interesting Byford wasn't able to detect any positive impact. We'll just have to wait until Soneira tests a G Flex to know for sure.</p>
<p><em>Update 2013.11.19:</em> <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/smartphones/lg-g-flex/4505-6452_7-35831141.html">Scott Stein and Lynn La took the LG G Flex for a spin, c|net</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The curve&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not immense: it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s more like a continuous, gentle bend. It actually seemed to make the otherwise immense 6-inch OLED display a little easier to manage: the thin, curving form served to minimize the extra-wide flatness that normally would follow a phone this size. It hugs the face nicely [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>From the photos c|net posted up the 6-inch OLED display seems to be flexed just a tiny bit, which looks a lot less than the glamour shot showing at the top of this post.</p>
<blockquote><p>The curve also worked particularly well for videos: the HD display has a 1,280x720-pixel resolution and seemed particularly clear and glare-free, which matches what CNET TV editor David Katzmaier says holds true for larger curved-display OLED televisions.</blockquote></p>
<p>I don't think this type of curve would work very well on smaller smartphones, but with the 6-inch 16:9 OLED display the curve seems to have enhanced the experience of viewing videos by making it more immersive. Glare or more accurately refocusing on the object that is being reflected can take you out of an immersive experience. Any smartphone brand targeting users who watch a lot of videos will need to take note of this: glare-free.</p>
