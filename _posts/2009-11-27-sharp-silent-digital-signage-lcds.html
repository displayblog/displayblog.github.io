<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=sharp&amp;sa=Search#1348">Sharp</a> announced a line of LCDs geared for digital signage applications that are silent: 42-inch PN-E421, 47-inch PN-E471, 52-inch PN-E521, 60-inch PN-E601. The PN-E601 and PN-E521 make use of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/09/17/sharp-uv2a-technology/">Sharp's UV2A LCD technology</a> allowing for solid picture quality while consuming less power than comparably-sized LCDs. Unlike most other digital signage LCDs, all four from Sharp incorporate fanless designs making them completely silent. Sharp has figured a way to dissipate all that heat without the use of noisy fans that ultimately fail. As with proper digital signage displays, these silent LCDs from Sharp are 24/7 capable.
