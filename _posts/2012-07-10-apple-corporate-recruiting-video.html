<p><a href="http://youtu.be/A7HVt3xgTn4">YouTube</a>: Worth a watch, but I'm wondering why Apple thought there was a need for a video like this. My guess? Anyone who knows someone who is currently working at Apple has heard it's an excruciatingly challenging place to work. Forget friends, forget family, you'd better be <em>all in</em> at Apple or you'll soon be gone. That's probably why.</p>
