<p>It seems Samsung can't get enough 40" LCD TV panels from its joint venture S-LCD with Sony and its new, and second, G7 plant located in Tangjeong, South Korea. Although the new G7 plant has been operational only about 3 months, so capacity is probably being limited with normal ramp issues such as yields.</p>
<p>Samsung has tapped AUO as a supplier of 40" LCD TV panels. This news is interesting because AUO's fab is optimized for 42" sizes, not 40". AUO will be throwing away a lot of glass making 40". Of course, throwing away a bit more glass is much better than making 42" panels and storing them in inventory because there aren't any customers. Of course, that could change as I have seen very aggressively priced 42" LCD TVs here in the US going for <a href="http://www.costco.com/Browse/Product.aspx?Prodid=11118301&amp;whse=BC&amp;topnav=&amp;browse=">$1800</a>. AUO has begun pilot production of 40" panels and will enter mass production of 40" in the fourth quarter of this year.</p>

<p>It will be great for us as 40" and 42" continue to beat each other up and prices come down. I'm looking forward to a Full HD 42" LCD TV with LED backlights going for $999 soon by fourth quarter of 2007. I can't wait!</p>
