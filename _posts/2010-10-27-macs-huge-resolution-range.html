<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/10/27/display-resolution">Daring Fireball</a>, <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2010/10/new-macs&acirc;&euro;&trade;-resolutions/">Dr. Drang</a> on Mac resolutions:</p>
<blockquote><p>When the Mac first came out, one of its great WYSIWYG features was that a pixel on the screen was supposed to be equal in size to a printer&acirc;&euro;&trade;s point: 1/72&acirc;&euro;&sup3;.</blockquote></p>
<p>Not now:</p>
<blockquote><p>On a 11&acirc;&euro;&sup3; MacBook Air, a 72-pixel line&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;which would measure 1 inch long against an onscreen ruler&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;is just 0.53 physical inches long. On a 21.5&acirc;&euro;&sup3; iMac, that same line is 0.70 inches long. User interface items, like buttons, menu items, and scroll bars are 30% bigger on the iMac than on the Air.</blockquote></p>
<p>Aside from the newly introduced MacBook Airs and the 17-inch MacBook Pro, most Macs have a resolution that is within a tight range of 109 to 113 PPI.</p>
<p>The resolution on new Macs seem to be converging around 130 PPI. The 11.6-inch MacBook Air has a range-topping 135 PPI while the larger 13.3-inch version has 128 PPI. The 17-inch MacBook Pro has 133 PPI. If you consider the 1680x1050 option on the 15-inch MacBook Pro the resolution increases from 110 to almost 129 PPI.</p>
<p>Next generation MacBook and Pros will most likely change:</p>
<ul>
<li>13.3: 1280x800 to 1440x900</li>
<li>15.4: 1440x900 to 1680x1050 standard</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>That leaves the iMacs. If the 21.5-inch iMac goes from 1920x1080 to 2560x1440 the resolution increases from 102 to 137 PPI. The 27-inch iMac will need to increase to 2880x1800 (double 1440x900) to get to 126 PPI.</p>
<p>Although not exactly the same a tight range around 130 PPI for all Macs will make the overall experience similar.</p>
<p>The original Macintosh had a 9-inch monochrome CRT display and had a pixel format of 512x342. That's about 68 PPI. Interestingly that's also about half of what the new Macbooks are converging toward. So maybe the new Macs' great WYSIWYG feature will be that 2x2 pixels on the screen will be equal to size to a printer's point: 1/72".</p>
