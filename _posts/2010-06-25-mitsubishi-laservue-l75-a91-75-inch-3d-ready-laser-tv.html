<p>Mitsubishi is enlarging its LaserVue line. LaserVue is unique in that it uses lasers as the light source. The LaserVue L75-A91 is a 75-inch behemoth, measures 66.4x41.7x15 inches (WxHxD), weighs 154 pounds, and sports a 1920x1080 pixel format. Resolution is a bottom-scrapping 29.4 PPI. I would have expected a Quad HD (3840 x 2160) pixel format for a mediocre resolution of 58.7 PPI. There is a first-ever Cinema Color mode and StreamTV Internet media.</p>
<p>The L75-A91 consumes just 128 watts and exceeds the new Energy Star qualifications by 50%. It is old but in <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/05/12/power-consumption-lcd-vs-plasma/">Power Consumption: LCD vs. Plasma</a></em> I noted a Sony 46-inch 1080p LCD TV consuming 269 watts. You can see that Mitsubishi's 75-inch LaserVue completely demolishes it. Like I said that was a while back so I decided to look through Sony's newest 3D LCD TV models and came up with the biggest and baddest: the 60-inch BRAVIA LX900 Series 3D HDTV. It sports a 60-inch LCD with an edge-lit LED backlight and a 1920x1080 pixel format. And it consumes 228 watts when in operation, much better than last year, but still quite a ways from the 75-inch LaserVue.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include four HDMI-CEC inputs. L75-A91 is 3D-ready. The optional 3D Starter Kit (3DC-1000) includes two pairs of active shutter 3D glasses, a 3D emitter, 3D adapter with remote, an HDMI cable and a sample Disney 3D Blu-ray disk; it will be available in July. The L75-A91 has a MSRP of $5,999. Steep yes, but the smaller 60-inch from Sony isn't cheap either at a penny less than $5000.</p>
