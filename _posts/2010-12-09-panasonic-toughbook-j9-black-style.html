<blockquote><p>The screen is really crisp and bright, with a very high resolution (1366&Atilde;&mdash;768) for such a 10.1&acirc;&euro;¬ù display. When browsing, I sometimes found fonts too small to read comfortably, but this is really a matter of taste, and the extra high image quality more than makes up for it.</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple's new 11.6-inch MacBook Air has a pixel format of 1366x768. This smallest of MacBooks has the highest resolution with 135PPI (read: <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/10/27/macs-huge-resolution-range/">Macs: Huge Resolution Range</a>). The 10.1-inch LCD on the Panasonic Toughbook J9 Black Style beats it with 155PPI. But high resolution can be wasted.</p>
<p>High resolution is like a double-edged sword: when the UI takes full advantage of it things look wonderful. The difference between an iPhone 3GS and the iPhone 4 is remarkable: text and graphics are sharper.</p>
<p>Windows squanders the extra resolution and instead of making things sharper they get smaller. The Toughbook J9 suffers from Windows' inability to take advantage of the high-end display. The only real benefit of high resolution displays on a Windows machine is when you're working on visual stuff like images and photographs. OS X is guilty of wasting resolution, too.
