<blockquote>
<p>While stacking chips vertically enhances the functionality of semiconductors used in mobile terminals, the thickness of individual chips must be reduced to enable such a vertical structure. These thin semiconductor chips are produced by supporting silicon wafers on a glass substrate called a back-grinding substrate (BG substrate) and grinding them to reduce their thickness to about 50 &Icirc;&frac14;m.
