<p>Matrox is giving notebook PC users the ability to have two external displays running with its DualHead2Go Digital Edition box that connects to the VGA port. The DualHead2Go Digital Edition can support two displays with 1920 x 1200 pixels each for a total of 3840 x 1200 pixels of digital real estate! The notebook PC's OS detects the DualHead2Go Digital Edition as an ultra-widescreen monitor which is then split into two or more standard resolutions compatible with the attached displays. I can attest to the increase in productivity when using more than a single monitor as I do not need to constantly Alt-Tab or maximize/minimize windows. Matrox states that the DualHead2Go Digital Edition is compatible with both Windows-based PCs and Macs.
