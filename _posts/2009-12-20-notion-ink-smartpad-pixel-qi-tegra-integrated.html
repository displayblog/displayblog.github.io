<p><a href="http://www.slashgear.com/notion-ink-tegra-android-smartpad-uses-pixel-qi-display-1866308/">Slash Gear</a>: The Notion Ink Smartpad is something else: WiFi, Bluetooth, UMTS/HSDPA, A-GPS, USB, HDMI, 3.5mm headphone jack, microphone jack, accelerometer, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor, water sensor, 3-megapixel autofocus video-recording geotagging webcam, 16GB/32GB flash storage, SD card slot, 48-hour battery, 8-hour HD video playback, 16-hour WiFi-based web surfing, Android, capable of running three simultaneous 1080p streams.</p>
<p>Impressive, thanks to NVIDIA's TEGRA system on chip solution. But what excites me most is Pixel Qi's 10.1-inch TFT LCD that sports a 1024x600 pixel format. The Pixel Qi LCD is unique in that it can truly be used as both a regular full-color fast-response display as well as one that bests E Ink-based ebook reader displays by consuming very little power but able turn to the next page instantly and replay video. The LCD also sports an anti-glare coat that should help when using the Smartpad outside. I'm so glad that glare is going out the door. Since you'll be using your finger the fine folks at Notion Ink working with Pixel Qi decided to make the display scratch-resistant and fingerprint-resistant using a oleophobic coating.</p>
