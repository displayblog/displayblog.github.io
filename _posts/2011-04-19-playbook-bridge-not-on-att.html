<blockquote><p>The only way to access e-mail, calendar and contact information on the BlackBerry PlayBook without using a browser is via an app called BlackBerry Bridge, which links Research in Motion&acirc;&euro;&trade;s tablet to BlackBerry smartphones.</p>
<p>Too bad that AT&T subscribers can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t use it yet.</blockquote></p>
<p>The PlayBook doesn't come with native email or browsing capability. You get that from your BlackBerry smartphone using the Bridge app. But not if you're a BlackBerry user on AT&T.</p>
