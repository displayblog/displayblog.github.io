<p>If you think about the T260HD fills in a nice gap. Which gap? If you were looking to purchase a 1080p-capable <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a>, you would need to get at least a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=32">32"</a> LCD TV (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/06/09/sony-kdl-32xbr6-32-lcd-tv/">Sony's KDL-32XBR6</a>, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/05/23/samsung-ln32a650-32-lcd-tv/">Samsung's LN32A650</a>, etc.). The price? Probably more than you would want to pay. With the T260HD, you get a 1080p-capable LCD TV at just 26" and at a good price, about $600.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dynamic-contrast">dynamic contrast</a> ratio of 10,000:1 isn't too bad, but hopefully the static contrast ratio is good too. In terms of connectivity, there are two HDMI ports, a DVI port and a VGA port. Pretty much all you need to hook up any signal and as many as you want. The 26" size is near a perfect size to be used as a gigantic LCD monitor and a decent sized LCD TV. It seems the T260HD is available in three Touch of Colors: Blue, Red and Green.</p>
<p>The only thing that you need to be aware of before rushing out to get one these multifunction LCD monitors is that the LCD panel is of the TN variety. What is that to you? The viewing angle is limited so it would be best to watch movies by youself.</p>
