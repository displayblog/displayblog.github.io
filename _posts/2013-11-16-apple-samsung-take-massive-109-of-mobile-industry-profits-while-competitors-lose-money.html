<p><a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/11/14/apple-samsung-take-massive-109-of-mobile-industry-profits-while-competitors-lose-money">Neil Hughes, AppleInsider</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The mobile market continues to be a two-horse race for profitability between Apple and Samsung, with the two rivals commanding 109 percent of profits &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; a number made possible because its competitors are actually losing money in the smartphone space.</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple took 56% and Samsung took 53% for a total of 109%. To me anything more than 100% doesn't make one bit of sense. The error by Canaccord Genuity: losses are counted as <em>extra</em> profits. Nonetheless, Apple and Samsung are the current runaway winners, by far.</p>
