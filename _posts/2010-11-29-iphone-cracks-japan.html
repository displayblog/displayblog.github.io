<p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101126/ap_on_hi_te/as_tec_japan_iphone_apps">Yahoo! News</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Foreign developers of applications for phones didn't give the Japanese market a second thought because of its insularity. But that is changing as the iPhone, for which tens of thousands of applications have been created, dominates Japanese smartphone sales.</blockquote></p>
<p>How many iPhones are sold in Japan?</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple doesn't give iPhone sales breakdowns by country. But Japan makes up a significant chunk of the 70 million iPhones sold worldwide so far, including a record 14.1 million last quarter.</blockquote></p>
<p>That sounds incredibly high. Nonetheless Japan is and will continue to be an important market for Apple.</p>
