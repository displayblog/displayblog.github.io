<p>According to mobilephonehelpdesk, T-Mobile announced the T-Mobile MDA Vario IV (HTC Raphael) on May 28, 2008 in Germany. I have had the experience of using AT&T's Tilt, which is a full-fledged <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=smartphone">smartphone</a> with all the bells and whistles. The QWERTY keyboard on the Raphael seems to be very similar to the one on the Tilt. I am not a big fan of that keyboard because the keys respond differently to the same pressure. You have to push certain keys harder than others. I hope they fixed this problem on the Raphael. I like the flush design of the front where the screen and the controls are flat. The touch buttons on the bottom looks to be using Synaptic's technology.</p>
<p>The Raphael will, theoretically, allow for 7.2Mbps downloads via HSDPA. Where I live (San Jose, CA) the speeds will be much much lower than that. I've tested "3G" networks from Verizon Wireless (EV-DO) and AT&T (HSDPA) and the best download speeds I've been able to experience were about 1.2Mbps, and in bursts. Regular throughput were limited to about 250Kbps. I had to return both, unfortunately, since $60/mo for that level of performance is too rich for my blood. The good news is that AT&T is building out its 3G network nationwide and maybe that will kick things up a notch.</p>
<p>Raphael's LCD sporting <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=640-x-480">640 x 480</a> (landscape) is going to be really good. The specifications don't mention a screen size, but it probably isn't going to be bigger than 3". Even at 3" in size a 640 x 480 pixel format is great. I hope the UI doesn't disappoint.</p>

Raphael aka Touch Pro. HTC seems to have another winner here. The slide-out keyboard featured Touch Pro sports really fast 3G (7.2Mbps HSDPA) capability and the 2.8" 640 x 480 TFT LCD is going to be fantastic! I mentioned this above but that's 2x the number of pixels on the iPhone. And the iPhone-beating 3.2MP camera should grab some decent pictures and video.</p>
