<blockquote><p>If you wanted me to bet, I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d wager that Chrome OS is not going to succeed. I think Android is Google&acirc;&euro;&trade;s best mobile OS &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; it ought to be able to do everything Chrome does because it contains a great WebKit implementation, plus it has a native app layer that already has developer momentum.</blockquote></p>
<p>Niche, possibly. Success, maybe, maybe not.</p>
