<blockquote><p>Hewlett-Packard has killed off its much ballyhooed Windows 7 tablet computer, says a source who's been briefed on the matter.</blockquote></p>
<p>The reason? HP isn't satisfied with Windows 7 as a tablet OS. I wonder if Palm's webOS has anything to do with it. HP may also be planning to ditch Intel CPUs as well due to their power-hungry nature. Will there be a bidding war for ARM?</p>
