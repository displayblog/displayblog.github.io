<p><a href="http://www.dpreview.com/previews/sony-dsc-rx100">DPReview</a>: 20MP 1-inch Exmor CMOS image sensor, 3-inch WhiteMagic 640&times;RGBW&times;480 LCD, 1080/60p MP4, 10fps continuous shooting, US$650.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.06.28:</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/28/technology/personaltech/a-pocket-camera-even-pro-photographers-can-love-state-of-the-art.html?pagewanted=1&%2359&_r=3&%2359;pagewanted=all">David Pogue</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is a review of the best pocket camera ever made.</blockquote></p>
<p><em>Update 2012.07.27:</em> Low light performance is one of the most important metrics for me. So I was glad to see the RX100 is no slouch here. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/27/3187725/sony-rx100-review">Sam Byford, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>ISO performance is particularly impressive given the 20-megapixel sensor, and the Zeiss lens manages to keep up admirably. When it comes to low-light performance there's simply no competition from any other camera this size.</blockquote></p>
<p>I will wait for DPReview's full review to be absolutely sure, but the RX100 at the moment is the point-and-shoot to get:</p>
<blockquote><p>It's really no exaggeration to say that it produces images roughly on par with an average DSLR and kit lens combination, making this a revolutionary camera that means you'll always be in a situation where you can take genuinely high quality pictures.</blockquote></p>
<p><em>Update 2012.09.27:</em> <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/sony-cybershot-dsc-rx100/15">DPReview's full review of the RX100</a> is out:</p>
<blockquote><p>The RX100 is probably the most capable compact camera on the market today, combining the image quality benefits of a mid-sized sensor with the proportions of a conventional compact. Extensive, though not flawless, manual controls make the RX100 a great second camera for DSLR shooters.</blockquote></p>
<p>I'd say the RX100 makes a great first and only camera for a lot of folks.</p>
