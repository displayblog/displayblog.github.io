<p>LG's domestic brand for NBPCs is Xnote. Before, a while back actually, they partnered with IBM and basically rebadged the ThinkPads to LG IBM, made the keyboards Korean and loaded up a Korean-language Windows OS. Not any more. LG has been making Xnotes really neat lately. Take for instance the T1. This is a 14" widescreen with 1440*900 pixel format, which is a bit more than your usual 1280*800 that you get at that size. Other specifics include:</p>
<p>CPU: Intel Core Duo L2400 running at 1.66GHz with a 667MHz FSB<br />
RAM: 1GB DDR2 667 (512MB*2)<br />
HDD: 60GB<br />
GPU: Intel GMA950 w/256MB (Max)<br />
WiFi: 802.11a/b/g<br />
Ports: USB 2.0 (3), S-Video, FireWire, VGA, SPDIF</p>
