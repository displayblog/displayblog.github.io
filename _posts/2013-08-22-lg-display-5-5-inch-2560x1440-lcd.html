<p><a href="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/3089017/_Press_Release_LG_Display_Develops_World%E2%80%99s_First_Quad_HD_LCD_Panel_for_Smartphones.pdf">LG (PDF)</a>: LG Display announced a 5.5-inch LCD with a pixel format of 2560x1440 good for an impressive resolution of 538 ppi. And it's only 1.21-mm thick.</p>
<p>When Steve Jobs introduced the 3.5-inch <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/09/retina-display/">retina display</a> on the iPhone 4 most of us understood the limit of our visual acuity to be around 300 ppi at a distance of about 12 inches. Anything much more than that was unnecessary. DisplayMate Technologies president <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina_Display">Raymond Soneira believes it to be closer to 477 ppi</a>. But 538 ppi is beyond even Soneira's number. Necessary? Probably not. Incredible? Absolutely.</p>
