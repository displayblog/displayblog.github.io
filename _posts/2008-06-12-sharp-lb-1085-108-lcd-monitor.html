<p>You need big? <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sharp">Sharp</a> has got you covered. Sharp's LB-1085 is a 108" <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-monitor">LCD monitor</a>! Sharp is targeting the 108" monster for commercial applications, but I don't see why it wouldn't work in your massive living room. Unfortunately, or fortunately, the pixel format is limited to <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a>. You won't be able to watch more than a single 1080p HD stream, but that might be all you want. You can also consider tiling four together to get to <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/05/18/samsung-82-quadhd-120hz-lcd/">Quad Full HD</a> configuration. </p>
<p>When used for its intended market, we can look forward to massive advertisements at super exclusive retail outlets in the near future. Or actually, at the Shinjuku Piccadilly, Tokyo's premiere multiplex cinema. The LB-1085 will be set up in the center of the third floor main lobby facing the open foyer.</p>

<p>The LB-1085's LCD panel is manufactured from Sharp's Kameyama Plant No. 2 and 108" is the maximum size that can be manufactured from a single 8th generation (G8) glass substrate with a dimension of 2160 x 2460mm.</p>
