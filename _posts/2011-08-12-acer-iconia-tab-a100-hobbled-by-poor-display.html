<p>Dana Wollman, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/08/12/acer-iconia-tab-a100-review/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The 7-inch (1024 x 600) display has something of a split personality as far as viewing angles go. On the one hand, you won't miss any detail if you're sharing the tablet with a friend and happen to be watching a YouTube clip from an awkward side angle. [&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;] On the other hand, trying to watch something with the tablet set down on a table in front of you is an exercise in futility. Forget a washed-out spot here or some color distortion there -- what you'll see is contrast so severe that you'll think you're looking at an inverse of whatever it is you were watching.</blockquote></p>
<p>It should be obvious to anyone who has used a tablet: we use it in both portrait and in landscape modes. So viewing angles should be good in either orientation. No matter what price points a brand wants to hit, with a tablet cut costs everywhere but the display. The display makes the tablet, and breaks it too. Unfortunately, Acer made a poor decision with its Iconia Tab A100 by using a poor display.</p>
