<p>Global Mixed-mode Technology (GMT) and AU Optronics (AUO) have formed a joint venture to develop LED and analog driver ICs. Raydium Semiconductor's analog IC production assets maybe transfered to the new joint venture. AUO will invest NT$20M while GMT will put in NT$10M. GMT's competitors including Advanced Analog Technology (AAT) and Richtek Technology will likely see declining future sales into AUO.
