<p>David Streitfeld, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/technology/amazon-struggling-fire-phone.html">The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But at three Bay Area AT&T stores over the weekend, salesmen said that the Fire had performed dismally. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;We got special shirts, staffed up for the launch &mdash; and then nothing,&acirc;&euro; said one salesman, who estimated his store had sold a total of 10 Fire phones. At a smaller store, two salesmen said they had sold exactly one Fire.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;We had modest expectations, and the phone seems to be shy of those,&acirc;&euro; said Gene Munster, a senior analyst at Piper Jaffray. But the price cut and an aggressive ad campaign will make a difference. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;The Fire was searching for a feature and just found it: a low price,&acirc;&euro; he said.</blockquote></p>
