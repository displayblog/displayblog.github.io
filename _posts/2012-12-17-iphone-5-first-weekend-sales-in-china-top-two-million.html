<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/12/16iPhone-5-First-Weekend-Sales-in-China-Top-Two-Million.html">Apple</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple today announced it has sold over two million of its new iPhone 5 in China, just three days after its launch on December 14.</blockquote></p>
<p>Horace Dediu, <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2012/12/17/calibrating-launch-performance-for-the-iphone-in-china/">Asymco</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/12/17/apple-iphone-5-china-analysts/">According to ISI&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Brian Marshall</a>, the iPhone achieved 1.5% penetration of the 3G subscriber base or 15 iPhones per 1000 3G subscribers. If we assumed the same basis (3G subs) that would make the iPhone 5 twice as popular on launch in China than in the US.</blockquote></p>
<p>Does this indicate China will soon become the largest market for iPhones?</p>
