<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/8528810/HP-Touchpad-will-be-better-than-number-one-tablet.html">Eric Cador</a>, HP's European head:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the PC world, with fewer ways of differentiating HP&acirc;&euro;&trade;s products from our competitors, we became number one; in the tablet world we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re going to become better than number one. We call it number one plus.</blockquote></p>
<p>Better than number one?</p>
<p>The strategy by which you become the largest supplier of PCs today is simple: build everything from the cheapest to the most expensive and serve every market. You don't need differentiation, you need size.</p>
<p>At the end of the day shipment market share counts for very little. Profits do.</p>
<p>Number One Plus? <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2011/05/23/always-optimistic-hp-says-touchpad-will-be-better-than-number-one/">CrunchGear</a> reader haromaster:</p>
<blockquote><p>It will be better than no. 1, it will be Zero</blockquote></p>
<p>Without a shipping product the TouchPad is currently at zero.</p>
