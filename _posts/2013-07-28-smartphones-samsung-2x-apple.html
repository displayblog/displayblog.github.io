<blockquote><p>Samsung, on the heels of its Galaxy S4 launch during the quarter, saw its volumes reach new levels and accounted for nearly a third of the entire smartphone market. Not to be overlooked is the continued success of its Galaxy S III smartphones, which saw renewed interest following discounted prices in advance of the Galaxy S4 launch. By the end of the quarter, Samsung more than doubled the total volumes of the next largest vendor, and shipped more units than the next four vendors combined.</blockquote></p>
<p>Samsung's smartphone shipment unit share in Q2'13 was 30.4%. The next largest vendor? Apple, with 13.1% share. This is a big win for Samsung no doubt, but I'm more interested in <em>profit</em> share.</p>
