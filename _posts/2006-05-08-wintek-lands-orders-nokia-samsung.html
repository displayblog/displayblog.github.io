<p>Nokia is the world&#39;s largest supplier of mobile phones. Samsung is number two. So landing orders for these two gorillas is a great triumpth for Wintek. Wintek specializes in CSTN LCD panels for small-medium applications. CSTN is substantially cheaper than TFT LCDs and is generally used in mobile phones sub-displays. The top-end mobile phones are all shifting toward using TFT LCDs in their main- and sub-displays but the majority of the ~750 million phones that will be sold globally in 2006 will have CSTN due to lower costs. I am willing to bet that Nokia and Samsung mobile phones with Wintek LCDs will primarily go toward consumers in China and India, the two largest markets for mobile phones with more than 1 billion in population each.</p>
