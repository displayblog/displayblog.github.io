<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/12/06/johns-phone-review-the-worlds-simplest-cellphone/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>So is the John's Phone "The world's simplest cellphone." No. The fact that all three of the device's switches are so frustrating to use is simply unforgivable on such a basic cellphone that's supposedly rooted in "great design."</blockquote></p>
<p>Simple, but not really. &acirc;&sbquo;&not;70-&acirc;&sbquo;&not;100 depending on the model. Not worth it. My backup is an old-school RAZR: simple <em>and</em> cheap.</p>
