<p>I don't know if this is in fact true or not but I believe made in Japan stands for quality. I have had very good experiences with electronics that were made in Japan. They cost me a bit more but it was worth it because they stood the test of time. I still have my original <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sony">Sony</a> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=walkman">Walkman</a> that works. Well, just the radio. It's amazing that even the radio still works given that my dad was forced to give it to me back in 1985! If that Walkman was made in... Tanzania for instance, my guess is that the radio would have failed a long time ago. Just a guess.</p>
<p>Do I want to pay the same price for a Toshiba LCD TV that's made in Taiwan? (Are they all made in Taiwan already?) If it was dirt cheap. Would I pay more for a Toshiba LCD TV that's made in Japan? I think I would, but not too much. What I am trying to say is this: keep some manufacturing local because some consumers might actually want that.</p>
