<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-11442 aligncenter" title="Viliv_N5_Ultra_Mini_Mobile_PC" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Viliv_N5_Ultra_Mini_Mobile_PC.jpg" alt="" width="512"   /></p><br />
Viliv is a Korean manufacturer of tiny mobile PCs, like the N5. &Acirc;&nbsp;Viliv calls the N5 an ultra mini mobile PC; it is mobile, it is quite small (172x86x25 mm, 6.77x3.38x0.98 inch), weighs just 388g (0.85 pounds), and it really is a PC; the little thing runs Windows 7.</p>
<p>Matt Burns at <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/06/26/first-impressions-viliv-n5-ultra-mini-mobile-pc/">TechCrunch</a> took it for a spin:</p>
<blockquote><p>The WSVGA 1024x600 screen is gorgeous. It's sharp, bright, and displays adequate contrast. It might be the most impressive feature of the N5.</blockquote><br />
The 4.8-inch LED-backlit LCD sports a 1024x600 pixel format resulting in a resolution of 247.26 PPI. The LCD is sharp, bright, has decent contrast, but very glossy. Most companies don't do touch very well since it is difficult to perfect. The single-touch performance on the preproduction N5 is reportedly finicky; not quite accurate.&Acirc;&nbsp;The 1.3GHz Intel Atom Z520 and GMA 500 graphics duo are powering the N5 and the little thing runs Hulu well enough with only a little lag. That's a very good thing. The little optical mouse is loved by some and loathed by others.</p>
<p>The N5 comes with 1GB DDR2 533MHz SDRAM, 32GB SSD, microSD, 3.5-mm headphone, mic-in, USB 2.0, 1.3 megapixel webcam, stereo speakers. Connectivity options include Bluetooth 2.0+EDR, WiFi BG, optional 3G (HSPA) and GPS Sirf Star3. The N5 is rated to last 6 hours with an standby time of 150 hours.
