<p>I remember back when Windows 3.1 just came out. I was in high school and working on Windows 3.0--simply a GUI on top of DOS. Windows 3.0 was simply terrible and slowed everything down, kind of like Vista. I had to get Windows 3.1 so I together with a couple of my geeky friends, split the cost three ways and purchased Windows 3.1 from Egghead. I was happy with Windows 3.1: it was much faster, the graphics was cooler and all was good in Saratoga. Fast forward about 20 years.</p>
<p>Windows 7 is Microsoft's fix to Vista. Vista is like Windows 3.0: it slows machines and makes the whole experience of using a computer less exciting. You feel like you're getting less work done and more work trying to fix the PC to make it work better with Vista. At least that's what I did for about six months. After failing I went back to Windows XP Pro SP3. Now Windows 7 is out and reviews are saying that it is much faster than Vista. That's great. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/08/12/windows-7-review/">Engadget just posted up a review of Windows 7 RTM</a> (Release To Manufacturing). The UI looks quite pretty (thanks to the interesting backgrounds they used) and there really are some great features: quick display switching, Aero snap and shake, etc. But what got me completely discouraged was this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our worst experiences, however, were with a clean install to a quite modern netbook. The OS became increasingly unstable over time -- Windows Explorer itself seemed to be the main culprit -- and the machine eventually failed to boot entirely. Luckily, the Startup Repair utility managed to jump to the rescue and found a System Restore point that booted fine, though we lost the few customizations we'd made up to that point and were face with basically a fresh install again. It was nice of Windows 7 to recover itself so well, but we would obviously have preferred to not run into that issue in the first place.</blockquote></p>
<p>That means Windows 7 is still Windows where after a long time of using it the system slowly gets worse and worse. Remember after I ditched Vista I went back to XP. And soon after going back to XP I went full blown over to OS X. I want to say that I've never looked back but I did. I tried to use Office 2008 on the Mac and I must say that the Mac Business Unit at Microsoft really don't know what they are doing: Excel for Mac really sucks guys. So I installed XP on top of Parallels to run Excel. You would think it would be slower, but it is actually faster, much faster, than running the Mac version of Excel.</p>
<p>Back to Windows 7: it's faster and prettier than Vista and has several snazzy features. But it's the old Windows that eventually die on you. The Mac mini that we have has been running without a cold reboot for months without showing any signs that it is slowing down and about to crawl to a halt. I've heard from a friend of mine that there is a guy who has a full-time job at Dell and his main responsibility is to go around all the Windows Servers and hard reboot them after a set number of hours. Truth or fiction, I don't know.</p>
