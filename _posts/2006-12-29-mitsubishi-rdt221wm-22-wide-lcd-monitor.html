<p>Mitsubishi's RDT221WM is a 22" wide LCD monitor in black or white. The pixel format is 1680 x 1050, which is standard on the new crop of 22" LCD monitors, has a 160-degree viewing angle (quite low, if you ask me), 300 cd/m2 of brightness and a 800:1 contrast ratio. The response time is 5ms. The RDT221WM touts 1W speakers (why bother?) with DVI-D (non-HDCP) and VGA inputs. The price is $506 and will be available on January 26.</p>

<p>The 1W speakers should be an option because that would be something that I would not want to pay for. The 160-degree viewing angle suggests to me that this is not an advanced LCD panel and instead is a run-of-the-mill TN+film type. The reason why they are going toward this technology instead of IPS or VA is because it is simply cheaper. I for one will be staying away.
