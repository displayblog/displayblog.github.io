<p><a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2012/chip-power-heat-vibration-light-0709.html">MIT</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Previous work from the lab of MIT professor Anantha Chandrakasan has focused on the development of computer and wireless-communication chips that can operate at extremely low power levels, and on a variety of devices that can harness power from natural light, heat and vibrations in the environment. The latest development, carried out with doctoral student Saurav Bandyopadhyay, is a chip that could harness all three of these ambient power sources at once, optimizing power delivery.</blockquote></p>
<p>Now lets take the next step and integrate this chip into glass.</p>
