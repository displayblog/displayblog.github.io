<p><a href="http://en.akihabaranews.com/67797/home-entertainment/ortustech-introduce-the-world-smallest-full-hd-hyper-amorphous-silicon-tft?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ortustech-introduce-the-world-smallest-full-hd-hyper-amorphous-silicon-tft">Akihabara News</a>: Ortustech just outed a 4.8-inch LCD packing 1920x1080 pixels. That translates into a pixel density of 458.94 PPI. These are RGB pixels just like the ones in your notebook, LCD monitor and LCD TV. Viewing angles are 160/160 and the color gamut is 72% NTSC.</p>
<p>The technology used is called Hyper Amorphous Silicon TFT or HAST. Almost all LCDs today use amorphous silicon (a-Si) silicon so the special thing about HAST is that it is 'hyper', which represents the technology that allows for so many pixels to be crammed into so little space.</p>
<p>What I'm looking forward to is a smartphone that sports a 3.5- to 4-inch display with a true HD pixel format of 1280x720 or more. I think we are not too far from such a display.</p>
