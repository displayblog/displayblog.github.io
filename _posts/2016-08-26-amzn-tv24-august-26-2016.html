<p>Here's <a href="http://displayblog.com/2016/08/25/amzn-tv24/">a&nbsp;brief description of AMZN.TV24</a>. In the inaugural AMZN.TV24 post I shared some brand share insights. Today I'll share some data about&nbsp;size share trends.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26829" src="http://displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/AMZNTV24_20160826_SizeShare.jpg" alt="AMZN.TV24 2016.08.26 Size Share" width="590" height="398" /></p>
<p>Here are some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>55-inch has been and continue to be dominant.</li>
<li>65-inch is #2.</li>
<li>60-inch is #3.</li>
<li>And 50-inch is #4.</li><br />
</ul><br />
In a future post I will delineate between 4K and 1080p, but today I'll stick to just sizes. The front page of Amazon's TV search result is 38% 55-inch TVs. Only a couple of years ago 55-inch TVs were considered "Wow! That's huge!" But now, I think 55-inch is closing in on a minimum size for a new living room TV.</p>
<p>What's interesting is that 60-inch TVs are not #2, but 65-inch TVs are. That's a 10-inch jump. There are reasons for that -- 65-inch pricing, 4K vs. 1080p, etc. -- but it's interesting to note 65-inch TVs take up 21%. Perhaps another possible reason is Samsung, the brand with 50% share, is optimized for manufacturing 65-inch LCD panels, making a lot of them, and marketing them aggressively.</p>
<p>Another interesting thought is numbers that end with 0 (zero) is not as popular as numbers that end with non-zeros, such as 5. 55 versus 50. 65 versus 60. 55 sounds better than 50. And so does 65. Just a thought.</p>
<p>One last note about the size share trend data: 50-inch grabbed 20%+ share a couple of times, but I think 55-inch and 65-inch will continue being dominant and will increase&nbsp;share.</p>
<p>I hope the data and insights were helpful to you. The next topic will be 4K versus 1080p share trends, which I'll post tomorrow.</p>
