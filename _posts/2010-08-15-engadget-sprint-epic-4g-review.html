<p>Engadget's <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/08/16/epic-4g-review/">Chris Ziegler reviews the Sprint Epic 4G</a>, a Samsung Galaxy S phone. Here's the bottom line regarding the 4-inch 800x480 Super AMOLED:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Epic's 4-inch Super AMOLED display at WVGA resolution is exactly the same as the one you find on the Captivate and Vibrant -- and as you can probably guess, it's absolutely glorious. If you're not accustomed to these displays (even if you're already familiar with standard AMOLED), you'll be pretty shocked by the insane black level and the rich, dazzling color saturation that you get from these. Despite what you may have heard to the contrary, we'll echo what we said in our look at the AT&T and T-Mobile models that it still doesn't perform as well as a traditional LCD in direct sunlight, though it isn't completely washed out; in our experience, we could always make out the contents of the screen if we squinted hard enough.</blockquote></p>
