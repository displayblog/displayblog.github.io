<p>Cambridge Display Technology (CDT) is Cambridge, UK-based pioneer of polymer light emitting diode (P-OLED) technology. CDT has begun work on metal deposition that will be a critical piece in bringing flexible displays to the market. This project involves devloping a process to deposit metal tracks that are conductive and very thin onto glass and plastic substrates. This method competes against another technology called inkjet printing. Metal deposition uses lasers to expose materials as small as 5 microns. CDT's partners include Conductive Inkjet Technology, a subsidiary of Carclo plc, and Exitech, a laser processing equipment supplier. CDT is targeting a mid-2007 timeframe for initial results of this project.</p>
<p>The government is supporting this project and is partly funded by the UK Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). The UK has identified plastic electronics as a key technology area.</p>
