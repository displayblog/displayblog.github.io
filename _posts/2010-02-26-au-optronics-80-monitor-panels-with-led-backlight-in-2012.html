<p>AU Optronics (AUO) is aggressively shifting to LED as a light source for LCD backlights for LCD monitors, LCD TVs and notebook PCs.&Acirc;&nbsp;AUO president and CEO LJ Chen stated 80% of LCD monitor panels will feature LED backlights in 2012, growing significantly from an expected 30% in 2010. The global average is forecasted to be just 17% this year. 65% of LCD TV panels will go LED by 2012, another major jump from an expected 20% this year. And by 2011 all notebook PC LCD panels will be LED backlit. The days are numbered for CCFL as a light source for LCD backlights.
