<p><a href="http://www.displaysearch.com/cps/rde/xchg/displaysearch/hs.xsl/110818_apple_retakes_top_mobile_pc_market_share_position_from_hp_in_q2_11.asp">DisplaySearch</a>:</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple shipped over 13.5 million mobile PCs in Q2&acirc;&euro;&trade;11 for 136% Y/Y shipment growth, overtaking HP for the top spot, according to preliminary results from the latest DisplaySearch <a href="http://www.displaysearch.com/cps/rde/xchg/displaysearch/hs.xsl/quarterly_mobile_pc_shipment_and_forecast_report.asp"><em>Quarterly Mobile PC Shipment and Forecast Report</em></a>. Nearly 80% of Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s mobile PC shipments were iPads, which reached over 10.7 million units, for 107% Y/Y growth. Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s total mobile PC shipments (notebook and tablet PCs) were 3.9 million units more than HP&acirc;&euro;&trade;s nearly 9.7 million units for the quarter.</p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>Here's the breakdown:</p></p>
<ol>
<li>Apple, 13.6 million, 21.1%</li>
<li>HP, 9.7, 15.0%</li>
<li>Dell, 7.5, 11.6%</li>
<li>Acer, 7.0, 10.9%</li>
<li>Lenovo, 4.8, 7.5%</li><br />
</ol></p>
<p>I am unsure that the iPad should be in the "mobile PC" category. The internals of the iPod touch, iPhone, and the iPad are very similar. All three use the same OS. Why aren't the other two included in this definition?</p></p>
<p>DisplaySearch defines mobile PCs as notebooks and tablet PCs, but what makes a tablet PC a tablet PC? The size of the display? Would the 5-inch Samsung Galaxy Player 5 be classified as a tablet PC?</p></p>
<p>When it becomes difficult to slot in new devices into old categories, it's safe to say we're in the middle of a wholesale transition. It's also safe to say Apple is kicking butt.</p></p>
