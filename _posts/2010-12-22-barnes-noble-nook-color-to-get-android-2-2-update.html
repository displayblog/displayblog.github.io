<p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/12/15/nook_froyo/">The Register</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The NOOKcolor e-reader, from Barnes & Noble, is going to get Android 2.2 (Froyo) next month, very nearly turning the $250 e-reader into a usable tablet computer.</p>
<p>We say very nearly, because it seems that Google's Android Marketplace won't be available on the NOOKcolor, which will instead get its own application store run by Barnes & Noble. </blockquote></p>
<p>What would prevent the Nook Color from being upgraded to the tablet-oriented version of Android: Honeycomb? But even with the latest and greatest Android OS the Nook Color won't be fast enough to be used as a full-blown tablet. The lag between when you touch and when it responds will drive you nuts. As an e-reader I'm sure the Nook Color will do just fine, but that's not why you're hoping to get to Android 2.2 and beyond...</p>
