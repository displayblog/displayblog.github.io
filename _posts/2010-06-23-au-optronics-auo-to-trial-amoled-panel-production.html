<p>Taiwan-based AU Optronics (AUO) is modifying its Gen 3.5 low-temperature poly-silicon (LTPS) fabrication plant for small/medium AMOLED panel production. The modification is expected to be finalized at the end of the third quarter and AMOLED panel trial production is planned to commence at the end of 2010. Although AUO successfully manufactured large-size AMOLED sample panels at its Gen 6 fab, for the technology to mature it will require an additional two to three years. Compared to the recent announcement by Samsung Mobile Display (SMD) regarding the construction of a Gen 5.5 AMOLED fab (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/22/samsung-mobile-display-to-invest-us2-1-billion-for-oled-plant/">Samsung Mobile Display To Invest US$2.1 Billion For OLED Plant</a></em> for more info), AUO's AMOLED plan seems small, but still these announcements are signs pointing toward increasing momentum toward OLED display technology, especially for smartphone applications. LG Display (LGD) is also expected to invest KRW250 billion in the second half of 2011 to triple its AMOLED production capacity.</p>
