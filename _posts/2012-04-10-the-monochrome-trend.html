<blockquote><p>In other words, when we look at a user interface, we can find and identify user interface elements with a specific color really quickly and easily.</blockquote></p>
<p>I completely agree ease of use in user interface design is critically important. But I think the elimination of most user interface elements, colored or monochrome, would significantly improve overall usability, more so than if color was reintroduced to monochrome elements.</p>
