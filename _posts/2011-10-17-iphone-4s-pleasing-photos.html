<blockquote><p>Overall, we were most pleased with photos we shot with the iPhone 4S, despite its lack of advanced features.</blockquote></p>
<p>The competition: iPhone 4, Samsung Galaxy S II, Nokia N8, HTC Amaze 4G. All had 8MP sensors except for the N8, which packed 12MP and the 5MP iPhone 4. The Amaze 4G had the fastest lens at f/2.2.</p>
