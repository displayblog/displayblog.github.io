<p>Shanshan Wang and Neil Gough, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/business/international/release-of-iphone-6-delayed-in-china.html">The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Wednesday, Apple told China&acirc;&euro;&trade;s three big state-owned mobile service providers that it would not release the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in mainland China on Sept. 19, when sales start elsewhere.</blockquote></p>
<p>Why, no one knows for sure, but:</p>
<blockquote><p>News reports in China on Wednesday said the iPhone 6 had not yet been approved by the Ministry for Industry and Information Technology, which must sign off on the technology of devices like smartphones. No approval for the iPhone 6 could be found on the regulator&acirc;&euro;&trade;s website on Wednesday.</blockquote></p>
<p>Did not someone at Apple invite members of the Ministry for Industry and Information Technology to a very special banquet reserved only for them? Did not the special guests experience the finest cuisine, entertainment, and a special iPhone 6 presentation? Did not each member receive a special gift: a limited edition platinum Apple Watch Edition with red leather and a custom China watch face?</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
