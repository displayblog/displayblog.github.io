<p>20 billion yen (US$178 million) is what Pioneer is planning to spend to boost capacity for plasma display panels (PDPs). Between Q4&#39;06 - Q1&#39;07 is when the company will start construction and will hit 300K - 400K units annually. President Tamihiko Sudo said that it would take 2-3 years for Pioneer to be profitable again.</p>
<p>I think Pioneer should partner with someone. By combining financial and technological resources, plasma players should be able to maintain its lead over LCD in larger sizes, which are 50" and up for now.</p>
