<p>[ <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/9686/the-apple-iphone-6s-and-iphone-6s-plus-review">AnandTech</a> ] Ryan Smith &amp; Joshua Ho:</p>
<blockquote><p>As with the iPhone 6, both the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus use dual domain pixels, which make the subpixels look more like chevrons under a microscope. This improves viewing angles by reducing the amount of color shifting that occurs when the display viewing angle is changed. As far as I can tell, Apple continues to be one of the few OEMs that pulls this off effectively. Although contrast and luminance aren&rsquo;t perfectly consistent with changes in viewing angles, it basically looks like the display is painted underneath the glass. The iPhone 6s Plus does a better job at pulling off this illusion as the higher pixel density helps to eliminate some of the fuzziness or pixilation that might otherwise occur.</blockquote><br />
I consider color accuracy very important because I'd like the photos I take to look&nbsp;as close to the real thing as possible.</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 in Basic screen mode produces detailed photos with extremely accurate colors. There are&nbsp;two&nbsp;areas where the Note 4 falls a little short of excellent. One is with red colors: reds are slightly washed out and sometimes appear to verge on orange. The other is lag. The Note 4 makes me wait a little bit before I can review the photo.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you&rsquo;re using an iPhone 6s or 6s Plus for any remotely color-critical work like viewing and/or editing photos and videos, it&rsquo;s a pretty fair bet that you&rsquo;ll be able to rely on these phones to provide an accurate color reproduction in pretty much any condition.</blockquote></p>
