<p>LG's Clear Filter is a single thin film that is placed in front of the plasma panel instead of a thick glass filter enabling plasma panels to be slimmer. LG is introducing 42" plasma XGA (1024 x 768) TVs that incorporates its Clear Filter and is planning to use the film in larger versions. By replacing the thick glass filter, Clear Filter also makes the plasma panel lighter. Also, the thick glass filter some times produces a double image reflection and LG's Clear Fitler eliminates that problem by controling light reflection resulting in more vivid colors. Plasma TVs have generally poorer performance in high ambient environments compared to LCD TVs, but with Clear Filter that gap in performance is reduced.</p>
