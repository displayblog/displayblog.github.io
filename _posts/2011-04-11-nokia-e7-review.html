<blockquote><p>The 4-inch ClearBlack AMOLED touchscreen is bright and beautiful, even in direct sunlight. Colors are vivid, and contrast and viewing angles are excellent, as you'd expect from this type of display. Interestingly, the US version exhibits a slightly warmer color temperature. Resolution is a different story, and pixel-density enthusiasts will be disappointed. With a mere 640 x 360 pixels (what Nokia calls nHD), the E7 makes even a 4.3-inch WVGA display look high definition. Of course, we realize this is a limitation imposed by software, but in this day and age of qHD devices, it misses the mark. We also observed some strange color banding on our European review unit (see here), which might be a manufacturing defect since the problem is absent from the other one. A sheet of Gorilla Glass protects the touchscreen and houses the proximity and light sensors, the earpiece, and a front-facing camera (VGA). Strangely our US model acquired a few small scratches on the display within hours of being unboxed, despite being treated gently, while the other one survived an entire rough and tumble week at CTIA unscathed.</blockquote></p>
<p>640x360 pixels combined with a largish 4-inch OLED display makes for a resolution of almost 184 ppi. Compare that with the class-leading 326 ppi on the 3.5-inch Retina Display on the iPhone 4 with a pixel format of 960x640 and clearly the Nokia E7 is behind the times. Of course, comparing an OLED display with a LCD when it comes to pixel density isn't really comparing apples to apples. Cramming pixels into OLED displays is a much more difficult task. This 4-inch OLED is most likely using a RGB sub-pixel structure when most other 800x480 are using Nouvoyance's PenTile Matrix sub-pixel structure. And what's up with the Gorilla Glass that's easily being scratched?</p>
