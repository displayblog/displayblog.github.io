<p>Mark Lee and Janet Ong at <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-04-01/acer-sets-sights-on-apple-htc-after-hp-chase-stumbles.html">Bloomberg Businessweek</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Gianfranco Lanci tried to make Acer Inc. the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s largest laptop maker by outselling Hewlett- Packard Co. The board says he should have set his sights on Apple Inc. and HTC Corp. instead.</blockquote></p>
