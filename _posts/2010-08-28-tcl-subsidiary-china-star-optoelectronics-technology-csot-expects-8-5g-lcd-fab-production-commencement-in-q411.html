<p>China Star Optoelectronics Technology (CSOT), a subsidiary of TCL, is expected to begin equipment installation at its 8.5G TFT LCD fabrication plant in May 2011 and commence mass production of LCD panels in the fourth quarter according to company CEO Cheng-Ming He. CSOT's 8.5G LCD fab will focus on 26, 32, 46, and 55 inch LCD TV panels.</p>
<p>TCL and Century Science & Technology Investment share 50% each of CSOT. 170 or so key engineers have been recruited from Taiwan and Korea. CSOT is aiming to bring component suppliers close to its 8.5G fab and has already signed a cooperation agreement with glass substrate suppliers. Co-location of a primary glass supplier will be important in improving LCD panel production efficiency. Source: <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20100827PD213.html">Digitimes Displays</a></p>
