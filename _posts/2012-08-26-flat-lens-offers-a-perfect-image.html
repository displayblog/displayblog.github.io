<p><a href="http://www.seas.harvard.edu/news-events/press-releases/flat-lens-offers-perfect-image">School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Applied physicists at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) have created an ultrathin, flat lens that focuses light without imparting the distortions of conventional lenses.</p>
<p>At a mere 60 nanometers thick, the flat lens is essentially two-dimensional, yet its focusing power approaches the ultimate physical limit set by the laws of diffraction.</blockquote></p>
<p>Flat lenses... can't wait.</p>
