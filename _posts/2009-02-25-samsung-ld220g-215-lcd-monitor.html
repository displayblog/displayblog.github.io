<p>Samsung is quite innovative and the LD220G is a case in point. The LD220G is an LCD monitor but built so that it fits beside a notebook PC. I have often used an external monitor connected to a notebook PC and it takes some time to find the perfect position for it. The LD220G makes it simple: put it right next to your notebook PC. Your neck will thank you since you won't need to look up and down to view the monitor.</p>
<p>The LD220G sports a 21.5" TFT LCD and allows you to tilt it so the angle is the same as your notebook PC.&Acirc;&nbsp;The connection is via Samsung's UbiSync technology that connects via the USB port. Simple. The only caveat might be that you'll need to push back the notebook PC a bit to bring in both LCDs in view without having to swing your head back and forth. And to do that you'll probably need an external keyboard and mouse.</p>
