<p>[ <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/08/29/iphone-6-touch-disease-class-action-lawsuit/">MacRumors</a> ] Joe Rossignol:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thomas Davidson of Pennsylvania, Todd Cleary of California, and Jun Bai of Delaware have filed a class action lawsuit against Apple over an alleged defect that causes iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus touchscreens to become unresponsive and fail, according to court documents filed electronically this week.</blockquote><br />
Alleged defect? I don't think so;&nbsp;see for yourself: <a href="http://displayblog.com/2016/08/29/iphone-6-and-6-plus-unresponsive-touchscreen/">iPhone 6 and 6 Plus Unresponsive Touchscreen</a>.&nbsp;There have been more than a few Touch Diseased iPhone 6 and 6 Plus owners who have had terrible experiences.</p>
<p>There are consequences when your overarching goal is to make the iPhone thinner. A metal shield over the touchscreen controller chips would have made it more difficult for that part of the logic board to bend, when the iPhone bends. (Read the article linked above for a more detailed analysis of why the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus touchscreen becomes unresponsive.) But the added metal shield adds thickness. When thinness becomes more important than some other considerations, which should actually more important, users suffer from bad experiences.</p>
<p>What did Apple do&nbsp;to solve this problem in the iPhone 6s and the 6s Plus? Apple&nbsp;moved those controller chips somewhere else, to the display assembly to be specific.</p>
