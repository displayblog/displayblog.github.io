<p>I wanted to share with you a new feature of DisplayBlog: <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/databases/">the DATABASES menu</a>. What do I intend to do? I wish I could tell you everything but I am simply not the best planner in the world. And even if I was due to my enormously lazy body I would be able to fulfill only a small portion of those plans. So with that bit, my current plan is to continue updating the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/08/06/database-ips-lcd-monitor/">IPS LCD Monitor database</a> and in the longer term introduce other relevant lists that would be helpful to you. If you would like to see a particular database related to the display industry let me know by sending me an email at <a href="mailto:jin@displayblog.com">jin@displayblog.com</a>. In the mean time, click on <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/databases/">the DATABASES menu</a> item and look through the IPS LCD Monitor database that I have created. IPS-based LCD monitors are, in my opinion, the best monitors you can buy!</p>
