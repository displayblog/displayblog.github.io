<p>I'll focus on the HP Envy 14's display:</p>
<blockquote><p>The 14.5-inch, 1,600 x 900-resolution display is a breath of fresh air compared to the laptops we've recently reviewed. Not only is the resolution better than the 1366 x 768 displays we've been staring at lately, but the quality of the flush glass LCD is miles better than the others HP's used lately. A lot of that has to do with the HP Radiance Infinity LED panel, which was also on the Envy 13. The 350nit display has a higher color gamut than other displays, and you notice the difference upon first boot -- even the blue of the Windows Start button sticks out more than on other screens.</blockquote></p>
<p>Colors pop. That can be a good thing or a bad thing. I don't like overblown colors; I much prefer accurate ones. Viewing angles were good according to Engadget. I'm not sure what the "flush glass LCD" is suppose to mean but if it is referring to a possible optically laminated LCD like the one we see on the iPhone 4's Retina Display then this 14.5-inch display should be quite nice. But I have my doubts.</p>
<p>One comment about the pixel format: 1600x900 is a nice even number but it really isn't good for anything. You see 720p HD content has to be scaled up. 1080p HD content has to be scaled down. All HD has to be scaled so the overall video quality will be less than ideal. I would much prefer horizontal pixels that match 1280 or 1920.
