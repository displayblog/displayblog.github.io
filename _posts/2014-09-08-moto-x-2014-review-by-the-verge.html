<p>Dan Seifert, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/8/6121143/motorola-moto-x-2014-new-review">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But the new Moto X is a different animal. It has a 5.2-inch, 1080p AMOLED display that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s bigger than what the latest from HTC and Samsung offer. And it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a high quality screen: it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s sharper, brighter, bigger, and just nicer to look at than the previous model. It has tremendous viewing angles, punchy colors, and can be seen in bright sunlight without issue. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s everything the display on a flagship smartphone in 2014 should be.</blockquote></p>
<p>Not <em>everything</em>. Everything would include 2560x1440 pixels.</p>
<blockquote><p>The new 13-megapixel camera is an improvement over last year&acirc;&euro;&trade;s 10-megapixel model, but it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not as dramatically better as the new screen and processor are. From what I can tell, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a similar sensor to what&acirc;&euro;&trade;s in a lot of Android smartphones, and it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not as good as the best from Samsung, Apple, or Nokia.</blockquote></p>
<p>The best from Apple will be even better tomorrow. Pass.</p>
