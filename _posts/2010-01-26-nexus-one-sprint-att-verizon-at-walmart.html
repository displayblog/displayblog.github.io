<p><a href="http://walmart.letstalk.com/product/product.htm?prId=36582&amp;search=nexus+one#description">Walmart Wireless</a> via <a href="http://androidandme.com/2010/01/news/99-nexus-one-coming-to-walmart-with-att-sprint-and-verizon-3g/">Android and Me</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/26/walmart-greeters-will-soon-welcome-you-to-a-nexus-one-with-sprin/">Engadget</a>: Soon you'll be able to pick up a Nexus One from Walmart. And not the Nexus One crippled to use on T-Mobile's 3G-limited network but the one that works on the network of your choice: Sprint, Verizon or AT&amp;T. And some say the price might be a door-buster at just US$99. The Engadget article speculates the possibility of a single Nexus One model able to connect to all of the aforementioned wireless carriers, but I doubt it.</p>
