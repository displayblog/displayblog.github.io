<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/apples-first-ceo-michael-scott-2011-5?op=1">Michael Scott</a>, first CEO of Apple, regarding Steve Jobs:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Apple II case came, it had a beige and a green, so for all the standard colors of beige available in the world, of which there are thousands, none was exactly proper for him. So we actually had to create "Apple beige" and get that registered.</blockquote></p>
