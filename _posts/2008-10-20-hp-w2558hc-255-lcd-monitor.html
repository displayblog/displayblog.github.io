  and enjoy the slideshow. When the PC is on, it acts as a normal card reader. This
  is pretty cool. "

<p>HP has done a great job of designing the stand that allows for tilting, pivoting and height adjustment. The default font size on a 24" LCD monitor with a pixel format of 1920 x 1200 running Windows XP look just fine to me. But if you would like to have fonts a little bigger without having to mess around with the DPI settings in Windows XP (or Vista) and are in the market for a main LCD monitor, it might be prudent to investigate a 25.5" LCD monitor such as the w2558hc.</p>
