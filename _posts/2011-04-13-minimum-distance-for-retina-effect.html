<p>Eric Rucker, DisplayBlog reader, in response to <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/04/12/htc-sensation-4g/">HTC Sensation 4G</a> where I suggested using the 256-ppi Sensation 4G from a distance of more than 12 inches to get the Retina effect:</p>
<blockquote><p>If I recall correctly, the definition is a display that exceeds the average human's ability to resolve individual pixels. Therefore, a display need not be 326 ppi to be a retina display at 12" - in fact, with 20/20 vision, 286.5 is the magic number.</blockquote></p>
<p>Rucker also developed a neat <a href="http://bhtooefr.ath.cx/displaycalc.htm">JavaScript Display Calculator</a> that gives you: aspect ratio, ppi, minimum Retina viewing distance, etc. According to Rucker's Calculator to get the Retina effect on the iPhone 4 you need to use it from at least 10.4 inches assuming you have 20/20 vision. For the Sensation 4G the distance is at least 13.4 inches.</p>
