<p>Chunghwa Picture Tubes (CPT) won a larger order from TCL, a major TV maker in China. That in turn will be a boon for Radiant Opto-Electronics Corp. that makes backlight modules for LCD panels. Radiant is expecting a doubling of shipments from July to August as CPT's LCD TV panel shipments to TCL grows from 170,000 in August to more than 200,000 in September, a major increase from only 80,000 and 100,000 units in June and July, respectively. Radiant has five fabs located in the Kaohsiung Economic Processing Zone in Taiwan.</p>
<p>K-Bridge Electronics used to supply CPT with backlight modules but CPT has moved closer to Radiant recently and plans to give sole supplier status to Radiant for TCL orders in the second half of 2006. Radiant's monthly LCD TV backlight unit shipments were 50,000 in the first quarter of this year. Due to an inventory buildup of LCD panels, Taiwanese backlight module suppliers had to downward adjust production goals. However, second half demand is expected to make a strong recovery.</p>
