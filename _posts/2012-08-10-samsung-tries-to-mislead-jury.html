<blockquote><p>Johnson then challenged Balakrishnan by giving a live demonstration of a 7-inch Galaxy Tab that didn't incorporate the bounce-back feature &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; while neglecting to mention what operating system or skin it was running. He followed it up with a video that he said proved the Galaxy Tab 10.1 didn't use the feature either. Unfortunately for Johnson, Balakrishnan had to point out that in the video the user wasn't actually scrolling to the end of the web page in question &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; a requirement to trigger the feature in the first place.</blockquote></p>
