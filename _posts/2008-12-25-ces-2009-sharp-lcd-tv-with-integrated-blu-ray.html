<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-3577 aligncenter" title="sharp_aquos_42_lcd_tv_blu_ray" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/sharp_aquos_42_lcd_tv_blu_ray.jpg" alt="sharp_aquos_42_lcd_tv_blu_ray" width="500" height="347" /></p></p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sharp">Sharp</a>, the company will be releasing two AQUOS LCD TVs with integrated <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=blu-ray">Blu-ray</a> players at the Consumer Electronics Show 2009. The duo will be commercially available right after CES. One will be <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=32"">32"</a> and the other 42". The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=42"-lcd-tv">42" LCD TV</a> will feature a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a> pixel format and be able to show Blu-ray titles in their full glory.</p>
<p>One of the best features of an all-in-one design like this is that you don't have to mess around with additional plugs whether they be HDMI, component or power supply. Although I am not a fan of designs that integrated a TV and a player (our extremely old <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=toshiba">Toshiba</a> CRT TV with an integrated VHS player has a broken VHS player), I think the Blu-ray player will most likely last just as long as the TV. The 42" LCD TV with integrate Blu-ray player is estimated to be around $2000.</p>
<p>Another component that I would like to see integrated well is the speaker system. Is it too much to ask for decent speakers on the LCD TVs? I think the time is right to cut all the extraneous cables and put the speakers and the Blu-ray player into a nice seamless design with an easy-to-use user interface.</p>
