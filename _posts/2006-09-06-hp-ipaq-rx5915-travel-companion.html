<p>The rx5915 has a 3.5" QVGA (that would be 320 x 240 resolution) touch display, 2GB of flash memory, 64MB of RAM and a SDIO slot to expand your memory and connectivity options. Although the 320 x 240 resolution seems like a good standard to go with, there is just no easy way of surfing the Internet with such a low-resolution screen. Samsung just announced <a href="http://displayblog.wordpress.com/2006/08/25/samsung-198-vga-lcd/">very small-sized VGA (640 x 480) screens</a> and I would hope guys like HP realizes that Internet-based apps are what we would like to access with gadgets like the rx5915. 3.5" VGA, please. The rx5915 also has Bluetooth 2.0, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. From the picture below, you can see that the rx5915 has navigation capabilities. It seems the CPU is Samsung's ARM-based line that runs at 400MHz. <img src="http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.engadget.com/media/2006/09/hp-ipaq-rx5000.jpg" border="0" hspace="4" vspace="4" /></p>
<p>It doesn't exactly mention it in Engadget's article, but the ARM-based Samsung processors that reach 400MHz is limited to the L13HS-1136JF, L9G-1136/56/76JF processors.</p>
