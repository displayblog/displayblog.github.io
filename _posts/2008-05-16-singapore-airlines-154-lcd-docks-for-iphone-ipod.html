<p>Singapore Airlines is my favorite when traveling to Asia from where I am in San Jose, California. I almost always fly coach (forced to due to budgetary pressures) and even then I am glued to the tiny LCD screen watching a bunch of movies. One time I was flying out of SFO to ICN (Inchon, South Korea) on a Singapore Airlines Boeing 777 and by the time I had to turn off the LCD, I was almost done with my fifth movie! Boy, was that great! Back to the news...</p>

<p>Singapore Airlines' business class passengers on its A340-500 flights between New York, Los Angeles and Singapore will be treated with a generous <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=15.4"">15.4"</a> LCD and docks for <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=apple">Apple</a>'s <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=iphone">iPhone</a> and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=ipod">iPod</a>s. Noise-cancellation headphones are included so you won't be bothered with the engine noise when wanting to listen to some good music or watch a movie. A340-500 flights out of Newark, NY began May 15 while the lucky Los Angeles business passengers can expect the nice amenities starting August.</p>
