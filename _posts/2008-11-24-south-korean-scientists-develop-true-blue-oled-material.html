It must mean that the color blue is more blue than cyan. With an improved OLED material for blue, I would assume that the efficacy of the material is improved so that energy efficiency is increased. In turn, that would mean that the resulting OLED display will consume less energy. There will also be no need for compensation circuitry that pumps more electricity for aging blue materials to maintain color fidelity.</p>
