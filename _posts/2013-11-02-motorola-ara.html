<p><a href="http://motorola-blog.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/goodbye-sticky-hello-ara.html">The Official Motorola Blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Led by Motorola&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Advanced Technology and Projects group, Project Ara is developing a free, open hardware platform for creating highly modular smartphones. We want to do for hardware what the Android platform has done for software: create a vibrant third-party developer ecosystem, lower the barriers to entry, increase the pace of innovation, and substantially compress development timelines.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Motorola Ara is an idea I could get behind. Instead of getting a brand new smartphone every two years, I could upgrade just the part that needs upgrading? Sounds good, but is this a realistic possibility?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.3dsystems.com/press-releases/3d-systems-and-motorola-partner-modular-custom-smartphone#.Uo-AB5EV3na">3D Systems</a>, a Rock Hill, South Carolina based provider of 3D print solutions announced its multi-year agreement with Motorola Mobility LLC to develop advanced manufacturing and fulfillment platforms to support Motorola's Project Ara:</p>
<blockquote><p>As part of this agreement, 3D Systems plans to substantially expand its multi-material printing capabilities including conductive and functional materials. The company also plans to combine additive and subtractive manufacturing methods, and deliver an integrated high-speed production platform. Pending successful completion of the development phase, 3D Systems is expected to manufacture 3D-printed Ara smartphone enclosures and modules as Motorola&acirc;&euro;&trade;s exclusive fulfillment partner.</blockquote></p>
<p>This is getting exciting.</p>
