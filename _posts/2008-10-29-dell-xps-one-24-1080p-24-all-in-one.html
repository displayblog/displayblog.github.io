<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dell">Dell</a> has improved its <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=all-in-one">all-in-one</a> offering the XPS One: XPS One 24. Now it has a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=24"">24"</a> TFT LCD. Gizmodo is reporting that it has a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1080p">1080p</a> 24" LCD. I am assuming that means it has an aspect ratio of 16:9 and a pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a>. I guess Dell is thinking that a lot of folks who buy the XPS One 24 will be using it to view 16:9 HD content. I don't think Dell is completely wrong about that assumption but I think most users don't mind those little black bars especially if that means they get an extra 120 vertical pixels. I'd take the extra 120 vertical pixels in exchange for two little black bars when watching 16:9 HD content. The GPU is the new-and-improved NVIDIA GeForce 9600M GT.
