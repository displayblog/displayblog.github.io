<p>Jon Bell at <a href="http://designdare.com/the-capacitive-button-cult-must-be-stopped">Design Dare</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A capacitive button has no place on a phone, and the people who are pushing it into the marketplace are over-fetishizing visual design to the detriment of the overall experience. Which is a bit of a pet peeve of mine.</blockquote></p>
<p>I don't like it either.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> Here's what <a href="http://ignorethecode.net/blog/2011/07/04/the_capacitive_button_cult_must_be_stopped/">Lukas Mathis</a> says about capacitive buttons on phones:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think phones have capacitive buttons for the same reason laptops have reflective screens, and TVs in stores have their brightness and contrast turned all the way up. It looks really cool when you see it in a store, and you don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t notice how screwed up it really is until after you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve already bought it.</blockquote></p>
<p>Nothing but show.</p>
