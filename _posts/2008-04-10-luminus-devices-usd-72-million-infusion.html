<p>On March 19, 2008, Luminus Devices raised USD 72 million in a new round of financing. The company will expand its Phlatlight <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led">LED</a> chipsets into the general lighting applications such as medical, entertainment and homeland security. The participating companies in this funding round were Boston-based Braemar Energy Ventures, San Francisco-based CMEA Ventures and DC-based Paladin Capital Group in addition to all of the previously investing companies.</p>

<p>Currently, the company's Phlatlight LED products are being incorporated into projection TVs (DLP, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcos">LCoS</a>, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=3lcd">3LCD</a>) and digital projectors. The company must forge ahead into different markets because the projection TV market is collapsing as companies such as Sony has withdrawn its excellent <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sxrd">SXRD</a>-based (LCoS) <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=rear-projection-tv">rear projection TV</a>s (RPTVs) from the US market. The shift to LCD TVs is strong and is expected to be strong for the foreseeable future. Luminus Devices is working hard to finalize its Phlatlight LED products so that it can be incorporated into the LCD TV <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led">LED</a>-based backlights and demonstrated a Phlatlight-based backlight unit (BLU) during CES 2008 back in January. The company expects volume production later this year.</p>
