<p>The $599 price for the ViewSonic ViewPad 7 is the same you'd pay for a Samsung Galaxy Tab. There is one major difference between the two: with the ViewPad 7 you can make voice calls. On the display side of things the 7-inch ViewPad has a limited number of pixels with 800x480. The Galaxy Tab beats it with 1024x600. If voice calls are important to you and you are set on the ViewPad 7, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ALMF6C?ie=UTF8&tag=displ0f-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004ALMF6C">Amazon</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=displ0f-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B004ALMF6C" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> is taking pre-orders. Consider using that link to purchase as I'll get a little kickback. Thanks!</p>
