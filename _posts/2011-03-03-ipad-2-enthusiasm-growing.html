<p>Gartner research director George Shiffler <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/gartner-ipad-growth-will-dramatically-slow-demand-for-home-mobile-pcs/84812">Cult of Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We expect growing consumer enthusiasm for mobile PC alternatives, such as the iPad and other media tablets, to dramatically slow home mobile PC sales, especially in mature markets.</blockquote></p>
<p>Translation: netbooks, notebooks, laptops, etc. for the home will get kicked in the nuts by the new iPad 2, and other tablets. With one exception: MacBooks.</p>
