<p>On February 6, 2008, Corning announced that its BOD has approved a US$453 million investment toward expanding its LCD glass substrate manufacturing capacity &Acirc;&nbsp;in Taichung, Taiwan. The Taichung glass facility currently manufactures Gen. 5 glass and larger substrates, including Gen. 8, using the company's Eagle XG glass, an environmentally friendly glass that does not have any heavy metals. The glass facility opened in 2006 and the current expansion will be its fourth phase of expansion. Phase 4 mass production will begin in Q1'09 and will target the LCD TV market.</p>
