<p><em>Update 2010.09.10</em> There's going to be a Q&A session with LG executives after the digital press conference but the questions will be accepted exclusively via Twitter: @lgoptimuslaunch.</p>
<p>LG is holding a Digital Press Conference on the 14th of September at 6pm Korea time and it seems it will be centered around the company's Optimus brand. From the looks of it LG is probably introducing its Optimus tablet. Rumor has it the name will be Optimus Pad.</p>
