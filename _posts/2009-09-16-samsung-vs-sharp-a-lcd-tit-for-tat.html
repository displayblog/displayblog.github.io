  for LCD patient infringement. Just another twist in the two-year long fight between
  the two LCD TV brands. If Sharp wins Samsung can be barred from selling its LCD
  TVs in the US. The six-member US International Trade Commission (ITC) based in Washington
  DC said on September 16 that Samsung violated four of Sharp's patents and ordered
  both companies to submit arguments as to whether an import ban should be imposed.
  Let me guess what the two companies will say: Samsung will say no to the ban pointing
  to a negative impact on the already weak US economy with the company having about
  20% of the market and stating that consumers will be left without a clear option
  if Samsung LCD TVs were not available. Sharp would say yes to the ban because it
  violates the company's patent. "

<p><strong>Ban Ban Ban</strong> The ITC has been ban-happy and has banned LCD TVs made by Sharp and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=vizio&amp;sa=Search#1348">Vizio</a> thanks to another patent infringement case brought on by a name nobody knows in the US: <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=funai&amp;sa=Search#1394">Funai Electric</a>. If the ITC decides to ban Samsung the commission will be banning about 45% of the entire US market for LCD TVs. Vizio is appealing an ITC order that was imposed earlier this year to stop importing its LCD TVs, all thanks to Funai. By the way, Funai bought the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=philips&amp;sa=Search#1348">Philips</a> brand for sale in the US.</p>
<p>Just back in June, the ITC ruled that some Sharp AQUOS LCD TVs should be banned because they infringe on a Samsung patent. The ITC will make a final decision regarding the import ban by November 9. If the ITC decides the ban should be imposed the decision can be reviewed by US President Barack Obama, who can overturn the decision if he believes the ban may not be in the public's interest.</p>
