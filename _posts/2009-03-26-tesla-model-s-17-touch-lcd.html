<p>Tesla just unveiled its 4-door electric car: the Model S. The Model S is sexy and high-tech in all the right ways. And it is, of course, an electric car. The Model S sits seven people, has a 300-mile range thanks to 8000 battery cells (2000 more than the Roadster), can be charged in just 4 hours with a 220v outlet and can accelerate up to 60mph in 6 seconds or less. All of this and more point to a very nice car. And the price? $50K.</p>

<p>Now, let's get to displays. Yes, the Model S has a very nice LCD and it's big. 17" big. Take a look at the picture and you'll see that the LCD is huge compared to anything that's out there today. Tesla used such a massive display to get rid of buttons, most of them anyway. The LCD will be touch enabled and 3G-connected. I do see a little glare. Also, take a closer look at the instrument cluster: it looks like a display and not a physical instrument panel. There are many more pictures over at Autoblog.</p>
