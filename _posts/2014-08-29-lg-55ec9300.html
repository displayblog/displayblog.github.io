<p>The <a href="http://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-55EC9300-oled-tv">LG 55EC9300</a> is a 55-inch curved OLED TV with a pixel format of 1920x1080. Each pixel has four sub-pixels (red, green, blue, and white), which LG calls <a href="http://www.lg.com/us/experience-tvs/oled-tv/oled-display">4 Color Pixel</a>, and the result is &acirc;&euro;&oelig;a brighter picture with a wider range of colors and superior color accuracy.&acirc;&euro;¬ù</p>
<p>I was recently invited to the LG Silicon Valley Lab to take a look at the company's OLED TVs, the 55EC9300 in particular. At the end of the event I became certain the future of TV is OLED. LG compared its OLED TV to a competitor's 4K UHD LCD TV and it could not compete; OLED was superior, hands down.</p>
<p>I was impressed by many things, but I'd like to point out one in particular: the OLED display had little to no brightness/color shifts at wide viewing angles. LG showed snippets of <em>The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug</em>. Bilbo Baggins was in Erebor, the Lonely Mountain, where all of the Dwarf kingdom's treasures are, much of it gold. I was in the sweet spot of the LCD TV and then moved to the side; gold turned into silver. I'm exaggerating a bit here, but the color shift was terrible on the LCD TV. On the 55EC9300 gold remained gold.</p>
<p>The 55EC9300 was pure eye candy. Price: US$3,499 at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KZER5GS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00KZER5GS&linkCode=as2&tag=displ0f-20&linkId=A2RSL6RZEWJ34NTY">Amazon</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=displ0f-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00KZER5GS" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.</p>
