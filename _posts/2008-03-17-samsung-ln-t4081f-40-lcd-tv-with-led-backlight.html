<p>Samsung's LN-T4081F uses a LED backlight instead of the typical CCFL backlight. Now simply using LED instead of CCFL doesn't do much in terms of performance. So Samsung developed a technology called LED Motion Plus and LED SmartLighting. LED Motion Plus progressively scans (from line 1 to line 1080) at very high frequencies resulting in elimination of motion blur. Motion blur is something that a lot of LCD TVs have problems with. Another way to reduce or eliminate motion blur is to use 120Hz frequencies. The LN-T4081F doesn't use 120Hz but instead uses a LED backlight and LED Motion Plus. The LED SmartLighting feature enhances contrast ratio by controlling the brightness of areas of the picture based on how dark or bright they are, making dark colors darker and bright areas brighter. That's how Samsung's LN-T4081F gets a contrast ratio of 500,00:1! LED backlighting is the future but it's going to cost you with a MSRP of $2499.99 for the LN-T4081F. A 42" LCD TV with almost all of the features but with the typical CCFL backlight will cost you just 50% of that.</p>
