<blockquote><p>A simple gesture would decrease the wear and tear of the hardware button, and also speed up the usage of the multitasking drawer. You simply start dragging from outside the bottom of the screen and move your finger onto the screen. This edge swipe would activate the multitasking drawer.</blockquote></p>
<p>You swipe down from the top edge to reveal notifications; do the same from the bottom and you get the multitasking drawer. Brilliant.</p>
