<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/02/post-pc-has-nothing-to-do-with-windows/">MG Siegler</a>, TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m writing this on my laptop (a MacBook Air), but I really just want to be browsing the web on my iPad right now. So I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m ending this post to go do that. Within the next five years, I bet most of you reading this will also have this desire &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; even if you think you won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t.</blockquote></p>
<p>Shift-command-r. Those three keys are what I press when I want to read an article online. Most sites, including TechCrunch, have an incredible amount of crap hovering around what I want to read. Let's check out just how much.</p>
<p>First, the big ugly TC. Then a whole bunch of links: home, startups, mobile, gadgets, social, TCTV, more. And on another menu: hot topics, Apple, Google, Facebook, Kickstarter, deadpool, ultrabook, Chromebooks, disrupt SF, and the letters Cru with the rest cut off.</p>
<p>There are <em>four</em> of those irritating social buttons with a whole bunch of meaningless numbers attached to them. Is 110 Facebook likes a lot? 46 Google +1s? Who really gives. I'm told there are 60 comments. Once on the row of irritating social buttons and then once again right before the article starts.</p>
<p>Then there's this big box on the right that brags 275,264 people like TechCrunch. That's great.</p>
<p>Below that big box of brag are more crap: popular posts, crunch board, events. At the bottom of the article is this thing called crunchbase. Then a sponsored ad. I don't have to see it thanks to AdBlock.</p>
<p>Next are comments. Some are good; most are terrible and a waste of time. After that are two more sponsored ads and then three lists: latest on Tech Crunch TV, latest in gadgets, also on AOL Tech.</p>
<p>Finally there are two rows on the bottom. One row: about & staff, advertise, jobs, events, Europe, France, Japan, contact, RSS, email, Twitter, Facebook. The final row: AOL Tech, privacy policy, copyright, and a plug for WordPress.com VIP.</p>
<p>Shift-command-r on my MacBook Pro zaps <em>all</em> of this. If the iPad doesn't have a button that exterminates all this crap, then I think Siegler is wrong. I wouldn't want to read his articles or anyone else's off an iPad if that means I'll be bombarded with worthless hovering crap as I read.</p>
