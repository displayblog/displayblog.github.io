<p><a href="http://gizmodo.com/5021269/touchscreen-blackberry-thunder-is-blackberry-9500-has-higher-res-screen-than-iphone">Gizmodo</a>: Not much is known about this mystery <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=blackberry">BlackBerry</a> device. From the looks of it, and I mean that literally, the BlackBerry 9500 aka Thunder seems to be aiming squarly at Apple's iPhone. Apple has been eating away at RIM's <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=smartphone">smartphone</a> market share and I don't think RIM likes that too much. The BlackBerry Thunder, if the rumor is correct, should beat out the iPhone in one respect: number of pixels. The Thunder's got 360x480 while the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=iphone">iPhone</a> has a pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=320-x-480">320x480</a>. That's 40 extra vertical pixels.</p>
