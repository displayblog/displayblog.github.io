<p>Cryptic names. I'm not privy to them. Nokia has outed some new smartphones at Nokia World 2010: C6, C7, E7. The C6, or C6-01 to be more precise, is a budget phone made of recycled metal and an AMOLED display, the ClearBlack variety. The C7 is the sexy one and also sports a ClearBlack AMOLED display running Symbian^3. OLED displays have never had problems with black so the ClearBlack sub-brand is somewhat of a mystery.</p>
<p>The E7 (E7-00) is the powerhouse and makes use of a 4-inch ClearBlack AMOLED display and features a QWERTY keyboard, a very good one according to <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/14/nokia-e7-first-hands-on/">Engadget</a>. But it takes two firm thumbs on the bottom pushing up the massive display to reveal the full QWERTY. The 4-inch AMOLED packs 640x360 pixels. I am not certain the pixels are of the RGB kind or of the PenTile Matrix variety. From the lower pixel density compared to the Samsung Mobile Display (SMD) 800x480 PenTile Matrix AMOLED, I am guessing that Nokia is sourcing these AMOLED displays from a different vendor.</p>
<p>Other E7 specs: WiFi BGN, HSDPA (10.2/2.0Mbps), Bluetooth 3.0, HDMI, Micro USB 2.0. One very interesting feature is the automatic switching between WCDMA and GSM bands. Flash Lite 4 is on tap. The E7 sports a 8MP camera with dual LED flash and a front-facing VGA (640x480) camera. No HDR though. 720/25p HD video can be captured in H.264 MPEG4 and the specs mention 16:9, so I'm guessing 1280x720, but not sure.</p>
<p>The one potentially very big issue: the touch sensitivity, or the lack of, on these new Nokia smartphones.</p>
