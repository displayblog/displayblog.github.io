  The 'autostereoscopic' part of the description means that depth perception is achieved
  without the use of special (and geeky) glasses. Now, there is one major challenge.
  1080p LCD TVs are great but where do you get content? There is not much 1080p content
  out there: <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=blu-ray\">Blu-ray</a>
  and over-the-air HDTV. Of course you can up convert lower-rez video content. But
  the extra money that was spent become somewhat wasted. The problem is even more
  sever for something as crazy as Philips' 56\" Quad 3D HD TV. "

<p>There is almost no content out there. Philips has a solution: 3D WoW Technology. 3D WoW transforms regular HD programming into 3D. But the best way to generate 3D content is to get 3D video camcorders out there. Viewing angles are great at 160/160. Most 3D TVs have very limited viewing angles and can be an eyesore. In addition, Philips is promising 46 views at once, which is x23 better than your regular 3D video content. Stereoscopic technology uses the slight difference in what the left and right eyes see to generate 3D perception. For about US$25,000 the 56" Quad 3D HD TV is yours, but Philips will be selling to only businesses first.</p>
