<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/18/2569109/barnes-noble-nook-tablet-review">Joanna Stern, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t missing is a beautiful 7-inch 1024 x 600 IPS display. The panel is the same as the one on the Color, but again I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t blame B&N for not messing with a good thing. The "VividView" treatment does achieve its mission of reducing glare, but what&acirc;&euro;&trade;s extremely noticeable is how superb the viewing angles are. In a side by side comparison with the Fire, not only was the Tablet&acirc;&euro;&trade;s display brighter &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; with blacks and dark blues looking even deeper &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; but I could see everything on the Tablet&acirc;&euro;&trade;s display when looking at the screen at a 90 degree angle, while the Fire&acirc;&euro;&trade;s colors started to fade at that view. That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not to say the Fire doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have a good display, I just found the Nook&acirc;&euro;&trade;s to be a smidgen better.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/11/14/topolsky-fire">John Gruber loves The Verge's video reviews</a> so I started watching the one for the Nook Tablet. Man, Stern should breath. I felt a sense of suffocation, as I often do when listening to someone talk endlessly as if in a quest to spew out as many words in a single breath. So I had to stop in the middle.</p>
<p>Getting back on topic, the Nook Tablet seems to have a better 7-inch IPS than the Kindle Fire. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/11/15/amazon-kindle-fire-ld070ws2-sl05/">The Kindle Fire uses the LG Display manufactured LD070WS2-SL05</a> and from what I've found viewing angles are slightly less than what you would expect from an IPS LCD panel: 170/170. Usually you get 178/178. Amazon cut some corners on the Kindle Fire while Barnes & Noble went quality with a better display.</p>
