<p><a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/newsroom/contents/62819">LG</a>: The LG 55EM9700 better known as LG's 55-inch OLED TV is available for pre-order, in South Korea. Deliveries are scheduled for February.</p>
<p>LG's OLED TV is different than Samsung's OLED TV in that it sports "WRGB OLED" technology. I call it <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2012/01/09/woled/">WOLED</a> and it uses four white OLED subpixels covered by RGBW color filters on top. Not as true as Samsung's RGB OLED, but probably easier and less expensive to make. Priced at &#8361;11 million or about US$10,000.</p>
