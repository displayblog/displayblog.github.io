<p>The first <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/#video-ad">iPhone 4 TV ad</a> started airing in the US just yesterday on the 27th. A longer version was shown during Steve Jobs' keynote at WWDC 2010, which I later watched online. The ad centered around the iPhone 4's FaceTime feature deeply resonated with me as I am sure it will with you.</p>
<p>PS: You can download all of Steve Jobs' keynote on iTunes by subscribing to the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/apple-keynotes/id275834665">Apple's Keynotes</a> podcast.</p>
