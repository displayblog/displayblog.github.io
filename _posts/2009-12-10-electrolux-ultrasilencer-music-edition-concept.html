<p>I plug my ears and listen to music from my iPhone when I vacuum. That's because the Animal from Dyson is <em>very</em> loud. But do I want my vacuum to be silent? I'm not sure. I think automobiles are similar. I like the roar of an engine: some convey animal-like strength and power while others signal technological prowess. I'm personally not a fan of hybrid cars that move along without a sound.</p>
<p>Back to vacuums. Although I associate sound with power it's not quite as linear as it is with vacuums. I would like them to be less loud but I wouldn't want the sound to disappear altogether.</p>
<p>But it seems Electrolux doesn't see it the way I do. The company has introduced a vacuum called UltraSilencer. According to the company it is very quiet. Electrolux has even gone a step ahead and developed a UltraSilencer Music Edition: you can listen to music coming straight out of its stereo speakers via your <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=ipod&amp;sa=Search#1348">iPod</a> taking a ride in the Music Edition's built-in dock. Electrolux has conducted a study showing we do a better job vacuuming while listening to music, with proof: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjHIqZ1l44I&amp;feature=player_embedded">a video</a>. The findings?</p>
<ul>
<li>Hip movements.</li>
<li>More calories burned.</li>
<li>Hard rock got the job done faster.</li>
<li>Jazz made people more thorough.</li><br />
</ul><br />
If your husband does the vacuuming and you've been wanting him to lose some weight and do a better job at vacuuming, I'm sure this is music to your ears. And if you happen to have kids, the UltraSilencer sans music is "sleeping kids-compatible".
