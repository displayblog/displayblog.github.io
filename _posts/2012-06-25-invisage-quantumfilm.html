<p><a href="http://www.invisage.com/page.aspx?cont=QuantumFilm%20Technology">InVisage</a>: QuantumFilm is made with quantum dots, which are semiconductors that capture light. Light sensitivity is quadrupled and light fill factor is improved from 60% to 100% by coating the image sensor wafer with QuantumFilm. Higher pixel count and higher light sensitivity can go hand in hand. Checkout <a href="http://youtu.be/8KFpsFpc-ww">the YouTube video</a> for a jargon-free explanation of how QuantumFilm works.</p>
