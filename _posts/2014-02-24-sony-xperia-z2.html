<p>The Sony Xperia Z2 sports a new 5.2-inch 1920x1080 Triluminos IPS LCD with Live Color LED, which gives the Z2 the widest color gamut on a mobile device.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/24/5438652/sony-xperia-z2-specs-features-and-release-date">Vlad Savov, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When viewed in person, the Z2 does indeed have a very attractive display, with good contrast and color fidelity, immediately distinguishing it from the mediocre screen of the Z1.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/02/19/sony-xperia-z1s/">Just a few days I was wondering why Sony, a company so good at manipulating pixels on the big screen, is so bad at it on mobile displays</a>. I guess Sony got its act together with the Xperia Z2.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.sonymobile.com/press_release/xperia-z2-best-camera-camcorder-in-waterproof-smartphone/">Sony</a>: The camera subsystem seems to be quite capable too: 20.7 megapixel 1/2.3 Exmor RS CMOS image sensor, G Lens, BIONZ image processing engine, and 4K (3840x2160/30p) video capture capability.</p>
