<p><a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1358968&amp;highlight=">Amazon</a>: During the last six months Amazon has been on a firmware development program for the Kindle. The result of that program is an 85% improvement in battery life: up to seven days (from just four days) with wireless on. The Kindle also gets native PDF support now; no more converting PDF documents.</p>
