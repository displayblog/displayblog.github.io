<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/apple-america-and-a-squeezed-middle-class.html?_r=3&pagewanted=all">Charles Duhigg and Keith Bradsher, The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2007, a little over a month before the iPhone was scheduled to appear in stores, Mr. Jobs beckoned a handful of lieutenants into an office. For weeks, he had been carrying a prototype of the device in his pocket.</p>
<p>Mr. Jobs angrily held up his iPhone, angling it so everyone could see the dozens of tiny scratches marring its plastic screen, according to someone who attended the meeting. He then pulled his keys from his jeans.</p>
<p>People will carry this phone in their pocket, he said. People also carry their keys in their pocket. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;I won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t sell a product that gets scratched,&acirc;&euro; he said tensely. The only solution was using unscratchable glass instead. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;I want a glass screen, and I want it perfect in six weeks.&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>After one executive left that meeting, he booked a flight to Shenzhen, China. If Mr. Jobs wanted perfect, there was nowhere else to go.</blockquote></p>
<p>I must assume then that <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/12/27/walter-isaacson-steve-jobs/">the meeting between Steve Jobs and Corning CEO Wendell Weeks</a> happened soon thereafter:</p>
<blockquote><p>Steve Jobs when he does the iPhone decides he doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t want plastic, he wants really tough glass on it, and they don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t make a glass that can be tough like they want. And finally somebody says to him, because they were making all of the glass in China for the fronts of the stores, says, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;You ought to check with the people at Corning. They&acirc;&euro;&trade;re kind of smart there.&acirc;&euro; So, he flies to Corning, New York, sits there in front of the CEO, Wendell Weeks, and says, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;This is what I want, a glass that can do this.&acirc;&euro; So, Wendell Weeks says, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;We once created a type of process that created something called Gorilla Glass.&acirc;&euro; And Steve said, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;No, no, no. Here&acirc;&euro;&trade;s how you make really strong glass.&acirc;&euro; And Wendell says, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Wait a minute, I know how to make glass. Shut up and listen to me.&acirc;&euro; And Steve, to his credit, shuts up and listens, and Wendell Weeks describes a process that makes Gorilla Glass. And Steve then says, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Fine. In six months I want enough of it to make&acirc;&euro;&ldquo;whatever it is&acirc;&euro;&ldquo;a million iPhones.&acirc;&euro; And Wendell says, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m sorry, we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve actually never made it. We don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have a factory to make it. This was a process we developed, but we never had a manufacturing plant to do it.&acirc;&euro; And Steve looks at him and says what he said to Woz, 20, 30 years earlier: &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be afraid, you can do it.&acirc;&euro; Wendell Weeks tells me&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; Because I flew to Corning, because I just wanted to hear this story. Wendell Weeks tells me, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;I just sat there and looked at the guy. He kept saying, &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be afraid. You can do this.&acirc;&euro;&trade;&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>Wendell Weeks said he called his plant in Kentucky that was making glass for LCD screens, and said, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Start the process now, and make Gorilla Glass.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>And the Gorilla Glass got shipped to Shenzhen, China to be integrated into the iPhone. The rest is history.</p>
<p><em>Update: </em> I missed this part of the article I quoted at the beginning of this post. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/apple-america-and-a-squeezed-middle-class.html">Charles Duhigg and Keith Bradsher, The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple had redesigned the iPhone&acirc;&euro;&trade;s screen at the last minute, forcing an assembly line overhaul. New screens began arriving at the plant near midnight.</p>
<p>A foreman immediately roused 8,000 workers inside the company&acirc;&euro;&trade;s dormitories, according to the executive. Each employee was given a biscuit and a cup of tea, guided to a workstation and within half an hour started a 12-hour shift fitting glass screens into beveled frames. Within 96 hours, the plant was producing over 10,000 iPhones a day.</blockquote></p>
