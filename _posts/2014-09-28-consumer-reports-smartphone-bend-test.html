<p><a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2014/09/consumer-reports-tests-iphone-6-bendgate/index.htm">Consumer Reports</a>: At what force do smartphones deform? Here are the answers (in pounds):</p>
<ul>
<li>HTC One (M8): 70</li>
<li>Apple iPhone 6: 70</li>
<li>Apple iPhone 6 Plus: 90</li>
<li>LG G3: 130</li>
<li>Apple iPhone 5: 130</li>
<li>Samsung Galaxy Note 3: 150</li><br />
</ul><br />
<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/09/13/tim-cook-making-a-better-phone-in-every-single-way/">In his interview with Charlie Rose, Tim Cook boasted</a>, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s never been about just making a larger phone... it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s been about making a better phone in every single way.&acirc;&euro;¬ù I realize heads of companies exaggerate, bend the truth a little, in the name of marketing. I also realize I am being a bit picky, but the Consumer Reports bend test shows the iPhone 5&Acirc;&nbsp;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo; I assume the iPhone 5s will have similar results &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; can withstand up to almost twice as much force than the iPhone 6 before it deforms. I do not think anyone would consider that better.</p>
<p>Read <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/09/25/the-blind-pursuit-of-thinness/">The Blind Pursuit Of Thinness</a> for more of my thoughts on why it was a mistake to make the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus so thin.</p>
