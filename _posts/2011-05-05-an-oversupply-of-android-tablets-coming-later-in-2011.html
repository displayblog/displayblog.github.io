<blockquote><p>Non-Apple tablet PC players are at high risk of facing excess tablet PC inventory in the second half of 2011 as first-tier smartphone and notebook vendors as well as second-tier vendors are all ready to enter the tablet PC competition with their devices, according to market watchers.</blockquote></p>
<p>Oversupply said another way is underwhelming demand. But an oversupply of Android tablets later in 2011 might be a blessing in disguise. A dozen brands will be hawking their Android tablets all vying for your hard-earned dollars. The easiest and most effective way that computer or CE brands have competed in the past is to lower prices, dramatically. Profits be damned! And I expect prices to be incredibly low, so low you can't not buy it. How can you resist a US$99 Android tablet? It doesn't matter that you can't pronounce the brand, the Android tablet is just $99! I'm sure Android tablet unit sales will blow the socks off the iPad franchise this year.</p>
