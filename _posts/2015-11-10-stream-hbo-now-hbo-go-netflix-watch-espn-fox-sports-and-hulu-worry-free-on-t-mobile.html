<p>[ <a href="http://recode.net/2015/11/10/t-mobile-announces-free-video-streaming/">re/code</a> ] Dawn Chmielewski:</p>
<blockquote><p>Subscribers can choose among popular streaming services including Netflix, HBO Now, HBO Go, Watch ESPN, Fox Sports and Hulu.</p>
<p>Notable omissions from the list include YouTube, the world&rsquo;s biggest video site, and Facebook and Snapchat, both of which have made big pushes into video in the last year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Video streams free,&rdquo; T-Mobile CEO John Legere said Tuesday. &ldquo;Binge on. Start watching your shows, stop watching your data.&rdquo; Legere&rsquo;s offer applies to customers who pay for at least three gigabytes of data a month.</blockquote><br />
This is cool.</p>
<blockquote><p>Video is, of course, one of the biggest gobblers of data. To make it feasible to offer unlimited streaming, T-Mobile is ratcheting down the quality of video to something it says approaches &ldquo;DVD quality&rdquo; but is less than the HD feeds some users are accustomed to. In addition, those taking part in the Binge On program will see other videos reduced in quality &mdash; not just those that are part of participating services.</blockquote><br />
I'm guessing almost everyone on T-Mobile would rather watch unlimited 480p videos than watch limited HD&nbsp;videos.</p>
<p>Thankfully, for unlimited data customers such as myself and others who value quality over quantity, you can disable Binge On. Starts November 15.</p>
