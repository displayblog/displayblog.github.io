<p><a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/consumer/detail/detail.do?group=computersperipherals&amp;type=monitors&amp;subtype=lcd&amp;model_cd=LS24TDNSUV/ZA">Samsung</a>: The Samsung T240HD has it all. Almost. With a large 24-inch TFT LCD sporting a pixel format of 1920x1200, you'll have plenty of LCD space to do some serious work as well as play. The 10,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio should be good enough for generate some seriously fantastic images while fragging someone or just watching a good Blu-ray flick via one of three HDMI connections. And the 5ms response time, although not the fastest in the world, should keep up with your twitch-based play. The brightness of 300 cd/m2 is standard. And you get the nice Touch of Color design. All of this sounds great. Except for one thing.</p>
<p>If you look closely at the specifications above, you'll see that the viewing angles are at 160/160. Do you know what that tells me? TN. Twisted Nematic. Low tech but that's why the T240HD won't be <em>that</em> expensive. One of the benefits of a TN LCD panel is that it generally has a faster response time. So if all you do is sit right in the center of the screen and don't need to move your head, the limitations of the viewing angles might not be such a deal buster. If you need good viewing angles (and overall color fidelity) you'll need to find something else, perhaps a monitor with IPS, MVA, ASV or PVA. But if you want a fairly affordable 24" LCD monitor with TV capabilities to boot, the T240HD is one of the few options out there.</p>
