<a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/01/20/bumptop">John Gruber at Daring Fireball</a> had this to say about <a href="http://bumptop.com/mac/">BumpTop for Mac</a>, available now for US$29:</p>
<blockquote><p>... I don't just want better file management for my <em>desktop</em>. I want better file management everywhere. BumpTop is a Finder alternative that only handles one folder: <em>~/Desktop/</em>. And the 3D stuff, with a weird perspective on "walls", just seems silly.</blockquote><br />
Still worth a look according to Gruber if you're swamped with files and folders on your desktop.</p>
