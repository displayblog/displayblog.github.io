<p>Brian Chen at <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/11/making-windows-phone-7/all/1">Wired</a> tells the story of Microsoft's reboot of its mobile OS:</p>
<blockquote><p>The old MO with Windows Mobile was to modify skins of the OS in compliance with a manufacturer&acirc;&euro;&trade;s set of instructions. The new plan for Windows Phone 7 would be to design the operating system around customer enjoyment, similar to Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s approach.</blockquote></p>
<p>A focus on typography:</p>
<blockquote><p>... instead of a screen cluttered with icon buttons, Windows Phone 7 focuses heavily on typography to display different features and functions.</blockquote></p>
<p>Metro is a very different approach compared to Apple's iOS. It seems more elegant in some ways and it probably stems from Microsoft's elegant use of beautiful typography.</p>
<p>Apple's immediate future with its next major OS X release will incorporate some UI elements from iOS. I am excited at the possibility that Microsoft might follow a similar strategy and fuze Metro UI elements into the next Windows version.</p>
<p>Right now if I could pick and choose, I would want my Retina Display-equipped iPhone 4 running WP7. The Retina Display is by far the best mobile screen on the planet. Samsung's Super AMOLED looks to be a near-perfect match with so much black in Metro, but it wouldn't do well because its weakness is in rendering clear text.</p>
<p>The only thing that doesn't sit perfectly well with me is WP7's front screen: the solid colored blocks are unnecessary. Make them transparent to the background.</p>
