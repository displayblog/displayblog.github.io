<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20110414PD216.html">DigiTimes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>AU Optronics (AUO) will begin volume production of dead-zone free 3D display panels in the third quarter of 2011, with some 15.6-inch notebook models built with the new 3D panels to hit the market in the quarter, according to the company.</p>
<p>AUO's dead-zone free 3D panels incorporate switchable lens technology and face-tracking to overcome the dead-zone problem when viewing the 3D display using the naked eye, the company said in a technology seminar.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Bang & Olufsen (B&O) BeoVision 7 swivels using a motorized stand. Combine that with AUO's face-tracking display and you'll be faced with a dead-zone free 3D TV all day and all night. Just make sure you get your eyes checked by an optometrist a lot more than just once a year.</p>
