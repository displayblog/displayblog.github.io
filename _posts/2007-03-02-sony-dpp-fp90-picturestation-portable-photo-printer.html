<p>Sony introduced its DPP-FP90 PictureStation during PMA07. The portable photo printer has a built-in carrying handle and prints pictures in less than 60 seconds. The DPP-FP90 has editing capabilities builit-in and has a one-button print process. The Auto Touch-up feature automatically corrects common picture elements such as exposure, focus and red-eye. Sony states that the portable printer "brings the photo lab to you..." and is designed to "complement the [digital] camera's ability to capture and share memories in the moment."</p>

<p>The DPP-FP90 has a 3.6" LCD screen for previewing and editing pictures. The LCD tilts too. The unit can take CF, SD and Memory Stick Duo Pro flash memory cards and claims a quick 45 second printout of a 4 x 6 print from a Memory Stick.</p>
<p>When I read about this, I thought for a second on how photos are taken to "capture the moment". It is usually a quick snapshot. After showing the digital picture, the people move on and continue whatever it was they were doing. So I tried to imagine someone busting out one of these photo printers and announcing to everyone, "Wait! Let me print out a copy for you!" 45 seconds might not be such a long time, but I'm not sure if this is what the folks that take snapshots are looking for. On the other hand, I can see this work brilliantly for a child's birthday party. Imagine the smiles when all the 5 year-olds receive a copy of the picture that was just taken!</p>
