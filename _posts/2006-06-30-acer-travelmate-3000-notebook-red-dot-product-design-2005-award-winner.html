<p>One of the greatest products combine excellent design geared toward ease of use, with a simple elegance that is pleasing to the eye and combining that with great technology. The Acer TravelMate 3000 weighs only 1.4kg (a little more than 3lbs), is 25mm thin (a little less than an inch), and the batteries last 4 1/2 hours. The 3000 has a 12.1" wide TFT LCD with 1280 x 800 resolution. Connectivity includes an Ethernet port, WiFi, PAN, modem and optical (FIR). A nice touch is the units non-slip carry grip. Many of the sexy designs slip right out of your grip and I'm glad to see Acer make the design work with how it will be used.</p>
<p>If I had it my way, I would use a non-existent 1680 x 1050 resolution 12.1" wide TFT LCD that is not glossy. I would shrink down the thickness a bit more to say 0.8lbs and make it weigh about 2lbs. I would also make the battery last around 7 hours, if possible. I wonder if there is an operating system that is completely resolution independent...</p>
