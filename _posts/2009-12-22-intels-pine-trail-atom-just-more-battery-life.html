<p>Reviews are out. Intel's new Pine Trail Atom CPU is nothing more than more battery life compared to previous Atoms. The integrated GPU is no good. Performance-wise the prior generation N330 is much faster. So, if all you want is better battery life without having to add bulky high-capacity batteries, make sure to get a netbook with the new Pine Trail Atom CPU from Intel. If you're looking to boost performance, stick with the older N330. And finally, if you want to watch HD video make sure to get one with NVIDIA's Ion or Broadcom's Crystal HD (BCM70015).
