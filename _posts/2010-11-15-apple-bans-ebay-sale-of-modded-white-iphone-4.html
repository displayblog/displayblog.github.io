<blockquote><p>Apparently, the owner of a 16GB iPhone 4 recently decided to sell his device in order to buy a Motrola Droid. Advised that the best way to get more money for his phone was to convert it to a white model through iFixDirect, he laid out $179.99 for the color conversion and then put the device up on eBay, stating the caveat that it was a modded device and not, say, a leaked prototype.</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple claimed that this was a counterfeit product that infringed the company's rights. eBay pulled the modded white iPhone 4. Ridiculous.</p>
<p>If you want to change the color of your iPhone 4 and then sell it I don't think it's anybody else's business. Butt out Apple. Unless you've got a white iPhone 4 to sell. If you want a white iPhone 4 and want to mod it yourself hop on over to <a href="http://www.ifixdirect.com/products/iphone-4-color-swap">iFix Direct</a>. It is a little pricy at US$179.99 but you will be one of only a very few. For even more you can change the color of your iPhone to almost anything your heart desires as long as the front cover (sans button) is black.
