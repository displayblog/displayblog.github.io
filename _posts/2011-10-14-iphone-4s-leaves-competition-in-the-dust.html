<blockquote><p>Look, this isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t about speeds and feeds, but Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s knack for creating tightly integrated experiences really starts to shine with the latest iPhone. [...] But it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s tight interplay between the hardware and software &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; both from a single company and designed under the same roof &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; that enables Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s phone to leave higher-specc&acirc;&euro;&trade;d devices in the dust.</blockquote></p>
<p>One of those is the Samsung Galaxy S II.</p>
