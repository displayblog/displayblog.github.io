The good folks at iFixit took a brand new <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22zune+hd%22&amp;sa=Search#1348">Zune HD</a> and had a close look inside. There are many pictures in the teardown but I will share with one of a few that really interest me as a display geek. The picture showing NVIDIA's Tegra processor shows that it was manufactured in Korea. You can also see that the Zune HD, like almost everything else electronic, was assembled in China.

One major feature of the Zune HD is its ability to output 720p HD video via the HDMI connection. In addition to incorporating Tegra, there are many other technologies that makes me think Microsoft may have jumped passed the hardware capabilities of the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22ipod+touch%22&amp;sa=Search#1348">iPod touch</a>. By a mile.</p></p>
