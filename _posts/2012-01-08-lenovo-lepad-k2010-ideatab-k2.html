<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/1/8/2692444/lenovo-s2-10-inch-tablet-wth-android-4-0-hands-on-pictures">The Verge</a>: The Lenovo LePad K2010 / IdeaTab K2 is a 10.1-inch Ice Cream Sandwich tablet with a 1920x1200 IPS LCD, which I believe is a first. IPS is a solid start and add to that a resolution of 224 ppi. It falls short of "Retina", but is nonetheless impressive.</p>
