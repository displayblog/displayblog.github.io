<p><a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/10/26/early-bird-showdown-barnes-noble-nook-color-vs-amazon-kindle/">CrunchGear</a> on the B&N Nook Color:</p>
<blockquote><p>A black-and-white display is fine when you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re reading text-heavy books. You know, histories, biographies, novels, etc. Maybe if you have children and you want an e-reading device a color screen would be worth something to you. You can read Dracula just fine in paperback form, or in black-and-white e-book form. The same probably can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be said about all those Dr. Seuss books: color is huge there.</blockquote></p>
<p>It's not just about color in books: magazines and newspapers are included too. Color can be essential in even text-heavy books like textbooks.</p>
