<p>LED-based backlighting seems like the wave of the future for DLP. Samsung came out with a LED-backlit DLP (<a href="http://displayblog.wordpress.com/2006/07/17/samsung-hl-s5679w-dlp-with-led/">HL-S5679W</a>) first NuVision intends to be the second. It's 52LEDLP is a 52" DLP with a LED backlight and will be available in September for $4400. The 52LEDLP will be a Full HD unit with 1920 x 1080 resolution allowing 1080p content when it becomes available in PlayStation 3, Blu-Ray and HD-DVD formats.</p>
<p>The 52LEDLP will be showcased during the 2006 CEDIA Expo that will be held in Denver from September 17 to 17 at the Colorado Convention Center. Luminus Devices' PhlatLight LED backlight is used but incorporates NuVision's specialized electronics to optimize signal processing systems. The PhlatLight LED backlight is free of Mercury and other hazardous materials. The 52LEDLP unit will have 500 cd/m2 of brightness, 5000:1 contrast ratio, will use TI's xHD4 DLP chip, has two HDMI/HDCP inputs, and other goodies.</p>
