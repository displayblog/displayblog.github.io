<blockquote><p>Compal Electronics has announced revenues of NT$66.42 billion (US$2.29 billion) for March 2011, up 52.4% sequentially but down 12.3% on year. For the first quarter, revenues topped NT$162.86 billion, decreasing 24.8% from a year earlier, according to a company filing with the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TSE).</p>
<p>Compal's March notebook shipments reached 4.3 million units, a gain of 59.3% from 2.7 million units shipped in February, the Chinese-language United Evening News said in an April 11 report.</p>
<p>Compal shipped a total of 10.4 million notebooks in the first quarter compared to 13.1 million units shipped by Quanta Computer during the same period, the paper added.</blockquote></p>
<p>March was a turning point in an otherwise disappointing first quarter for Compal. The average selling price for notebooks in the month of March was about NT$15,447 (US$534). For the first quarter it was approximately NT$15,660 (US$541). Notebook ASPs will continue to decline and will need to, to compete against a surge in demand for tablets thanks to the popular iPad 2 by Apple.</p>
