<p>Matthew Francis, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/12/holey-metal-batman-extraordinary-optics-make-it-appear-transparent/">Ars Technica</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Take a very thin sheet of metal and drill it with tiny holes in a regular rectangular pattern. Ordinarily, if you shine light with wavelength that is larger than the holes, it wouldn't get through&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the metal would be opaque. However, in the case of this particular pattern of holes, a lot of the light gets through the sheet anyway, a phenomenon known as extraordinary optical tranmission (EOT).</blockquote></p>
