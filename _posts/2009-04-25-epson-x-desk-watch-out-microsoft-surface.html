<strong><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?s=epson">Epson</a> is to Microsoft as X-Desk is to <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?s=microsoft+surface">Surface</a></strong> Epson has introduced a Surface-like table called the X-Desk. It is a multitouch table that uses rear projection technology and infrared sensors to interact with your fingers and real objects such as mobile phones.</p>
<p><strong>Retail Focus</strong> Epson is gearing the X-Desk for retail applications. For instance, AT&amp;T could use it to compare features of different mobile phones. I could also see this in the homes of the rich: kids come up to it, put their smartphones on it, and start messing around with their pictures. I'm assuming the X-Desk will be expensive.</p>
<p><strong>X-Desk App Store</strong> I have an idea Epson. Create a developer community by opening the APIs on the X-Desk. Then create an Xapp Store. Have the X-Desk automatically connect to the Xapp Store to download cool apps. Sounds cool? I can test it out for you.</p>
