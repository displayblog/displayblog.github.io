  Rover just announced its 2010 Range Rover at the New York Auto Show. The new Range
  Rover can be equipped with two engines: 5.0-liter V8 supercharged pumping out 510bhp
  and 461lb/ft of torque or the naturally aspirated version good for 375bhp and
  375lb/ft of torque. Compared to the outgoing model the new Range Rover has new
  headlamps, a new grille, a refreshed bumper cap, relocated fog lamps, three-section
  fender vents, three-stripe LED side indicators, and new three-stripe LED taillamps.
  But there is something more interesting, at least to me, <em>inside</em> of
  the new Range Rover. "

<p><strong>12" TFT LCD Virtual Gauge Cluster</strong> Instead of the traditional analog needle instrument panel the new 2010 Range Rover sports a 12" TFT LCD, similar to what the current S-Class has. Everything you see in the picture is virtual. And that means the look and feel can be infinitely customizable. Land Rover's Nick Rogers, Chief Engineer, New Vehicle Architecture puts it this way: "The new display technology used by the 2010 Range Rover is a major advance. It gives us tremendous flexibility in presenting information, so that the driver gets precisely the data they require, in all driving conditions." Cool.</p>
