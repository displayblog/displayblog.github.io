<a href="http://www.ruggedpcreview.com/3_slates_panasonic_cf08.html">Rugged PC Review</a>: The Panasonic ToughBook CF-08 is, as the name suggests, tough. It can withstand a 1.2 meter fall. The CF-08 is designed to be used via Citrix ICA or Microsoft RDP as a terminal server with either a ToughBook or a Windows server. The 10.4" is not only touch-capable, it is also readable in sunlight, a technology known as transflective LCD where the LCD has both transmissive and reflective properties. The all-magnesium case allows the CF-08 to be tough but also light. The CF-08 is sealed to IP54 specifications and has obtained other MIL-STD requirements.</p>
