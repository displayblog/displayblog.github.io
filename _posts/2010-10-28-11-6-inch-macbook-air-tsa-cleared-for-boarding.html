<p><a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2010-10-26/tech/macbook.airport_1_macbook-air-tsa-new-laptop?_s=PM:TECH">CNN</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Frequent travelers may appreciate the convenience of the 11-inch MacBook Air, which can remain in a passenger's bag when going through airport security, a Transportation Security Administration spokesman told CNN.</blockquote></p>
<p>But the only thing we can expect the TSA to be is being "consistently inconsistent". Here's a suggestion from Darren Murph at <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/28/11-6-inch-macbook-air-cleared-to-remain-packed-through-security/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In theory, you shouldn't have to remove it from your backpack as you struggle to reach your gate, but if we had to guess, we'd say you'll be ask to take it out and re-run it if you try.</blockquote></p>
<p>Just take it out. Imagine the snickering from all the folks behind you when they realize they are being delayed because of your brand new Apple thingamajig.</p>
