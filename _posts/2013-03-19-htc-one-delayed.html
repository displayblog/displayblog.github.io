<p>Florence Ion, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/03/htc-one-delayed-by-manufacturing-snafus/">Ars Technica</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The delays can be attributed to shortages in metal casings and camera parts.</blockquote></p>
<p>Presumably the reason for these shortages is because component suppliers do not consider HTC a tier-one customer. That's too bad, if true. I think the HTC One sports one of the smartest designs on a smartphone. I also respect HTC's decision to buck the trend of adding more meaningless pixels to the image sensor and instead making the pixels bigger.</p>
