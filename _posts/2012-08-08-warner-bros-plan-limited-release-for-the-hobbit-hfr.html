<p><a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118057587.html?cmpid=RSS|News|LatestNews">David S. Cohen, Variety</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Warner Bros. is convinced that high-frame-rate movies are the next big thing -- but they're keeping the first HFR release fairly small.</p>
<p>According to source familiar with Warner's release plans for Peter Jackson's first "Hobbit," the HFR version will go out to only select locations, perhaps not even into all major cities.</blockquote></p>
<p>HFR (high frame rate) in the case of "The Hobbit" is 48 fps. I hope the HFR version comes to Silicon Valley.</p>
