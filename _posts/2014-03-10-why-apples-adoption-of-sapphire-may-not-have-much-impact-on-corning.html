<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2014/03/10/why-apples-adoption-of-sapphire-may-not-have-much-impact-on-corning/">Forbes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Using the amount for Gorilla Glass sales to Apple and the Trefis widget for Corning&acirc;&euro;&trade;s specialty materials revenue (below), we can assess the impact Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s move to sapphire will have on our stock price estimate. By reducing the specialty materials revenue by $187 million for 2014, we will be able to simulate a loss of sales when Apple stops purchasing Gorilla Glass from 2014 onward. We can see that our stock price estimate for Corning declines from $18.88 to $18.56, a decrease of $0.32.</blockquote></p>
<p>To assume Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s move to sapphire for cover glass applications will stop at Apple seems wrong; most likely all of Apple's competitors such as LG, Samsung, Sony, etc. will also shift to sapphire cover glass for their top-of-the-line smartphones. And that most likely <em>will</em> have quite a bit of an impact on Corning's Gorilla Glass business.</p>
