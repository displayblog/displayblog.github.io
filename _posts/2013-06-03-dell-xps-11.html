<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/3/4390788/dell-xps-11-video-preview-computex-2013">The Verge</a>: Combine the keyboard on the Microsoft Surface Touch Cover and the 360-degree flip-ability of the Lenovo Yoga and you almost get the 11.6-inch Dell XPS 11. What's missing are a whole bunch of pixels: 2560x1440 to be exact. The resolution is an impressive 253 ppi.</p>
