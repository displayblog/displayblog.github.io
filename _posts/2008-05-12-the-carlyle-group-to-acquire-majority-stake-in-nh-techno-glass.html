<p>The Carlyle Group plans to acquire a majority stake in NH Techno Glass (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=nht">NHT</a>), a manufacturer of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-glass">LCD glass</a> substrates. NHT is a 50-50 joint venture of HOYA Corporation and Nippon Sheet Glass Co. (NSG) and was established in 1991. NHT is headquartered in Yokohama, Japan with locations in Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea. HOYA was established in 1941 and is Japan's first specialty manufacturer of optical glass and is currently involved in electro-optics, photonics, vision care, healthcare and crystal products.</p>
<p>NSG will sell its entire stake in NHT and HOYA will sell only part of its holdings and collaborate with Carlyle in this new partnership. Carlyle will focus on facilities expansion and strategic partnerships. Carlyle will have to. NHT as a LCD glass supplier is fourth out of four. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=corning">Corning</a> (including <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=%22samsung+corning+precision%22">Samsung Corning Precision</a>, a 50-50 joint venture between <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=samsung">Samsung</a> and Corning) reigns supreme with roughly 60% of the market in terms of area shipments followed by <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=%22asahi+glass%22">Asahi Glass Co.</a> (AGC) with about 20% and then <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=%22nippon+electric+glass%22">Nippon Electric Glass</a> (NEG) with roughly 15%. That leaves NHT with about 5%.</p>
