<p>David Hsieh, VP, Greater China Market, <a href="http://www.displaysearchblog.com/2011/06/if-panel-prices-arent-increasing-will-they-fall/">DisplaySearch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Panel makers now intend to sustain panel prices at current levels (there is no room for prices to fall further as they are below costs in many cases), and then wait for the market to tighten in late Q3&acirc;&euro;&trade;11 when downstream customers will need to build inventories for the holidays. However, there is also a sense that if panel prices do not increase, then they will fall. Several people in the industry, especially from the panel buying side, have suggested that panel makers will face pressure to either reduce capacity utilization or reduce prices in order to maintain their shipments.</blockquote></p>
