<p>Joe Schneider and Robert Fenner, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-08-01/apple-patent-suit-puts-samsung-tablet-sales-in-australia-on-hold.html">Bloomberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 infringes 10 Apple patents, including the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;look and feel,&acirc;&euro;¬ù and touchscreen technology of the iPad, Steven Burley, a lawyer for Apple, told Federal Court Justice Annabelle Bennett in Sydney yesterday. The Cupertino, California-based company sought an Australian injunction and also wants to stop Samsung from selling the tablet in other countries, Burley said without specifying where.</blockquote></p>
<p>For the time being Samsung will not be advertising or selling its Galaxy Tab 10.1 in Australia. The suit was based on the US version of the Galaxy Tab 10.1, but how different is an Australian version?</p>
<p>I agree with the look of the Galaxy Tab 10.1 being similar to the iPad. But the feel? Turn it on, start playing with it, and you'll realize they're completely different.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> Samsung Australia <em>via</em> <a href="http://ausdroid.net/2011/08/02/samsung-australias-official-comment-on-apples-complaint-to-the-federal-court/">Ausdroid</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple Inc. filed a complaint with the Federal Court of Australia involving a Samsung GALAXY Tab 10.1 variant that Samsung Electronics had no plans of selling in Australia. No injunction was issued by the court and the parties in the case reached a mutual agreement which stipulates that the variant in question will not be sold in Australia.</p>
<p>A Samsung GALAXY Tab 10.1 for the Australian market will be released in the near future.</p>
<p>This undertaking does not affect any other Samsung smartphone or tablet available in the Australian market or other countries.</p>
<p>Samsung will continue to actively defend and protect our intellectual property to ensure our continued innovation and growth in the mobile communication business.</blockquote></p>
<p>Why would Apple seek an injunction of a US variant of the Galaxy Tab 10.1, in Australia? Probably because Samsung <em>did</em> plan on selling the same Galaxy Tab 10.1 there. While the lawsuit was underway it wouldn't be too difficult to change a couple of things here and there to make a variant for the Australian market. Of course this is all conjecture on my part, but I wouldn't be surprised if that's what actually happened.</p>
<p>If the Australian patent litigation system is similar to the U.S. where it upholds the importance of precedence, it will mean that this new Australian variant of the Galaxy Tab 10.1 will likely meet the same fate as the U.S. version.</p>
<p><em>Another update:</em> Samsung <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2011/08/samsung-officially-postpones-galaxy-tab-10-1-launch-event/">Gizmodo Australia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In light of the current legal proceedings by Apple Inc. against Samsung Electronics Australia, Samsung regrets to announce it will be postponing its media launch event, scheduled for 11th August 2011, for the Samsung GALAXY Tab 10.1.</p>
<p>Samsung will announce a new date for the GALAXY Tab 10.1 media launch event as soon as practicable.</blockquote></p>
<p>I was under the impression the current legal proceedings with Apple had nothing to do with the launch of the Australian variant of Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1.</p>
