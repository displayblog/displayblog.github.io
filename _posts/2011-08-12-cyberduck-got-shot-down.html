<p>Ah, my favorite FTP app: Cyberduck. Free, functional, easy on the eyes. Tonight, I'll be tossing it into the Trash. Why? It's a long story.</p></p>
<p>On August 8, I decided to go Google-free. That meant finding a way to replace Gmail, Google Reader, Google the search engine, FeedBurner, Analytics, Docs, etc. You can read more about it in <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/08/08/google-adeu/"><em>Google, Ad&Atilde;&copy;u.</em></a> The gist: I don't trust Google anymore.</p></p>
<p>For Gmail I thought it would be easy. Just use Mail. The only problem was that I had deleted Mail a while back. I deleted Mail because it was big, and pooped files all over the drive. Space was precious because I went from a 500GB HDD to a 50GB SSD. So I thought, "Heck, I'll just use Gmail using a browser." That's what I did, merrily, for a good long while and with less clutter on my Mac. But Google prompted me to change. And now I had to reinstall Mail.</p></p>
<p>Well that was going to be a problem. You see, Mail comes on a DVD. I had pulled out the Superdrive thinking I wouldn't need it. I blame Apple for making me think I didn't need an optical drive anymore. Read <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/04/26/silent-cool-green-macbook-pro/"><em>Silent, Cool, Green MacBook Pro</em></a> if you want to find out why I really did that.</p></p>
<p>After reinstalling the Superdrive, I slid in the DVD, and installed Mail. Then Snow Leopard hissed at me saying that Mail was incompatible. Incompatible. How could that be? I googled and googled but couldn't find an answer. The alternatives weren't that appealing either. Sparrow <em>looked</em> nice but to get rid of the ads it was going to cost me US$10. I didn't want to spend even more for MailMate ($40) or Postbox ($30). I've used Thunderbird and I didn't like how it looked. Eudora looked ugly too. If I was going to spend $30 or more on an email client I might as well get a brand new operating system <em>with</em> a brand new Mail. So that's what I did. Yes, I know, in <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/07/20/im-not-playing-that-game/"><em>"I'm not playing that game."</em></a> I wrote that I didn't need Lion. Well, I needed Lion now and it was a better deal than almost anything else.</p></p>
<p>I quite like Lion. Surfing with Safari without scroll bars is wonderful. Two-finger scrolling is taking a while to get used to, but I think I'm getting the hang of it. I try to think of it this way: I'm moving an actual page with my two fingers. So if I want to see what's down there, I push the page <em>up</em> with my fingers, like a real page.</p></p>
<p>Lion also kept all of my previous settings intact so there was very little to customize. I got rid of the wallpapers, some modem files, screensavers, etc., but no major customizations. I don't use LaunchPad or any of the fancy multitouch gestures. Oh, there is one: three-finger up, for Mission Control. It's pretty convenient. The only major behavioral change is the reversed scrolling.</p></p>
<p>Now, back to Cyberduck. I wanted to FTP something: <a href="http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/">PHP Markdown</a>. At first I didn't get Markdown: what it was good for, why John Gruber develop it. Then I went to <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus">Dingus</a> to check it out. Bingo! With Markdown, writing posts with a non-WYSIWYG text editor becomes a lot easier. You can actually <em>read</em> what you write and the coding is more intuitive and efficient. Here's what John Gruber has to say about <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>:</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).</p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>I'm writing this post in Markdown after a few minutes of fiddling. The learning curve isn't as steep as I thought it'd be. With PHP Markdown installed as a plugin, I type in Markdown using MarsEdit and WordPress parses it into HTML. How nice is that! (<em>Update:</em> I've decided to use the free and excellent TextWrangler and parse Markdown locally. I still get to write posts more naturally, but get away from depending on a WordPress plugin. Also having the smallest number of plugins does help with CPU cycle usages and the overall speed of DisplayBlog.)</p></p>
<p>But there was just one problem. Cyberducky needed a Java runtime. And as you may or may not know Lion doesn't come with Java. Did I want to install a huge Java runtime package just to run a tiny FTP app? Nope. Did I want to spend $34 on Transmit, what many consider the best FTP client on the Mac? Too expensive. I mean an entire operating system is $30. $4 more than that for a FTP client sounds ridiculously expensive to me. At the end, I decided to run Terminal and see if I remembered the stuff I played around 20 years ago. Fortunately I did.</p></p>
<p>Long story short, Cyberduck is gone. Because of Google.</p></p>
