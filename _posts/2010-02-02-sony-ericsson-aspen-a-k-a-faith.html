Sony Ericsson's Aspen is the first smartphone with Windows Mobile 6.5.3. The Aspen also known as Faith has an overall sleek design with a QWERTY keyboard that looks quite solid. Of course, that's just my opinion from pictures without having experienced the smartphone. The 2.4-inch touchscreen TFT LCD with a 320x240 pixel format is a bit on the small side. The number of pixels is a bit on the low side too. Hopefully the hardware, OS and applications work seamlessly. Other specs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Camera: 3.2 Megapixel</li>
<li>Connectivity: A-GPS, 3.5-mm Audio, WiFi</li>
<li>Storage: microSD</li>
<li>Network: Quad-Band GSM/EDGE with HSPA 900/2100 or 850/900/2100</li><br />
</ul><br />
Windows Mobile 6.5.3 is now more finger-friendly and supports capacitive multitouch displays acknowledging pan and flick gestures. The browser is faster and memory management has been enhanced.
