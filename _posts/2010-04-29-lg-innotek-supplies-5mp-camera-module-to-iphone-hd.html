<p>According to the <a href="http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2010/04/29/2010042900472.html">Chosun Ilbo</a> the next-gen iPhone, which I will call iPhone HD (read <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/03/30/iphone-hd/"><em>iPhone HD</em></a>, will make use of a 5 megapixel camera (read <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/09/22/2010-iphone-5-megapixel-1080p-30fps-video-recording/"><em>2010 iPhone: 5 Megapixel, 1080p 30fps Video Recording</em></a>) built by LG Innotek. Production has already started at the company's Gumi plant and will enter into mass production in 2H'10.</p>
