<p><strong>LED TV It Is Not</strong> You're thinking, "Yeah, but it's not a LED TV." <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/06/23/led-tv/">There is no such thing as a "LED TV"</a> (to use at home) as Samsung would have you believe. The "LED TV" Samsung is fooling everyone with is actually a LCD TV using an <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=edge-lit+led+backlight&amp;sa=Search#1379">edge-lit LED backlight</a> (not even the best type). Unfortunately, and it is very unfortunate, Sony is going the same direction by making use of an edge-lit LED backlight for its XBR10 LCD TVs. Without even seeing the picture, I can bet serious coin that it will lose out in picture quality compared to the XBR9 series. <a id="more"></a><a id="more-6952"></a></p>
<p><strong>Slim</strong> What the XBR10 has is a very slim profile: edge-lit LED backlight technology will let you do that. To keep the slim profile all of the connections are via an external box. The XBR10 displays connect to the box wirelessly. The only cable that comes out of the thin display is a power cord. You will absolutely need to mount an XBR10 display on the wall to make use of the thinness, otherwise you're wasting a lot of money. $5000 to be exact, for the 52-inch, and $4500 for the smaller 46-inch. Other features include a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=240hz&amp;sa=Search#1099">240Hz</a> frequency and the BRAVIA Engine 3. Video can be streamed from Amazon, YouTube, Netflix and Sony's Yahoo! Widgets.</p>
<p><strong>Wrong Way</strong> It isn't surprising that Sony is going this direction. Sony invested heavily in Samsung's LCD manufacturing capabilities that makes very large LCD TV panels. Samsung has been using edge-lit LED backlights, making fools of everyone and selling a whole bunch of "LED TVs". Sony wants in on the action and so here it is: the not-so-great but really thin and extremely expensive XBR10.</p>
