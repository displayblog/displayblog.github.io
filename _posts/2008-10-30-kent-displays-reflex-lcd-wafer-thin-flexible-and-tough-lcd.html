  has developed a new LCD that is extremely thin, quite flexible and is rugged. How
  thin? How about 30 microns, thinner than a strand of hair. It is also rugged enough
  for military applications. The prototype sports a pixel format of 320 x 160, not
  quite ready for prime time but the prototype shows that this new LCD can be easily
  seen in very bright ambient environments. \"Reflex\" is the LCD coating that allows
  for ultra-wide viewing angles and high viewability in bright sunlight. Reflex is
  based on <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=cholesteric-lcd\">cholesteric
  LCD</a> (<a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=chlcd\">ChLCD</a>)
  technology. Reflex displays do not require any power to maintain an image so as
  long as the image on the LCD does not change the Reflex display is consuming zero
  energy. <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=electronic-price-tag\">Electronic
  price tag</a>s in supermarkets or larger ones at gas stations might be potential
  applications. In other words, Kent Displays' Reflex LCD feature similar features
  to <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=electronic-paper-display\">electronic
  paper display</a> technology developed by companies like <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=e-ink\">E
  Ink</a>. "

<p>With this new LCD, Kent Displays has developed what is called "eGo", an electronic skin for <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=mobile-phone">mobile phone</a>s that allow the user to change the color or graphics that are displayed simply by touching it. Imagine the possibilities! eGo electronic skin not only for mobile devices but for practically everything: <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=notebook-pc">notebook PC</a>s, keyboards, mice, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=e-book-reader">e-book reader</a>s, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=digital-photo-frame">digital photo frame</a>s, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-monitor">LCD monitor</a>s, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a>s, credit cards, clothing, toys... the list goes on.</p>
<p>Kent Displays has a roll-to-roll manufacturing capacity in the US that can manufacture millions of plastic displays on an annual basis. Not only that, the cost of manufacturing will be reduced by a significant amount. Production on the company's new manufacturing line is expected to commence in January 2009, just a couple of months away. This LCD technology originated at the Liquid Crystal Institute (LCI) at Kent State University. Kent Displays was founded in 1993 by Dr. J. William Doane and William Manning of Manning Ventures of Rochester, NY. The company is located close to LCI in Kent, Ohio.</p>
