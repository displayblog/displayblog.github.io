<p><a href="http://displayblog.com/2016/08/25/amzn-tv24/">Click here for a brief description about DISPLAYBLOG&rsquo;s AMZN.TV24 market research</a>. As promised, I'll be sharing some insights about which size gives you the biggest bang for your hard-earned buck. Let's start with 1080p TVs.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>$/Inch - 1080p</strong></p><br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26876" src="http://displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/AMZNTV24_20160831_PerInch1080p.jpg" alt="AMZN.TV24 2016.08.31 $ Per Inch 1080p" width="590" height="398" /></p>
<p>Some observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>75-inch: Each inch will cost you more than $26, and is by far the most expensive.</li>
<li>65-inch: At one point it came really close to matching the $/Inch metric of 60-inch, but is roughly about $15 per inch.</li>
<li>60-inch: $/inch has been steady at a little over $11.</li>
<li>55-inch: Currently just under $10/inch, is closer to 50-inch than 60-inch.</li>
<li>50-inch: At about $8/inch, you get the most inch for your buck.</li><br />
</ul><br />
Really large -- and at the moment 75-inch TVs are considered really large -- are way more expensive than smaller sizes because LCD manufacturers can't make a lot of them. LCD manufacturers use a single sheet of glass and then cut that in to different sizes. Innolux, LG Display, and Samsung are currently manufacturing 75-inch LCD panels at their Gen 7 fabs and Innolux plans to quadruple 75-inch panel&nbsp;production from 5K/mo in Q2'16 to 20K/mo in Q3'16. With a bit more supply prices will certainly come down a bit.</p>
<p>50-inch TVs sound a little too small for a living room in the United States, where homes are generally large. But even for smaller condominiums and apartments consumers then to purchase the biggest TV they can afford. Although prices have increased recently, I expect 55-inch TVs to be the best deal going forward.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>$/Inch - 4K</strong></p><br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26877" src="http://displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/AMZNTV24_20160831_PerInch4K.jpg" alt="AMZN.TV24 2016.08.31 $ Per Inch 4K" width="590" height="398" /></p>
<p>Here are some observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>70-inch: At 4K the largest that consistently show up on Amazon's front search result page is 70-inch. (FYI, there is a $32,000 98-inch NEC 4K TV, but I'm considering that an outlier.) At more than $28/inch the 70-inch 4K TVs are extremely expensive.</li>
<li>65-inch: The $/inch drops down considerably at 65-inch to just under $22/inch.</li>
<li>60-inch: There has been a recent upswing at 60-inch due to expensive models from Samsung. Prior to the Samsung models the average $/inch at 60-inch was $16/inch and change, but since August 27 the average has gone up to over $20/inch at which point the 65-inch becomes a really good deal in comparison.</li>
<li>55-inch: There is a huge drop to $13.50/inch.</li>
<li>50-inch: Although slightly more affordable at less than $13/inch 50-inch seems small at 4K and has been dropping off the front page recently.</li><br />
</ul><br />
Unless you have too much money and don't know what to do with it, 70-inch 4K TVs at $28/inch is expensive. You're paying more than double per inch compared to a 55-inch 4K TV. Prices will decline as more LCD manufacturers shift to larger TVs to catch larger profit margins, but until that happens you'll be paying a serious premium for 70-inch 4K TVs.</p>
<p>65-inch and 60-inch are about the same so I think the larger 65-inch is the better deal. By far the best deal where you get the biggest bang (inches) for your dollar is at 55-inch for 4K TVs. Don't even consider 50-inch, unless you want to put it in your bedroom.</p>
<p>There you go: 55-inch TVs sweep both 1080p and 4K categories for best bang for your buck. Hope that was interesting to you. Tomorrow I'll be sharing some insights about Samsung.</p>
