<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OQVZDJM">Amazon</a>: <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2013/11/26/300ppi-amazon-kindle-paperwhite/">About seven months ago there was a rumor that this was going to happen</a>. The 6-inch E Ink display now sports a 300 ppi resolution. Combined with Amazon's new-custom-default font called Bookerly &mdash; bye-bye Caecilia &mdash; it should make text more pleasant to read. But what is more important is the not-so-new news of a new layout engine. <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3046678/the-kindle-finally-gets-typography-that-doesnt-suck">John Brownlee does a thorough job of explaining the brand new engine (and font)</a>, but here's the Cliff's Notes version: The old typesetting engine had one thing in mind: line up words left and right, and add as many spaces as needed. The result was terrible. The new engine keeps space between words consistent, and it hyphenates! The Kindle has finally entered the 21st century.</p>
<p>I've recently had a change of mind. OLED, E Ink, IPS LCD... they are all good in their own ways, but when it comes to reading a book or a magazine I've decided paper provides the best experience. So no matter how good the Kindle E Ink display gets I'll be turning to Amazon to buy a nice hardback version of the book. This means I can't buy as many books as before since hardback books are quite a bit more expensive than e-books, but it will force me to be more selective and to read the few books I do get more thoughtfully.</p>
