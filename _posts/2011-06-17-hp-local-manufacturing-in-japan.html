<p><a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2011/06/17/report-hp-moves-part-of-notebook-production-from-china-to-japan/">CrunchGear</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[...] HP apparently wants to increase efficiency, be closer to the market, stand out with a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;made-in-Japan&acirc;&euro;¬ù moniker, and push down delivery times especially to Japanese business customers.</blockquote></p>
<p>Made-in-Japan notebooks will find their way to customers in many other countries who would prefer them over those that are tagged, "Made in China".</p>
