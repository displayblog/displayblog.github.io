This one is interesting. The LS201 is not a wide LCD monitor. Instead, it is a regular 4:3. The pixel format of 1400 x 1050 gets you slightly more screen real estate compared to 17" and 19" LCD monitors that almost always have 1280 x 1024 pixel formats. ASUS is touting its ASUS Smart Contrast (ASRC) Technology that improves contrast ratio to 2000:1. The LCD is protected with a glass rated at 9H hardness that will prevent most (if not all) scratches. There is also a anti-reflection coating to reduce light reflection to under 2%. Finally, the title says that this is the Luxury Slim Series. The depth has been checked in two places (<a href="http://www.asus.com/products.aspx?l1=10&amp;l2=140&amp;l3=509&amp;l4=0&amp;model=1615&amp;modelmenu=2">Asus website</a>, <a href="http://event.asus.com/lcd/ls201en/">Asus mini-site for its Luxury Slim Series under "specifications"</a>) with a depth of 260mm or about 10.2". That is pretty thick! Even <a href="http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;cs=19&amp;sku=320-4687">Dell's UltraSharp 2007FP</a> 20" with 1600 x 1200 pixel format has a depth of only 7.6". Now, if it was a typo and the actual depth of the LS201 was just 26mm or just over 1", that would be considered slim.</p>
