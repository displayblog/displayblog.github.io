<p>One hallmark of classic or retro gear is that they lack displays. Instead, these simply cool devices have a lot of knobs. Numark's PT-01USB is a case in point. There is no display, three knobs and one little switch. How simple. How cool. Of course, it would have been cooler if there was a touch-enabled red LED display for control and displaying current settings. The PT-01USB comes with a USB cable (a must!), a 45RPM adapter (for singles) and a phono cartridge.</p>
<p>The PT-01USB, using the software that comes with it, transfers tracked songs directly into iTunes. How convenient is that! In addition, if you download Gracenote's MusicID, naming tracks becomes automatic.</p>
<p>Each recording of LPs into MP3s will be unique. I have a fairly large collection of LPs that have been stored for more than two decades. These have tiny microscopic scratches in them that make them literally one-of-a-kind. And so will my MP3 recordings of them. I can't wait to get my hands on the PT-01USB so I can relive my earlier years, listening to my music the way I did, with all the bumps and noises.</p>
