<p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/digitaltrends/20110331/tc_digitaltrends/hottestthingonebaymaybetheipad2">Yahoo! News</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Curiously, the most popular iPad 2 models sold were the bare-bones 16 GB version with only Wi-Fi, and the fully tricked-out version with 64 GB of storage and 3G capability.</blockquote></p>
<p>Canada and Russia were the biggest iPad 2 importers. I think Apple should move to a single-day global rollout.</p>
