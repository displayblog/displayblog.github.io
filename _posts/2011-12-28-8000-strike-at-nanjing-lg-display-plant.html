<blockquote><p>By Wednesday evening the dispute, which involved some 8,000 people and forced a partial shutdown of production at LG Display&acirc;&euro;&trade;s factory in Nanjing, appeared to be moving towards resolution after three days of protests.</blockquote></p>
<p>The reason for the strike: year-end bonuses. Modularizing LCD panels is labor intensive, so LCD manufacturers rushed into China to set up LCD module factories. I gather from this strike cost has been increasing for some time. At some point companies will look to mechanized labor as a solution. <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21525432">Earlier this year Foxconn CEO Terry Gou revealed plans to use one million robots by 2013</a>. But as soon as labor robotization becomes the norm for simple, repetitive tasks the China advantage will start to disappear.</p>
