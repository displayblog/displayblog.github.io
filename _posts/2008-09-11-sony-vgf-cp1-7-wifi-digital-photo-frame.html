  able to connect to it via MemoryStick, SD or CF. I wonder if you can stream photos
  from your PC via WiFi... "

<p>Digital photo frames are quite popular these days. But a lot of them are fairly ugly. Sony's VGF-CP1 is a 7" digital photo frame that actually looks nice. In addition it has WiFi capability allowing you to stream Picasa photos.

<p>Probably not. The display is a 7" TFT LCD with a pixel format of 800 x 480. 800 x 480 sounds dismal, but I'll have to check out the display itself to see if it will do your vacation pictures justice. According to Sony the LCD can display 16 million colors, but for some reason I think this is a 6-bit display that uses software algorithms to process 16 million colors not show them. Back to pixel format: How about we shift gears and get up to 1024 x 600 or even 1280 x 800? That couldn't be that hard. And yes, I think I will be willing to pay $50 extra since I'm splurging already by spending $300 on a digital photo frame. Can I get touch with that too?</p>
