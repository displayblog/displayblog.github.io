<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/28/blackberry-torch-coming-to-atandt-in-two-fresh-colors-next-month/">Engadget</a>: RIM doesn't seem to be having any problems making white versions of its wares. The BlackBerry Torch can be had in red or white in addition to standard black. These will be available on November 7th at AT&T.</p>
<p>There is speculation that Apple is having a hard time making white iPhone 4s because of the highly reflective glass back that interferes when taking photos with the flash. So I checked out the back of the BlackBerry Torch: it is ribbed and quite a bit less reflective than the iPhone 4's glass back.</p>
