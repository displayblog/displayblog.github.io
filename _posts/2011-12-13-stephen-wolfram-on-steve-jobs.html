<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2011/dec/11/steve-jobs-obituary-stephen-wolfram">Stephen Wolfram</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Steve took a great interest in the development of Mathematica; in fact, it was he who suggested the name. Although the NeXT was not a commercial success, it was a shrewd move that led to the batch of computers at Cern on which Tim Berners-Lee first developed the web.</blockquote></p>
<p>Didn't know Steve Jobs was behind the name Mathematica.</p>
