<p>Roger Cheng at <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-20079905-94/itc-says-htc-violating-two-of-apples-patents/">CNET</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The ITC judge's initial determination was that HTC infringed on two of the 10 patents Apple had filed a complaint over in March, according to an HTC statement. A loss carries the threat that HTC's products would be banned from coming into the U.S., and Apple only needs to get a favorable decision on one of the patents.</blockquote></p>
