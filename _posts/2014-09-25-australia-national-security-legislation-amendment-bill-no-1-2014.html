<p><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/consumer-security/terror-laws-clear-senate-enabling-entire-australian-web-to-be-monitored-and-whistleblowers-to-be-jailed-20140926-10m8ih.html">The Sydney Morning Herald</a>: The Senate in Australia voted 44 to 12 on September 25 and passed the National Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2014. The House of Representatives is expected to pass the bill. Here are some factoids:</p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ASIO, which stands for Australian Security Intelligence Organization, needs only a single warrant to access an unlimited number of computers on a computer network. Unfortunate for Australians as well as for anyone in the world &acirc;&euro;&oelig;computer network&acirc;&euro;¬ù is not defined, and could very well mean the entire Internet.</p></li></p>
<li>
<p>ASIO, with that single warrant, can manipulate data on target computers anyway it wishes.</p></li></p>
<li>
<p>ASIO can disrupt target computers, and use any computer to access target computers. That means ASIO can use <em>your</em> computer to get to a target computer.</p></li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>I am guessing the NSA will be quite happy with the results.</p></p>
