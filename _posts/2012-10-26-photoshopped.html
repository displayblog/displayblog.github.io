<p><a href="http://www.petapixel.com/2012/10/25/shopped-dont-sweat-the-ingredients-and-preparation-just-enjoy-the-meal/">PetaPixel</a>: Processing film = photoshopping RAW. That's how I see it as we transitioned from analog to digital photography. But something happened on the way. It is difficult to process film; it's easy to photoshop RAW image files. I think that's the problem some of us have with photoshopped photographs: it's too easy to make photographs look nice. The easier it is to do something the less value we give it; the harder it is the more value we give it. If someone accomplishes the impossible, that's amazing. Photoshopping is too easy, anyone can do it, and because it's so easy very little value is attributed to photoshopped photographs, which is nearly all professional photographs. If you desire your photography to be highly valued try accomplishing something that's extremely difficult. A fine example is <a href="http://www.petapixel.com/2012/10/26/photographer-makes-name-for-herself-photographing-tiny-waves/">Australian photographer Deb Morris</a>: She photographs miniature waves.</p>
