<p><a href="http://www.geeky-gadgets.com/lgs-p220-laptop-looks-like-a-macbook-pro-31-05-2011/">Geeky Gadgets</a>: The LG P220 notebook is very similar looking to a MacBook Pro. There are obvious differences like the display hinge, indicators on the front edge (exactly the place where it is impossible to see at a glance), the trackpad button, the vent on the side, but the overall design utterly lacks in creativity.</p>
<p>LG reportedly incorporated <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/04/25/lg-display-shuriken-display/">LG Display's Shuriken Display</a> into the P220 but the bezel doesn't look all that thin to me. Compared to a 13.3-inch MacBook Pro the display looks almost identical, except the bottom bezel looks a bit thicker on the P220. And why would you place a webcam at the bottom?</p>
