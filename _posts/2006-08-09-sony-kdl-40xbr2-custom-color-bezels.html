<p>The KDL-40XBR2 is a very decent LCD TV with Full HD resolution (1920 x 1080 pixels) that use a Wide Color Gamut CCFL (WCG-CCFL) to improve the color gamut beyond the typical 72% NTSC provided by ordinary CCFLs. Viewing angles can't get much better at 178 degrees. Dynamic contrast ratio that is controlled by a chip brings it up to 7000:1 from a static contrast ratio of 1300:1. There are 3 HDMI inputs, a VGA input for your PC, a S-Video input and others. But one of the coolest things about the KDL-40XBR2 has nothing to do with the display: it's the bezel.</p>

<p>You get five colors to choose from: Arctic White (the Sony guys misspelled this one as Artic White), Velvet Black, Scarlet Red, Pacific Blue and Sienna Brown. Having just two color schemes (black and silver) makes for a difficult time to match anything in your house. Unless you live in modern Apple-esque home, the black and silver isn't going to match anything. These colors will enhance the flexibility of integrating high-tech items into a more colorful environment.</p>
