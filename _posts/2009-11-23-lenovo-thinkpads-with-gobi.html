<p>Gobi is Qualcomm's multimode 3G mobile data chipset. Starting in 2010 <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=lenovo&amp;sa=Search#1348">Lenovo</a> will equip its <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=thinkpad&amp;sa=Search#1348">ThinkPads</a> with Gobi2000: X, T and W series. A great move by Lenovo since a major portion of its customers are business people who travel. Gobi can connect to both HSPA and EV-DO systems with GPS to boot. WiMax, LTE and China's TD-SCDMA are not supported, yet. Some ThinkPads already have the previous version of Gobi (Gobi1000): X200, T400, T500, W500. How about Gobi for smartphones?
