<p><a href="http://delimiter.com.au/2011/03/07/trinity-ipad-trial-recommends-wider-rollout/">Delimiter</a>: Trinity College, an University of Melbourne residential college, conducted its Step Forward project that involved giving iPads to 44 university students and several dozen academic staff. The result of the project:</p>
<blockquote><p>iPads are effective, durable, reliable and achieve their educational aims of going further, faster and with more fun.</blockquote></p>
<p>One major limitation was the inability to exchange information across applications unless connected to a computer. Hopefully this current iOS limit will be lifted with a revamped, and free, cloud-based storage and syncing service from Apple. The iPads were found to be an enhancement, not a replacement, for desktop or notebook PCs. This rings all the more true since you can't even get an iPad working without connecting it to a computer and then activating it. Despite these limitations all Trinity College students entering this fall will be getting iPads.</p>
