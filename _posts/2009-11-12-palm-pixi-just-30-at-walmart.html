<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7685 aligncenter" title="Palm_Pixi" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Palm_Pixi.jpg" alt="Palm_Pixi" width="480" height="464" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.palm.com/us/products/phones/pixi/index.html">Palm</a>: An unbelievable price of US$30 for the Palm Pixi that originally goes for $199.99 with a 2-year contract with Sprint. It seems Sprint's "Sprint Simply Everything" plan is included with this deal that goes for $99.99 per month. There is also a $36 activation fee. But the $30 price for the Palm Pixi is low, real low.</p>
