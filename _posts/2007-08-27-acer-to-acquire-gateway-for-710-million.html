<p>Today, August 27, 2007, Acer announced that it will purchase all of Gateway's outstanding shares for $1.90 per share and has been approved by the boards of directors at both companies.&Acirc;&nbsp;The two companies are expecting the deal to be completed by the end of&Acirc;&nbsp;this year, of course, given that the US government approves. Acer moved first and Lenovo can't buy Packard Bell. Gateway has the right of first refusal if a company desires to purchase shares in Packard Bell's parent company, PB Holding Co. SARL.</p>
<p><em>Statistics<br />
</em>Acer + Gateway: 18.6 million PCs in 2006<br />
Lenovo: 16.6 million PCs in 2006<br />
Acer in US:&Acirc;&nbsp;Increase of 164%&Acirc;&nbsp;Y/Y in Q2'07 with 888,000 PCs&Acirc;&nbsp;sold, 5.2% share of US market<br />
Gateway in US: 965,000 PCs sold in Q2'07 with 5.6% share of US market<br />
Acer + Gateway in US: #3 behind HP and Dell&Acirc;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Opinion</em><br />
Sounds good on paper but will require a lot of work. Just as it was with&Acirc;&nbsp;HP purchasing Compaq, the&Acirc;&nbsp;Gateway purchase by Acer will require a tremendous amount of work aligning&Acirc;&nbsp;work culture and strategic goals. We should also note that this is the second&Acirc;&nbsp;major PC company&Acirc;&nbsp;that is being sold to an Asian company recently, IBM's PC division&Acirc;&nbsp;was sold to&Acirc;&nbsp;Lenovo not too long ago. I'm not anti-Asian, but I don't like seeing Asian companies gobbling up US companies as I would like to see US companies stay US companies since I live in the US. It will be sad to see Gateway go. I remember a long time ago flipping through PC magazines that had Gateway advertisements with cows. Those were cool.</p>
