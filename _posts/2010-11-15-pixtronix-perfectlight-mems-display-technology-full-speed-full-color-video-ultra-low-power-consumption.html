<p><a href="http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Pixtronix-and-Chimei-Innolux-Successfully-Develop-MEMS-Display-Prototypes-1348791.htm">Pixtronix</a>: All smartphone users want their smartphones to last longer. All smartphones sport a display that likes to suck power like there's no tomorrow, literally. Pixtronix has a solution in its PerfectLight MEMS display technology. MEMS stands for Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems and can be used instead of liquid crystals. There are significant advantages.</p>
<p>Liquid crystals are eliminated and so are color filters, which absorb about 70% of the brightness coming out of the backlight. Polarizers are thrown out too. By getting rid of these three layers in the display power consumption is reduced by 75%. You're thinking: "Well, I'm sure display performance is reduced by 75%, too."</p>
<p>Pixtronix worked with Chimei Innolux (CMI) and developed some prototypes that were showcased during FPD International 2010. These featured:</p>
<ul>
<li>135% NTSC color gamut</li>
<li>24-bit color depth</li>
<li>170-degree viewing angles</li>
<li>100 microsecond shutter response times</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>That's mighty impressive. Pixtronix and CMI will need to work closely with smartphone brands and the OS provider to make sure color is accurate and doesn't needlessly pop. OLED displays have high color gamuts but the colors pop too much leading to wholly inaccurate colors. What you see on your OLED display isn't what you're going to get when you print it or even when you look at it on a color-tuned display.</p>
<p>The 170-degree viewing angles are good enough but need to be better to compete with the best, which are 178 degrees using IPS technology. The response time is out of this world and there is no LCD that comes close. LCD response times are in the milliseconds (ms) and that is 1000 times slower than a microsecond (&Acirc;&micro;s). That puts the 100&Acirc;&micro;s PerfectLight MEMS at least 10 times faster than a 1ms LCD. Watching videos or playing action games on a Pixtronix PerfectLight MEMS display sounds very tempting. Don't forget that power consumption is reduced by 75%. That means you can watch more than a couple of movies or play games for quite a bit longer.</p>
<p>Imagine having a plasma display on your mobile but without image sticking and the power consumption. Now imagine your notebook PC or tablet having one of these PerfectLight MEMS displays. Pixtronix says larger prototypes will be developed in 2011.</p>
