<p>via <a href="http://en.akihabaranews.com/74909/displays/sony-develops-hybrid-fpa-a-novel-liquid-crystal-alignment-technique-that-achieves-faster-response-time-for-liquid-crystal-displays?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=sony-develops-hybrid-fpa-a-novel-liquid-crystal-alignment-technique-that-achieves-faster-response-time-for-liquid-crystal-displays">Akihabara News</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sony previously developed the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;FPA&acirc;&euro; high-speed liquid crystal response alignment technique based on vertical alignment (VA) liquid crystal modes. One method for improving liquid crystal response time is to generate pre-tilt of the liquid crystal molecules. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;FPA&acirc;&euro; technique uses the alignment layer developed by Sony and maintains pre-tilt of liquid crystal molecules by irradiating UV while applying voltage in manufacturing process. This facilitates the stable and even alignment of the liquid crystal molecules, thus achieving improvements in both liquid crystal response time and the contrast ratio. In addition, this has made it possible to eradicate the Mura (uniformity problem) in the display as well as to eliminate the &acirc;&euro;&tilde;sticking image&acirc;&euro;&trade; that can occur after long-term use.</blockquote></p>
<p>Fast response times mean less motion blur. The term "Mura" refers to different levels of brightness in different areas of the display. Sony's FPA takes care of that as well as image sticking also known as ghosting. I'm not certain how contrast is improved.</p>
<blockquote><p>[...] &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Hybrid FPA&acirc;&euro; technology has achieved an even faster liquid crystal response time by maintained the pre-tilt on just one side of the substrate alignment layer (see illustration). Furthermore, this new technology has succeeded in facilitating drastic improvements in liquid crystal response time, especially faster movement of liquid crystal molecule when decreasing the voltage which was previously difficult to achieve, as well as higher contrast. </blockquote></p>
<p>Liquid crystals normally respond better with higher voltage. The liquid crystals in Sony's "Hybrid FPA" are fast even with lower voltages.</p>
