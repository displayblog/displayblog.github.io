<p><a href="http://www.pc-ap.fujitsu.com/products/vt/p8010_pg_3-5g.html">Fujitsu</a> via <a href="http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2008/07/01/fujitsu-p8010-le-bri.html">Boing Boing</a> <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/07/01/fujitsu-unveils-lifebook-p8010-pink-gold-edition-with-wwan/">Engadget</a>: The Fujitsu LifeBook P8010 Pink Gold Edition is a very portable notebook PC that sports a 12.1" wide LCD with a pixel format of 1280x800. The P8010 comes with 3.5G HSDPA WWAN capability and has a built-in DL DVD writer. The company claims that the battery will last for 5.9 hours, which really means about 4 1/2 hours if you use it more than just looping a MP3 file with the LCD brightness down to barely visible. Boing Boing's review got about 4 hours.</p>

<p>One of the features that Fujitsu is touting with its P8010 is the edge-to-edge 12.1" wide LCD. It is not quite edge-to-edge since most LCDs require a physical bezel around it, but the P8010 does have some very thin bezels on each side. The bezel thickness on top is quite, well, thick due to the webcam. In my opinion, Apple does a very good job of keeping the webcam functionality intact while not making the top bezel unnecessarily thick. The unique Pink Gold color actually makes it look very upscale. And so does the price of around US$2,748!</p>
