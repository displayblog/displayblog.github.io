<p>Just received a press release from CMI announcing a 5-inch 1920x1080 AAS LCD sporting a 443 ppi:</p>
<blockquote><p>Based on AAS (Azimuthal Anchoring Switch) display technology, CMI develops 5-inch Full HD LCD modules that meet the market trend and requirements for future smart phone.</p>
<p>At Touch Taiwan 2012, CMI showcases the 5-inch Full HD LCD module with 1080x1920 resolutions and 443 ppi. The 5-inch Full HD LCD module features &acirc;&euro;&oelig;high resolution&acirc;&euro;, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;narrow border&acirc;&euro; and &acirc;&euro;&oelig;thin cell&acirc;&euro;, which delivers higher flexibility of smart phone industrial design.</blockquote></p>
<p>The next milestone for large smartphone displays seems to be 1920x1080 5-inch LCDs. During SID 2012 <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2012/05/27/lg-display-5-inch-1920x1080-lcd/">LG Display also showcased a 5-inch 1920x1080 AH-IPS LCD</a>.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.08.29:</em> <a href="http://www.chimei-innolux.com/opencms/cmo/media_center/News/index.html?news_no=0&__locale=en">Source link at CMI</a>, a photo, and a few additional technical specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brightness (white): 500 nits</li>
<li>Viewing Angles: 160/160</li>
<li>Contrast Ratio: 1100:1</li>
<li>Colors: 16.7 million</li>
<li>Color Gamut: 72%</li>
<li>Internal Video Interconnect: MIPI</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>With such a high ppi the white brightness of 500 nits is incredible. I hope black brightness levels are low producing deep blacks. The photo does not detail which color space, but I assume it is CIE 1976. I believe a color gamut of 72% CIE 1976 is better than almost all notebook LCDs. The 5-inch 1920x1080 LCD from CMI is an impressive mobile display and I look forward to seeing one in a future smartphone.</p>
