<p class="P2">On July 12, Taiwan-based Forhouse and German-based Degussa AG held an opening ceremony for their joint venture to manufacture optical-grade polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) molding compounds for light guide panels and diffuser films used in  <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=backlight">backlight</a> units (BLUs). Degussa hols 51% and Forhouse holds the rest. The PMMA plant will have a 40,000-ton annual capacity. Forhouse alone would require 80,000 tons per year requiring the plant to expand in the future. Forhouse has a 2.5 million BLU per month capacity with plants in China and Taiwan. The company's Xiamen plant located in China has a monthly capacity of 400,000 BLUs.</p></p>
