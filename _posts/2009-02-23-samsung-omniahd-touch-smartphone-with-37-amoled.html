<p>Samsung's OMNIAHD seems to be an awesome smartphone with the best-in-class technical capabilities. First off is the brilliant 3.7" AMOLED (Active Matrix OLED) display. Since the original OMNIA featured a 3.3" TFT LCD with a 480 x 800 pixel format, I'm guessing the enhanced OMNIAHD will feature at least 480 x 800 pixels on the larger 3.7" AMOLED display. <em>Update: I was wrong. The 3.7" AMOLED has a much lower 640 x 360 (landscape) pixel format. Oh well.</em> The touch, a TouchWiz implementation, is capacitive and from <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/02/16/samsung-omniahd-hands-on-now-with-more-touchwiz/">an Engadget video</a> the system seems to be responding quite well.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-4156"></a></p>
<p>Samsung claims the OMNIAHD is the first smartphone to record 720p HD video. Interal playback of HD content will be at QHD or quarter HD that means 640 x 360 at at full 720p HD externally. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/02/17/samsung-omniahds-camera-put-to-the-test/">An initial review by Engadget on a pre-production unit regarding HD recording</a> was sluggish in performance "both in the on-screen preview and in the finished product".</p>
<p>The OMNIAHD also features a 8MP digital camera. The built-in digital camera is not one of the tiny little ones found on the iPhone but in typical Samsung fashion a relatively large installation on the back. I hope the picture quality turns out to be really good. Speaking of the iPhone, I have received feedback from my friends in Korea who think it is a bit large. I wonder what they would think about an even larger OMNIAHD.</p>
<p>With Samsung's OMNIAHD we can see a glimpse of the future where we REALLY just carry one digital device to do pretty much everything--from voice communications, GPS navigation, digital photography to HD video recording. I look forward to a production version of the OMNIAHD.</p>
