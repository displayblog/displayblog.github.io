<p>The process of taking a picture, developing a picture and then framing that picture is of course interesting but tedious, especially if you want to change the picture from time to time. What if you had something that took out the last two steps and replaced it with a software program that did them automatically. I think the folks over at A Living Picture, a British company, found a way to do it. The Momento photo frame comes in 7" and 10" sizes and you upload photos via a WiFi connection. Of course, this assumes a few things. You'll need a WiFi network and a WiFi-capable computer (if you don't want to go back to your office every time you download pictures from your digital camera). The design of the Momento looks clean and if it works simply and easily, I think they might be onto something.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Momento is only Windows-compatible. I would have loved to see a Momento-like device that works well with iPhoto. Now, wouldn't that be great? The 7" is $200 and will be available on December 1, 2006. Source: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/16/technology/16frame.html?ref=technology">New York Times</a></p>
