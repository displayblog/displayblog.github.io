As reported on <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20100625PD220.html">DIGITIMES</a> and according to HTC, its Wildfire Android 2.1-based smartphone has the lowest introductory price for the company at NT$11,900 or about US$372. That doesn't sound so low, but I'm guessing that price is unsubsidized. The HTC Wildfire features a smallish 3.2-inch capacitive touch display with a fairly low pixel count of 320x240, a 5 megapixel camera and is available on Taiwan Mobile. For those that have smaller hands or just prefer something a little smaller than the giant Motorola Droid X (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/15/motorola-droid-x/">Motorola Droid X</a></em>) or the HTC EVO 4G, the Wildfire might just be the right size. In the next few months the HTC Wildfire will hit Australia, Hong Kong, India part of Southeast Asia and South Korea.</p>
