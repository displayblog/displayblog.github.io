<p><a href="http://qz.com/211590/microsofts-new-surface-makes-the-case-for-a-bigger-ipad/#/">Dan Frommer, Quartz</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Really, Microsoft has just made a good argument for Apple to release a larger (and even thinner) iPad Pro sometime sooner than later &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; <a href="http://www.splatf.com/2014/01/ipad-mini-air/">that actually sounds great</a>.</blockquote></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/05/20/microsoft-surface-pro-3/">Microsoft Surface Pro 3</a> sports a 12-inch 3:2 (1.5:1) display. The iPads are all 4:3 (1.33:1). If an iPad Pro were to grow in size to 12 inches I think it might be too wide (in portrait mode), but I also don't think Apple would change the aspect ratio. Usability for a 12-inch 4:3 iPad Pro might be less than ideal.</p>
