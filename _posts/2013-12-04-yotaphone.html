<p><a href="http://www.yotaphone.com/#/en/">Yota Devices</a>: The YotaPhone Android smartphone sports <em>two</em> 4.3-inch displays. The main screen on the front is a LCD with a 1280x720 pixel format with a resolution of about 342 ppi. The back screen is a 640x360 electronic paper display (EPD) with 16 levels of grey.</p>
<p>I can make good use of this. The only, and best, use of the EPD is to read text; most other uses detailed by Yota Devices are gimmicky. I read, a lot, everyday and most of it is on my iPhone because the iPhone is almost always with me, but my eyes get tired reading on the LCD. If instead I could read on an EPD &mdash; text only and stripped of all the chrome and ads &mdash; I think I would enjoy reading quite a bit more.</p>
