<p><a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/05/25/apple_aims_to_improve_ipad_2_availability_with_another_backlight_maker.html">AppleInsider</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Coretronic is said to now be looking to expand into the tablet market, specifically by supplying backlights for Apple's iPad. The company is reportedly working with Chimei innolux to provide backlight modules, but Chimei was only certified by Apple this month.</blockquote></p>
<p>Somehow Chimei Innolux (CMI) has acquired the necessary IPs and know-how to manufacture IPS (In-Plane Switching) LCDs for Apple's iPad. Let's hope Apple improves its display quality requirements so we don't experience problems like light bleeding on an otherwise wonderful display.</p>
