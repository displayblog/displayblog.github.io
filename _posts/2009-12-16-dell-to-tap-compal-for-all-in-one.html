<p>Compal Electronics is expected to receive orders from Dell for its all-in-one PCs, most likely the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/03/12/dell-studio-one-19-185-multitouch-all-in-one/">STUDIO One 19 all-in-ones</a>. Compal would be Dell's second Taiwan-based manufacturing partner, second to Quanta Computer. Compal stated that it will begin shipping all-in-one PCs at the end of 2009 or in Q1'10. Compal currently integrates enterprise notebooks and netbooks for Dell. Sources say Compal has a very good chance at becoming Dell's second source for all-in-one integration.
