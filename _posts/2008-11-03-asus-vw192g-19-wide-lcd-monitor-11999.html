<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=asus">ASUS</a>' VW192G is a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=19"">19"</a> wide TFT LCD monitor with a pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1440-x-900">1440 x 900</a>. It has all the standard features with a decent contrast ratio (800:1) and response time (5ms). The viewing angle is a bit limited due to the TN LCD panel being used, but as long as you don't need accurate colors from the sides (most users don't) you'll be fine. The connection is limited to VGA. This is very similar to the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/11/02/asus-vw193d-19-wide-lcd-monitor-120-at-neweggcom/">VW193D that was on sale at Newegg yesterday</a> except that the viewing angle for the VW192G is just a tad bit less (170/160 vs. 160/160) &Acirc;&nbsp;as well as the contrast ratio (850:1 vs. 800:1). The VW192G is clearly marketed toward the average user and with a price of just $119.99 after a $40 mail-in rebate and an additional $10 promotion, it is a real bargain.
