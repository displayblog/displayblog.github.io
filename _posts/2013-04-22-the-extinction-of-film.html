<p>David S. Cohen, <a href="http://variety.com/2013/film/news/film-jobs-decline-as-digital-distribution-gains-foothold-1200375732/">Variety</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Odds are that before the end of the year, one or more will decide that the meager returns from 35mm screens simply don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t justify the cost of prints, particularly for their tentpole releases.</blockquote></p>
<p>There are almost 40,000 screens in the U.S. and Canada, and 86% have converted to digital according to the National Association of Theatre Owners.</p>
