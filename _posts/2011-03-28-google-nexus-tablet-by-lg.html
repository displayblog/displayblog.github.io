<p><a href="http://mobile-review.com/articles/2011/birulki-112.shtml#2">Mobile Review</a> <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.bgr.com/2011/03/28/lg-to-produce-nexus-tablet-for-google-suggests-rumor/">Boy Genius Report</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to intel acquired by blog Mobile Review, LG has been tasked with producing a pure-Google, Nexus tablet for the Mountain View-based Android maker. </blockquote></p>
<p>As far as I know all Honeycomb tablets are pure, since Google has not opened up the source code so that brands can make modifications. Nonetheless Google has a history of working with a major brand to build a halo product. The Google Nexus One was a collaboration with HTC. The current Nexus S is with Samsung. I guess LG is up next. Might it be called the Nexus Q?</p>
