<p>Twenty one MIT scientists formed an initiative called Production in the Innovation Economy or PIE two years ago. The purpose of PIE was to study how innovation and production are related to each other in the U.S. Today PIE shared <a href="http://web.mit.edu/press/images/documents/pie-report.pdf">what they found</a>. Kelsey Campbell-Dollaghan, <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1671953/the-3-rules-of-innovation-location-location-location">Co.Design</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The synopsis ends with a strong argument for the power of proximity. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;If we believe that they have a real chance, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s because what&acirc;&euro;&trade;s held manufacturing in the United States in the last resort--even as so much turned against it--was the advantage firms gain from proximity to innovation and proximity to users,&acirc;&euro; write the authors. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Even in a world linked by big data and instant messaging, the gains from co-location have not disappeared.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
