<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/11/exclusive-samsung-flagship-phone-with-gingerbread-and-huge-di/">Engadget</a>: 4.5-inch (or 4.3, most likely) 800x480 Super AMOLED 2. That's what this new flagship Gingerbread-based smartphone from Samsung will be using. Not only that it will have a 1.2GHz CPU as well as a 8 megapixel auto-focus camera with LED flash that can record 1080p. And the data connection is wicked fast: 14.4Mbps/5.76Mbps. I wonder what improvements Samsung has made to its existing Super AMOLED display to warrant a suffix of '2' in the next version. Here's what I found: The pixel format jumps from 800x480 to 1280x720, making it a true HD display from a purely hardware point of view.</p>
