<p><a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=9315&tag=nl.e539">ZDNet</a>: <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=apple">Apple</a> sold 1 million of its new <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=apple-3g">iPhone 3G</a> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=smartphone">smartphone</a>s in just 3 days starting Friday, July 11, 2008 and ending yesterday, Sunday, July 13, 2008. It took 74 days, 71 extra days, for Apple to sell 1 million of its first generation iPhone. One of the biggest changes from last year is that this time <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/06/09/iphone-3g-70-countries-july-11/">the iPhone 3G had a global rollout</a>. On average, Apple sold 425,000 iPhone 3G smartphones each of the three days. Simply amazing.</p>
