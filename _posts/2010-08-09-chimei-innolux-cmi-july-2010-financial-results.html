<p>On August 9, 2010 Chimei Innolux (CMI) announced financial results for July 2010:</p>
<ul>
<li>Net Sales (NT$ Million): Up 1.1% M/M to 45,934</li>
<li>Large-sized Shipment (K units): Down 5.6% M/M to 10,237</li>
<li>Small/Medium-sized Shipment (K units): Down 10.0% M/M to 32,716</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Unit shipments don't say much at all. What we need to know is the size mix. Panel shipments are down but sales are up. Seems to me CMI must be focusing on higher-priced larger-sized LCDs.
