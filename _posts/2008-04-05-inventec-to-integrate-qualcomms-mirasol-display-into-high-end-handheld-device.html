<p>On April 3, 2008, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=qualcomm">Qualcomm</a> MEMS Technologies (QMT) announced that Inventec will be using its micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) based <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=mirasol">mirasol</a> displays for its upcoming high-end handheld devices geared toward Europe and North America. DigiTimes reports that the mirasol display will act as a "secondary viewing area" that does not bring much clarity, but I am guessing that the mirasol display will act as a sub-display.</p>

Qualcomm's mirasol display is based on a technology called interferometric modulation (IMOD) and is based on studies of a butterfly's wings. The wings of a butterfly create vibrant colors by simply using sunlight.<br />

Qualcomm's mirasol display has advantages and disadvantages. One of the key advantages is that it consumes very little power due to a reflective display design that make use of ambient light. Even if there is a modicum of light it is possible to view information on the mirasol display. During last year's SID conference, I cupped my hand over the display and was still able to view information from the mirasol display. There were color versions but at the time much work was needed to bring that up to LCD standards that consumers expect. One of the main disadvantages is that the display is monochrome. However, applied to a sub-display for displaying the time, date and other information that does not require color, the monochrome disadvantage is not significant.<br />
