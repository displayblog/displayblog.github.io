<p>Dieter Bohn, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/17/6353785/amazon-kindle-voyage-e-reader-price-announcement">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Voyage is thinner, lighter, and ever-so-slightly smaller than the Paperwhite, but the big deal is the screen. Amazon has increased the resolution so that it reaches 300 pixels per inch, which makes text incredibly sharp and readable. I ratcheted the text size all the way down to the lowest setting and found it to still be crisp and sharp enough to read. At a more reasonable font setting, it's the best reading experience I've seen on an electronic device.</blockquote></p>
