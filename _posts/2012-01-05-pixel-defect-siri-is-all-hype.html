Post Campus in New York, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2012/01/05/why-siri-is-all-hype/">Dr. Panos Mourdoukoutas</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Siri is all hype. Just like every child gets excited over a new toy and soon forgets about it, Siri will soon be forgotten.</blockquote></p>
<p>The brief article is full of interesting opinions.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-06/apple-s-voice-recognition-siri-doubles-iphone-data-volumes.html">Jonathan Browning, Bloomberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple Inc. (AAPL)&acirc;&euro;&trade;s voice recognition software Siri has prompted owners of the iPhone 4S to use almost twice as much data compared with the handset&acirc;&euro;&trade;s predecessor, placing greater pressure on operators, network firm Arieso said.</blockquote></p>
<p>All hype.</p>
