<blockquote><p>Sony said that the NEX-5R includes a redesigned 16.1 megapixel Exmor CMOS sensor, which integrates 99 phase-detection AF points. The NEX-5R uses those points to quickly acquire a focus point, and then uses contrast detection to refine the focus point (or "confirm extremely fine, precise details," according to Sony). Phase detection is also used during high-speed continuous shooting in order to achieve continuous AF at 10 frames per second.</blockquote></p>
<p>Phase detection AF is used in higher end cameras such as DSLRs. Contrast detection AF is used in lower end cameras such as point-and-shoot cameras and most mirror-less cameras. Phase detection is faster, but contrast detection can be more accurate. The NEX-5R has both. This is the most important feature that makes the NEX-5R better than the NEX-5N. Available in October and priced at US$650 for the body only or $750 with an 18-55 mm kit lens.</p>
