<p><a href="http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF06a/382087-382087-64283-72270-3884471-5163694.html">HP</a>: The ZR2740w sports a matte 10-bit IPS LCD good for over one billion colors. To get that though you'll need to use a DisplayPort connection and 10-bit content. Unfortunately I can't seem to find evidence suggesting there is an embedded programmable lookup table (LUT) for precision color tuning.</p></p>
<p>The 2560x1440 pixel format should be a boon for dual window workers like me allowing two expansive 1280x1440 windows. Unfortunately I would have liked 160 extra vertical pixels for a 16:10 aspect ratio.</p></p>
<p>For some of us who like working in dark environments the ZR2740w can be throttled down to just 50 nits of brightness, saving power and your eyes.</p></p>
<p>One feature I'd like to point out is the HP Quick Release 2 feature. At deployments that require easy access to thousands of monitors, the QR2 system allows for quick and easy dismount by installing a QR2 plate compatible with 100x100 mm VESA holes.</p></p>
<p>The HP ZR2740w is aggressively priced at US$729, undercutting the <a href="/2010/02/10/dell-ultrasharp-u2711/">Dell UltraSharp U2711</a> by $220 and the <a href="/2011/07/20/apple-thunderbolt-display/">Apple Thunderbolt Display</a> by $270.</p></p>
