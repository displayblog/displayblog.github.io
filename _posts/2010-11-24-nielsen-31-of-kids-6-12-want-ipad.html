<p><a href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/consumer/kids-in-the-u-s-eyeing-big-ticket-tech-this-holiday-season/">Nielsen Wire</a>: The iPad is popular with kids from six to 12. Nielsen presented a bunch of them with all sorts of gadgets and asked to share what they would like to buy in the next six months. Thirty one percent had the iPad on the list. The third most popular was the iPod touch with the iPhone at #8 tied with TV, Nintendo 3DS and the Wii.</p>
<p>Although there have been many rumors pointing to very little change in the next-generation iPad, I think the iPad 2.0 will be so significantly different that parents should be saving up their coins to prepare to hand down the current iPad to their children.</p>
