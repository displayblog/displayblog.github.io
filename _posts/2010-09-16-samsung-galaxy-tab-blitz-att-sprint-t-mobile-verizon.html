<p>The Good: The Samsung Galaxy Tab will be blitzing all the major carriers in the US: AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon Wireless. When? Around October or November. A WiFi-only version will also be available. The 3G versions are expected to be tied to new contracts. Unfortunately the Galaxy Tab headed to Sprint will be 3G only, no 4G.</p>
<p>The Bad: You'll be dealing with preloaded carrier apps. Yuck. If these apps are like other preloaded apps on Android smartphones they will require some effort to toss. Another sore point is that you won't be able to make phone calls on the Galaxy Tab like you do on a smartphone. I hear you can with the European version of the Galaxy Tab. Skype and other similar third-party apps can compensate somewhat.</p>
<p>In my opinion, what will make or break the Galaxy Tab is pricing. No official word from Samsung on pricing, yet.</p>
