<p><a href="http://www.blurbusters.com/faq/oled-motion-blur/">Blur Busters</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The flicker of impulse-driven displays (CRT) shortens the frame samples, and eliminates eye-tracking based motion blur. This is why CRT displays have less motion blur than LCD&acirc;&euro;&trade;s, even though LCD pixel response times (1ms-2ms) are recently finally matching phosphor decay times of a CRT (with medium-persistence phosphor). Sample-and-hold displays continuously display frames for the whole refresh.  As a result, a 60Hz refresh is displayed for a whole 1/60th of a second (16.7 milliseconds).</blockquote></p>
