<strong>LED</strong> The SL95 series is just 29.3mm thick and has a bezel border of just 30mm, much thinner that previous models with a 50mm bezel.

<p><strong>Optimization</strong> LG eyeQ Green technology uses an ambient light sensor and modulates brightness, color temperature, contrast, etc. for a total of 4096 adjustments to optimize the picture quality. It has been reported in many other blogs that this technology is responsible for reducing power but they are incorrect: the Smart Energy Saving Plus feature reduces power consumption, by up to 70%. There are four power saving levels. Other notable features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Magic Motion Remote: The remote control can be used like a mouse.</li>
<li>3D GUI: The GUI is easy-to-use and received the 2009 Red dot award.</li>
<li>Multichannel Browser: You can see 54 channels on one page and makes it easy to channel surf.</li>
<li>FUN Games: There are built-in games you can use the Magic Motion Remote to play with.</li>
<li>Calendar: There's even a calendar.</li>
<li>DivX HD / USB: Load your DivX movies into your USB stick and plug it into the SL95 series and watch them. Simple.</li><br />
</ul><br />
The SL95 series from LG looks absolutely wonderful with its simplicity but you'll need to pay up, around two to three times as much as what the average 47-inch and 42-inch LCD TVs cost.</p>
