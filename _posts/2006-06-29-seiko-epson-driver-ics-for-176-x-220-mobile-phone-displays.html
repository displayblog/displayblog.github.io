<p>Seiko Epson's new S1D19501 series driver ICs for 176 x 220 TFT LCD mobile phone displays is a one-chip driver with display data RAM and 262K color capability. A 220-output gate driver and 176-RGB-output source driver is embedded in addition to power circuits into a single chip. The S1D19501 series uses a 0.13 micron process and is Epson's third generation of driver ICs. The short side of the driver IC has been reduced to only 34% of conventional size at 1mm.</p>
