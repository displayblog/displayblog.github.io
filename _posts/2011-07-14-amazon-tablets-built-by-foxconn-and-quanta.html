<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20110714PD208.html">DigiTimes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Foxconn Electronics (Hon Hai Precision Industry) has reportedly landed orders for 10.1-inch tablet PCs from Amazon with shipments to begin in 2012, while Quanta Computer has begun shipping a 7-inch model to Amazon.</blockquote></p>
<p>Wouldn't Amazon want to make its 10.1-inch tablet available during the holiday season this year?</p>
<p>An Amazon tablet combined with the Amazon's Appstore, movies & music, Kindle e-books, cloud storage, etc. might make for a compelling one-stop solution, much like the iPad.</p>
<p>I wonder if Amazon is working on a smartphone, too.</p>
