<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/ready-for-ipad/">Apple</a> has listed iPad-ready websites. iPad-ready means no Flash and yes HTML5. The sites include: CNN, Reuters, New York Times, Vimeo, Time, Major League Baseball, The White House, Virgin America, Sports Illustrated, Flickr, People Magazine, TED. I'm sure there are a lot more to come, and very soon.</p>
