<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-5598 aligncenter" title="lg_55lh90_55_inch_lcd_tv_led_tv_led_backlight" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/lg_55lh90_55_inch_lcd_tv_led_tv_led_backlight.jpg" alt="lg_55lh90_55_inch_lcd_tv_led_tv_led_backlight" width="500" height="343" /></p></p>
<p><strong>LED</strong> LG's 55LH90 is South Korea's first 240Hz LED TV. Well, its smaller siblings 47LH90 and 42LH90 will be too. The 55" LCD TV using a LED backlight has 960 LEDs lighting it up. It's got local dimming too: 90 LED zones are controlled to generate a contrast ratio of more than 2,000,000:1!</p>
<p><strong>240Hz</strong> The 240Hz completely eliminates motion blur. If you're a sports fan, this is a must have. Most advanced LCD TVs employ 120Hz.</p>
<p><strong>THX</strong> This is the first LCD TV to receive THX certification in South Korea. You and I probably already know that sound coming out of a LCD TV is not the greatest. Just a little while ago I did blog about <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/04/08/mitsubishi-unisen-259-diamond-series-46-and-52-16-speaker-ultrathin-120hz-lcd-tvs/">Mitsubishi's Unisen 259 Diamond Series that make use of a soundbar with 16 speakers</a>, which should sound pretty sweet. The THX certification will certainly make the LH90 series LCD TVs sound very good.</p>
<p><strong>KRW 6,400,000</strong> The 55LH90 will cost about US$4764 (based on today's currency rate of KRW1343.4 per US$). Quite expensive! The smaller 47LH90 is KRW4,200,00 (US$3,126) and the 42LH90 is KRW3,300,000 (US$2,456). These LCD TVs are certainly not cheap but 240Hz, a LED backlight, local dimming that generates a contrast ratio of more than 2 million to one, and THX certification should be an interesting package to some of you.</p>
