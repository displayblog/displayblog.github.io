<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-02/samsung-to-drop-counter-suit-against-apple-in-u-s-court.html">Bloomberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Samsung Electronics Co. dropped a patent-infringement suit against Apple Inc. (AAPL), filed at a U.S. federal court in April in response to allegations its Galaxy products copied the iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p>Samsung Electronics dropped the suit on June 30 &acirc;&euro;&oelig;to streamline the legal proceedings,&acirc;&euro;¬ù Nam Ki Yung, a spokesman for the Suwon, South Korea-based company, said today in a telephone interview. Samsung will continue to defend its patent rights through a counter-claim in an earlier suit Apple filed at the same court in San Jose, California, he said.</blockquote></p>
<p>To me, it's simple. Samsung's product design strategy comes from the very top: copy Apple. Everyone knows this. The problem though is how do you prove it?</p>
