<p>Tim Culpan, Adam Satariano and Greg Bensinger at <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-13/apple-white-iphone-is-said-to-be-on-sale-by-end-april-after-10-month-wait.html">Bloomberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple Inc. (AAPL) will start selling a white version of its iPhone 4 in the next few weeks, following a 10-month delay, three people with knowledge of the plans said.</p>
<p>The new model will be available from AT&T Inc. and Verizon Wireless by the end of April, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans aren&acirc;&euro;&trade;t public. The release was stalled as Apple resolved manufacturing challenges, including paint that peeled under heat, one person said.</blockquote></p>
<p>The white paint peeled under heat. Huh. It seems this white paint supplier isn't the same for many other brands. We've seen companies like Samsung manufacture and ship white smartphones and I don't think paint peeling has been a problem.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/14/apple-idUSL3E7FE08K20110414?feedType=RSS&feedName=technologySector&rpc=43">Reuters</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Suppliers to Apple Inc have begun production of white iPhones after a delay of almost 10 months, pointing to a launch date of within a month, two people familiar with the situation said on Thursday.</blockquote></p>
<p>That would be Foxconn, the brand of Hon Hai Precision.</p>
<p>Remember a while back when Steve Jobs was sharing that Apple started with the tablet idea <em>before</em> the iPhone? I think history might repeat itself again here. The white iPad 2 is already out and it seems the white paint on it isn't having any problems with taking photos, videos, or peeling when hot. Maybe Apple figured out how to do white on the iPad 2 and will transfer that knowledge to making the iPhone 4 white. It would be fascinating to find out what really delayed the white iPhone 4, if it really is coming, for 10 months.</p>
