<p>The 190P7 is a 19" 1280 x 1024 LCD monitor and the 200WB7 is a 20" wide format 1680 x 1050 LCD monitor. The 190P7 has 178-degree viewing angles, dual-DVI (something unique!), dual-USB 2.0 ports and can be rotated 90 degrees. The 190P7 will be available in July with an ESP of US$399.</p>
<p>The 200WB7 has 8ms response times, VGA and DVI inputs (no dual-DVI?), 90-degree rotateable and a USB port. The 200WB7 will be available in the fall of 2006 at an ESP of $449. I would think Philips will have to reduce the price of the 200WB7 because Dell's 20" wide LCD TV is already (in May) around this price.</p>
