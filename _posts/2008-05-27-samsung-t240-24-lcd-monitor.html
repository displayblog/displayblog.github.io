<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=samsung">Samsung</a>'s T240 is a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=24"">24"</a> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-monitor">LCD monitor</a> sporting the company's Touch of Color design theme that fuses a bit of red into the black casing. The pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1200">1920 x 1200</a> is good and so is the brightness of 350 cd/m2. The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dynamic-contrast">dynamic contrast</a> ratio of 20,000:1 is quite high and should yield some pretty images. The 5ms response time should be fast enough for most work and play, but you shouldn't think of using this as your main TV since you'll definitely experience some motion blur. Now, there is one thing that's bringing the T240 down a notch and that's the viewing angle of just 160/160. And that means that this otherwise good-looking 24" LCD monitor is sporting a TN LCD panel. TN panels are not bad, but they are not as good as PVA or IPS. I guess you can't have everything...</p>
