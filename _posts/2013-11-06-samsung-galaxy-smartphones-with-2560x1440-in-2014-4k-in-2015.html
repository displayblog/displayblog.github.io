<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/6/5072242/samsun-2014-phones-will-have-78-percent-more-pixels">Vlad Savov, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It's time to start getting used to discussing WQHD resolution, or 2560 x 1440 pixels, in relation to smartphones. Samsung's <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/6/5071994/samsung-analyst-day-2013-software-investment">Analyst Day</a> gathering today shed some light on the company's future plans, and the display category was highlighted by the promise of 560ppi AMOLED panels for phones. Combine that with the 1440p resolution and you get a 5.2-inch handset &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; the same dimensions as on LG's 1080p G2, but with 78 percent more pixels. And if that's not enough, we're told to look forward to 4K resolutions &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; also known as <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/5/4696770/lg-ultra-reality-uhdtv-viral-video-fake">Ultra HD</a> or 3840 x 2160 &mdash; in 2015.</blockquote></p>
<p>Do we need 2560x1440 on a 5.x-inch smartphone? Of course not. But I'll take it just as long as there's all-day battery life. 4K in 2015? Absolutely. By 2015 we should have a decent amount of 4K content to watch, especially <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2013/11/02/netflix-tests-4k-streaming-launching-in-2014/">if Netflix has its way with 4K streaming</a>.
