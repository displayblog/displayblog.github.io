<blockquote><p>Passengers will eventually be able to read e-books, play games, and watch videos on their devices during all phases of flight, with very limited exceptions. Electronic items, books and magazines, must be held or put in the seat back pocket during the actual takeoff and landing roll.</blockquote></p>
<p>I'm guessing capturing and viewing still images on devices, which you will be holding on to, is okay. Looking forward to a lot of photos taken during takeoff and landing.</p>
