<p>Just a quick note on all the build plans for TFT LCDs in China:</p>
<p>1. Truly Semiconductor G2.5<br />
2. Tianma's G4.5 in Shanghai<br />
3. Additional 60,000 units of G5 glass substrate capacity for IVO<br />
4. Innolux awaiting environmental approval for its G5 fab in Shenzhen<br />
5. Shenzhen Jiulong's G6 fab<br />
6. SVA-NEC's additional G6 fab</p>
<p>Seems like China is poised to become the next super power when it comes to TFT LCD manufacturing: from Japan to South Korea to Taiwan to China. In terms of manufacturing this has been the trend for the last several decades ranging from textile to high-tech electronics. Still, the majority of components that go into the manufacturing of TFT LCDs is held by Japanese companies.</p>
