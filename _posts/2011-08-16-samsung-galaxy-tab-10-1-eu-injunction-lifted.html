<p>Kenny Hemphill, <a href="http://www.macuser.co.uk/5390-samsung-galaxy-tablet-eu-ban-overturned">MacUser UK</a>:</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The injunction was lifted after Samsung complained that the court did not have the authority to issue an injunction on its parent company. The injunction on the German subsidiary remains in place. Samsung&acirc;&euro;&trade;s appeal against the initial ruling, which found that the Galaxy Tab 10.1 had infringed Apple patents, will be heard on 25 August.</p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>I guess Apple will need to litigate in each EU country.</p></p>
