<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/30/asus-announced-padfone/">Engadget</a>: The ASUS Padfone is "an Android smartphone device that comes with a tablet it can dock into." The 4.3-inch smartphone docks into the 10.1-inch tablet. So I am forced to choose between a smartphone and a tablet? Can I use both?</p>

<p>Now I see. The Padfone tablet becomes critical when you run out of batteries on your smartphone. And you can still use it like your smartphone, with a Bluetooth earpiece. Ingenius?</p>

<p>Can you use the Padfone without the smartphone?</p>
<p>Maybe I'm looking at the Padfone all wrong. Maybe I should just look at it as a tablet-like external touch monitor with a built-in battery and dock for an ASUS smartphone. Now that I have a clearler picture of the Padfone in my mind it sounds pretty good.</p>

<p>That magic-like trick was pretty nifty.</p>
