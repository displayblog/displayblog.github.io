<p>Optoma has a 100" 1080p DLP you can install right into your wall. The HDBV3100 will cost $20,000 and you will need to get a separate custom installer to transform your wall from off-white to great color! Considering 100" was reached by LCD and plasma only recently and sell for many multiples, I think Optoma&#39;s solution is not only a great deal, it makes very good use of your really big, but blank, wall. There are smaller (and therefore cheaper) sizes at 90" and 80".</p>
<p>Depth is 30", so your wall will need to be pretty thick. Connections include HDMI, Component, S-Video, VGA and composite. The bezel is customizable to match the color of your wall (or not match).</p>
<p>The display has a contrast ratio of 10,000:1, has an aspect ratio of 16:9, a pixel format of 1920 x 1080, a lamp life of 4,000 hours (not that long, and you&#39;ll need to contact that custom installer again so keep that phone number handy) and it will weigh 750lbs!</p>
