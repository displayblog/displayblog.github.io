<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/5/5175850/hp-chromebook-14-review">David Pierce, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Chromebook 14&acirc;&euro;&trade;s 14-inch, 1366 x 768 display ought to be left in whatever storage bin HP pulled it out of. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s big, but it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not particularly bright and doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have great viewing angles &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; it looks muted and washed out next to the vibrant, colorful Chromebook 11. The bigger problem, though, is that 1366 x 768 is barely acceptable on an 11.6-inch screen, and it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s nearly unusable blown up to 14 inches. At 111 pixels per inch, text becomes blurry and jagged instead of crisp and clear and small icons can be hard to discern. The screen looks like it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s dirty with a sheen obscuring the picture you want to see &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; but it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s just a bad display. It makes the Chromebook 14 feel like a chore to use, not like a laptop I could stare at all day.</blockquote></p>
<p>What good is a notebook if the display sucks? (The same logic applies to smartphones, tablets, real notebooks, monitors, and TVs.) US$299 isn't cheap if junk is what you're getting for it.</p>
