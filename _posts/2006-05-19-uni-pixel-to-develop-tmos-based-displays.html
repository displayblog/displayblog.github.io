<p>Uni-Pixel, the parent company of Uni-Pixel Displays and based in Delaware, and Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) made an anouncement on May 11 that they will collaborate on developing time multiplexed optical shutter (TMOS) technology for displays. TMOS is a patented&nbsp; Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) approach to displays that uses only a single pixel to emit color compared to having separate R-G-B sub-pixel structures normally used in CRT, LCD and plasma displays. The single pixel structure is claimed to allow a decrease in cost of manufacturing in addition to improved power efficiency and image quality. Uni-Pixel is targeting engineering prototypes by Q1&#39;07. Source: <a href="http://sev.prnewswire.com/computer-electronics/20060511/DATH01011052006-1.html">PRNewswire</a></p>
