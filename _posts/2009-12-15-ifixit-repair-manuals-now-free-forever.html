<blockquote>iFixit is one of the most important community-driven technology resources on the net. It is wonderful to now see them build their community by giving back to the community what they community helped build.</blockquote><br />
Those are the words from Lawrence Lessig, founder of Creative Commons and a long-term iFixit user. Kyle Wiens, CEO of iFixit (<a href="http://www.ifixit.com/">www.ifixit.com</a>), just blasted out an email stating that iFixit has all of its repair manuals under the Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license and made it free to the world. iFixit has probably the largest collection of repair manuals for Apple gear:</p>
<ul>
<li>91 Mac models</li>
<li>34 iPods</li>
<li>2 iPhones</li>
<li>154,556 images</li>
<li>1000+ Stey-by-step guides</li><br />
</ul><br />
Why is iFixit giving out all of its treasures free of charge? Kyle weighs in:</p>
<blockquote><p>Because we must. Because the world cannot continue wantonly manufacturing and consuming devices without a plan for their long-term lifecycle. Because individuals need the ability to take control of their devices and their environmental footprint. And because it's the right thing to do.</blockquote><br />
I agree. Make gadgets fixable. I benefited greatly from iFixit with its "<a href="http://www.ifixit.com/iPhone-Parts">iPhone 3G Front Panel Kit</a>" (links to iFixit's iPhone Parts Store) when my iPhone did a face plant on concrete (read, "<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/11/27/apple-is-not-nordstrom/">Apple Is Not Nordstrom</a>" for the story). If I had not fixed it I would have had to spend a considerable sum to purchase another iPhone. Thankfully, and probably because of iFixit-like resources, there is a market for broken iPhones.
