<p>Sharp's D92 series LCD TVs are available in three sizes: 42", 46", 52". All three sport Full HD 1080p capability and has a pixel format of 1920 x 1080. The LCD is based on the company's Advanced Super View (ASV) technology that is a adaption of the base vertically aligned (VA) technology. The backlight has the capability to dim resulting in a dynamic contrast ratio of 15,000:1. Also by using a proprietary coating of the CCFLs, Sharp increased the color gamut. The frequency is doubled from 60Hz to 120Hz to improve motion blur. The D92 series ressponse time is a quick 4ms. Finally, the ASV panel has a 176-degree viewing angle left-right and top-bottom.</p>
<p>The 46" LC46D92U was available in January with a MSRP of $4,999. The 52" LC52D92U has a MSRP of $5,999 and is available. The smallest one of the three, the 42" LC42D92U will be available in April for $3,799.&Acirc;&nbsp; These are not cheap units, but the D92 series do have some advanced technology to significantly improve front screen performance. With fast response times and a doubled-up frequency motion blur should be a minimum for viewing fast-motion videos. Color, via the upgraded CCFL and the dynamic contrast ratio, will have higher fidelity. Good things come at a price and the D92 series LCD TVs from Sharp is a good thing. At least from reading the specifications.</p>
