<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20091228PD212.html">DIGITIMES</a>: Innolux, a Foxconn subsidiary, will be LCD supplier to Apple's rumored tablet. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/12/25/apple-owns-islate-com/">We'll call it iSlate</a>. According to DIGITIMES, the iSlate was delayed because Apple wanted a stronger glass for the 10.1-inch LCD. I'm guessing Corning's Gorilla glass could have helped with that, but no. G-Tech Optoelectronics, a Foxconn subsidiary, will tapped to strengthen the glass. DIGITIMES estimates product introduction in January and volume production in late Q1 or early Q2. And guess who gets to put together the iSlate? Foxconn.</p>
