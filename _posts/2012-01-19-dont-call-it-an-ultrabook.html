<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/01/19/editorial-dont-call-it-an-ultrabook/">Donald Melanson, Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It's not just hype, it's misplaced hype, which may help Intel and computer manufacturers in the short-term, but does little to benefit anyone else. I should note that this is hardly a unique observation on my part -- <em>Gizmodo's</em> Sam Biddle beat me to the punch with a <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5875845/theres-no-such-thing-as-an-ultrabook">similar argument</a> earlier this week, and the general sentiment among many of my colleagues is that the whole notion of Ultrabooks as something new is a little silly.</blockquote></p>
