<p><a href="http://global.samsungtomorrow.com/samsung-electronics-unveils-worlds-first-wireless-mobile-charging-monitor/">SamsungTomorrow</a>: The Samsung SE370 monitor comes in 23.6-inch (S24E370DL) and 27-inch (S27E370DS) sizes. </p>
<p>Rant: Who comes up with model names like this? What is the logic? Is there a school that teaches how to develop names for gadgets so human beings can understand? If such a school exists it should be mandatory for the Samsung folks responsible for these hideous names to attend such a school. Okay, end of rant.</p>
<p>The SE370 series monitor features an industry first: Qi wireless charging. To charge your wireless charge capable smartphone simply put it on the SE370's stand. It's a good idea and helps to declutter your desktop. The wireless charging industry is moving toward a single standard and that should help bring about more gadgets with wireless charging capabilities.</p>
<p>A few specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display: PLS (Plane-to-Line-Switching)</li>
<li>Viewing Angle: 178</li>
<li>Response Time: 4ms</li>
<li>Contrast Ratio: 1000:1 (typical)</li><br />
</ul><br />
The only downside is the pixel format: both sport 1920x1080. The 27-inch version should be 2560x1440.</p>
<p>I like the color (white) and the slim bezel, but the aqua trim is tacky and has to go. A better name would help too.</p>
