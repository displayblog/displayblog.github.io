<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7482 aligncenter" title="HP_Compaq_L2105tm" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/HP_Compaq_L2105tm.jpg" alt="HP_Compaq_L2105tm" width="480" /></p>
<p>The HP Compaq L2105tm is quite unique. The 21.5-inch 1080p LCD monitor offers multitouch! The L2105tm is Microsoft Windows 7 certified and that means it will work right out of the box and connected to a Windows 7 computer. HP is touting that its L2105tm is the first Windows 7 certified monitor. The multitouch monitor is geared toward consumers and the SOHO markets.</p>
<p>The LCD was specified to run 24/7 and has a rated 50,000 hours to half-brightness. The backlight is of the CCFL variety. I had the pleasure of talking to Darryl Valdes, Worldwide Product Marketing Manager for the Displays Commercial Business Segment, and he noted that HP is investigating transitioning toward a LED backlight solution in the future. With a monitor that can run all the time, target markets include: retail POS, vending solution, retail information &amp; interactive, wayfinder applications, etc.</p>
<p>The multitouch technology implemented in the L2105tm is an optical touch solution and includes two cameras, an infrared light and sensor combined with a reflective film to create a light field. When a finger or almost any object creates a shadow as it approaches the display the sensor detects it and relays the information via USB to provide a multitouch experience. The advantage of this type of touch technology is that it is very rugged and you can use a variety of input methods including a gloved finger. Another benefit is good brightness. According to Valdes, the L2105tm has a rated brightness of 250 cd/m2. He also noted that HP is being somewhat conservative with the rating and the actual brightness can reach a typical 270 cd/m2.</p>
<p>Other specs include: 5ms response time, 170/160 viewing angles, 72% NTSC color gamut, 1000:1 contrast ratio, TCO 5.0 Displays compliance, VGA, DVI-D with HDCP connections. A stylus is included.</p>
