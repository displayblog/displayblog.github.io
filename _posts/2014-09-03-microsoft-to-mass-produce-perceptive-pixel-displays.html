<p>Mary Jo Foley, <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/microsoft-gears-up-to-mass-produce-large-screen-touch-displays-7000033257/">ZDNet</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Stephen Elop, Microsoft's Executive Vice President of Devices, told attendees of Microsoft's Australian Partner Conference on September 2 that <a href="http://www.businessspectator.com.au/news/2014/9/3/technology/elop-talks-microsofts-mobile-game-plan">Microsoft was gearing up to &acirc;&euro;&oelig;mass produce&acirc;&euro;¬ù PPI displays</a>. That report comes via The Australian, which reported on Elop&acirc;&euro;&trade;s remarks at the conference. (One of my Twitter contacts, @walksm8, confirmed Elop&acirc;&euro;&trade;s PPI comments.)</blockquote></p>
<p>Perceptive Pixel (PPI) technology is cool and come in two sizes (55 and 82 inches), but only companies with huge IT budgets have been able to afford them so far.</p>
