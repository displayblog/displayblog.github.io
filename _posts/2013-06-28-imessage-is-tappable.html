<p>Julian Sanchez, <a href="http://www.cato.org/blog/untappable-apple-or-dea-disinformation">Cato Institute</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Can you, for instance, log in from a Web browser, reset your password, and then restore your content to a new device? If you can&mdash;and with Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s iCloud services, you can&mdash;then the cloud provider must itself hold the keys to unlock that data. So iMessages may not be interceptable from a suspect&acirc;&euro;&trade;s cell carrier, but Apple has to be capable of handing them over when the authorities come knocking with a warrant.</blockquote></p>
<p>I have thought, up until now, iMessage texts were impervious to NSA's PRISM-like surveillance systems because of its end-to-end encryption scheme. Unfortunately, iMessage texts might be more susceptible than SMS because <em>all</em> iMessage texts are stored on Apple's iCloud servers, indefinitely. On the other hand SMS messages are stored at cellular carriers for only a few days or not at all, a sore point law enforcement has been complaining about for a while.</p>
<p>The option of setting an expiration date for iMessage texts would be a terrific feature for those who value privacy over the convenience of having your entire iMessage text history.</p>
