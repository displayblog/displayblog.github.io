<blockquote><p>Women planning to get a smartphone are more likely to want an iPhone as their next device, with slightly more males preferring Android.</blockquote></p>
<p>I think Android is associated with geeky and that in turn is associated with males. The iPhone seems to be neutral on the whole but attracts those who want something that is simple and elegant in design and easy to use. That's interesting because the iPhone can be harder to use at times.</p>
<p>Take the calendar app for example. You have a calendar on your Mac and a calendar on your iPhone. In order to sync these two calendars you need to do a lot of work: first connect the two with the cable that came with your iPhone, then run iTunes making sure it is set up so that it syncs the calendar, finally you press sync. You're not done yet. You have to disconnect the iPhone in iTunes and then physically disconnect. That's a lot of steps, and a lot more than if you had an Android smartphone.</p>
<p>With an Android smartphone you do nothing: it syncs automatically. Of course you'll need to use Google Calendar on your desktop that you log in with your Gmail account information, but that's about it. How simple is that?</p>
<p>There are rumors that Apple is working on this and in the near future your emails, calendars, contacts, todo lists, notes, etc. will be automatically synced. Until then use this tip:</p>
<p>If you are a Gmail user and added your email account on the iPhone, go to Settings &rarr; Mail, Contacts, Calendars &rarr; Gmail (or whatever you named your Gmail account) &rarr; and make sure to turn on Calendars. The iPhone will ask some questions and when you're done you are now automatically syncing with Google Calendar when you update your Apple Calendar on your iPhone.</p>
<p>Overall the iPhone is easier to figure out how to use than an Android smartphone but Apple needs to improve syncing.</p>
