<blockquote><p>My concern is that 3D may be too much for little eyes. My son turned the 3D all the way down immediately and played the games in 2D mode and I also worry about eye-strain related with the odd need to focus &acirc;&euro;&oelig;inside&acirc;&euro;¬ù the game console. When I lift my head away from the 3DS I actually feel a bit of an blurring after effect when focusing on distant objects, something that may alarm optometrists down the road.</blockquote></p>
<p>This is something that should alarm not just optometrists but <em>everyone</em>.</p>
