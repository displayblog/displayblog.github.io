<p>Tim Culpan, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-08/falling-ipad-mini-demand-to-push-pegatron-electronics-sales-down.html">Bloomberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A decline in revenue from the iPad Mini &acirc;&euro;&oelig;is more on demand, while price has been stable,&acirc;&euro; Pegatron Chief Executive Officer Jason Cheng said. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Not just tablets, also e-books and games consoles, almost every item is moving in a negative direction.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>No CEO of an Apple supplier talks specifics, so <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2013/05/09/apple-ipad-mini-pegatron-bloomberg/">Philip Elmer-Dewitt</a> asked Pegatron CEO Jason Cheng for clarification:</p>
<blockquote><p>"After the meeting, one reporter from Bloomberg approached me, trying to dig out detail numbers about some specific product. I clearly refused to comment on specific products, nor customers, even though he continued with other questions. I did say those words that he quotes me in the article "more on demand, while price has been stable"&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;, "almost every item is moving in a negative direction"&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;; "Not just tablets, also e-books and games consoles". But I did not say anything associated with any specific products.</blockquote></p>
<p>Pegatron CEO Jason Cheng did not say demand for the iPad mini is down.</p>
