<p>Sam Byford, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/17/3515158/htc-shows-off-stunning-5-inch-1080p-j-butterfly-phone-in-japan">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The real attraction, though, is the 5-inch full HD Super LCD 3 screen &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; it's truly a sight to behold. The Super LCD 2 seen in HTC's previous flagship One X was arguably the best panel on the market, but we think its successor is the new champion. Color reproduction is excellent, the 440ppi resolution is astonishing, and the J Butterfly's slightly convex glass makes the image look like it's melting off the side of the phone.</blockquote></p>
<p>4.x-inch 1280x720 smartphones have been bumped down a notch, top-of-the-line specs are now: 5 inches, 1920x1080 pixels, and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2012/10/16/iphone-5-in-cell-touch/">in-cell touch</a> (though I am not sure if the HTC J Butterfly has in-cell touch).</p>
