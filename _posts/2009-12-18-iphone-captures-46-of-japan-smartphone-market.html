<p>According to Impress R&D, a Tokyo, Japan-based market research firm, the iPhone has now captured 46.1% of the domestic smartphone market. The iPhone 3G took 24.6% this year while the updated iPhone 3GS captured 21.5%. The iPhone user base is a solid 3 million in Japan. SoftBank Mobile, who is the iPhone's exclusive carrier, has done a bang-up job of marketing via round-the-clock TV ads, print ads, aggressive pricing, etc. Source: <a href="http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2009/12/17/japans-smartphone-market-the-iphone-is-huge-the-blackberry-and-android-arent/">Mobile Crunch</a></p>
