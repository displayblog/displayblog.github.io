<p>Jeffrey Goldberg, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/10/for-the-first-time-the-tsa-meets-resistance/65390/">The Atlantic</a>, on the TSA's new pat-down procedure that requires meeting resistance, a.k.a your balls:</p>
<blockquote><p>... the obvious goal of the TSA is to make the pat-down embarrassing enough for the average passenger that the vast majority of people will choose high-tech humiliation over the low-tech ball check.</blockquote></p>
<p>That high-tech humiliation involves a back-scatter body imaging device, affectionately called "The Dick-Measuring Device" that sees under your clothing.</p>
<blockquote><p>The machine captures an image of your naked self, including your genitals, and sends the image to an agent in a separate room.</blockquote></p>
<p>What happens when the guys in the separate room <em>thinks</em> they see something?</p>
<blockquote><p>The pat-down, while more effective than previous pat-downs, will not stop dedicated and clever terrorists from smuggling on board small weapons or explosives. When I served as a military policeman in an Israeli army prison, many of the prisoners "bangled" contraband up their asses. I know this not because I checked, but because eventually they told me this when I asked.</blockquote></p>
<p>I'm driving to CES.</p>
