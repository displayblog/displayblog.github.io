<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11683132">BBC</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I maintain you can't do a good conversion of a two-hour movie with high quality in a few weeks like they tried to do with Clash of the Titans.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>You see another stumble with the most recent Harry Potter movie from the same studio making the same mistake - except really getting spanked for it now because they didn't get the film done.</p>
<p>They announced it in 3D - threw a bunch of money trying to convert it to 3D in post-production and it simply didn't work. They just didn't get it done.</blockquote></p>
<p>It's pretty simple and I agree with James Cameron that if you want good quality 3D you should shoot in 3D. I enjoyed watching Avatar in 3D, in the theater. Glasses-free 3D? Cameron says within a decade:</p>
<blockquote><p>Once we get to auto-stereoscopic, that's watching 3-D without glasses, it is going to be the way we watch all of our media. That's probably eight to 10 years away.</blockquote></p>
