One more&Acirc;&nbsp;down.&Acirc;&nbsp;I wrote in <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/09/18/ios-8-iphone-4s/">iOS 8: iPhone 4s</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yesterday I updated my iPhone 4s to iOS 8, and yes there is a negative impact to performance. Not surprising. But what is surprising is that my iPhone 4s is more than usable.</blockquote><br />
The iPhone 4s with iOS 8 is usable, yes. But the performance impact is significant enough that perhaps sticking with iOS 7 might be a good idea for those of us who do not need or want the iOS 8 bells and whistles. If you have an iPhone 4s in all likelihood you are not someone who is into the latest and greatest tech stuff. The security feature where the passcode encrypts the data on your iPhones is in my opinion one of the most important in iOS 8. If that is important to you, I would recommend upgrading to the iPhone 5s. The iPhone 5s is quite a bit more affordable than the new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus&Acirc;&nbsp;and runs iOS 8 without any performance hits at all.</p>
