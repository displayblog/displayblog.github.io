<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-4134 aligncenter" title="philips_cinema_21_9_03" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/philips_cinema_21_9_03.jpg" alt="philips_cinema_21_9_03" width="500" height="286" /></p></p>
<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=philips">Philips</a>' Cinema 21:9 is a unique LCD TV with its ultra-wide aspect ratio of 21:9, hence the name. Until just a couple of days ago, we didn't know how much of a premium that sweet wideness would cost. Now we do: &acirc;&sbquo;&not;4,000. That's about US$5000 for a 56" ultra-wide ultra-unique LCD TV. You still have a bit of time to gather up that amount since the earliest it will ship is June 2009 and that's limited to just Europe. You'll need to save some additional sum to get a roundtrip ticket there as well. There are a lot of other cool pictures of the Cinema 21:9 Press Page (link below).</p>
