<p>Mitsubishi has upscaling technology that takes 1080p content to 4K2K. Exciting! But don't get carried away: Blu-ray content upscaling to 4K2K is not yet. HDMI 1.4 is supported though. Expect future Mitsubishi TVs to sport 4K2K displays and the technology to upscale 1080p to fill all those pixels.
