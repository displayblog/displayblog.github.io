<p>[ <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2016/03/the-9-7-inch-ipad-pro-review-what-makes-something-pro-anyway/">Ars Technica</a> ] Andrew Cunningham:</p>
<blockquote><p>For instance, the screen&rsquo;s DCI P3 color gamut (a feature originally implemented in the most recent 4K and 5K iMacs) means it can display deeper and more accurate shades of green and red, but it&rsquo;s not nearly as impactful as the switch from a non-Retina display to a Retina one or even the switch from the original iPad Air&rsquo;s non-laminated display to the Air 2&rsquo;s laminated one. The screen&rsquo;s brightness goes up to about 500 nits, a nice increase from the 400-or-so nits of the big iPad Pro and the Air 2. However, if you&rsquo;re not outside or in harsh light, you won&rsquo;t need the screen to be quite that bright.</p>
<p>The True Tone feature is subtle but easier to appreciate. The screen has &ldquo;four-channel ambient light sensors&rdquo; that detect not just the brightness of ambient light, but also the color of that light. This subtly changes the display&rsquo;s white point, making it more orangey in warm light and more bluish under cool light. This feature makes the iPad&rsquo;s screen more accurately resemble a sheet of paper.</blockquote></p>
<p>Okay, let's summarize what the 9.7-inch iPad Pro brings to the table:</p>
<ul>
<li>DCI P3 Color Gamut means colors are more accurate. If you're a photographer or a designer who needs color to be accurate, well the 9.7-inch iPad Pro is your best bet when it comes to tablets.</li>
<li>500 nits: We're sometimes in bright environments when we need to use our iPads, and the added brightness of the new smaller iPad Pro will help. Even more than the increased brightness is the 40% reduction of reflectance. Less reflection helps you see the screen better.</li>
<li>True Tone: Now, this is cool. The screen changes colors based on the colors of your environment. It behaves like paper.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Even without the ability to use Apple Pencil, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro's screen has enough improvements to be enticing to those who need a portable color-accurate screen.</p>
