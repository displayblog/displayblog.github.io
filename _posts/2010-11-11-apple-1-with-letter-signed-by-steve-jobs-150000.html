<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1328439/First-Apple-1-sold-Steve-Jobs-sale-150k.html">Mail Online</a>: &Acirc;&pound;150,000 is the price to get your hands on the Apple-1 that comes with a letter signed by Steve Jobs himself. Christie's of London will be doing the honors. FYI, BYOD (bring your own display).</p>
