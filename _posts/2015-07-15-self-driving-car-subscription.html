<p>I don't want to own a car.</p>
<p>Instead, I want a car subscription: 500 miles per month for $50, or unlimited miles for more. I want a self-driving electric car that shows up when I need it. It knows:</p>
<ul>
<li>where I need to be and when,</li>
<li>how cool or warm I like it,</li>
<li>the music I like listening to morning, noon, and night,</li>
<li>whether I like to look outside or not.</li><br />
</ul><br />
And add to that, I don't</p>
<ul>
<li>own it,</li>
<li>fix it,</li>
<li>wash it,</li>
<li>register it,</li>
<li>drive it,</li>
<li>park it,</li>
<li>pay insurance,</li>
<li>worry about running out of electricity.</li><br />
</ul><br />
And all the bad drivers here in Silicon Valley won't piss me off anymore. With a self-driving electric car at my beck and call, I can relax. Getting somewhere will be pleasant again.</p>
