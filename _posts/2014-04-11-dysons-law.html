<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/04/09/dyson-double-research-and-development/">Sir James Dyson</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A company that doesn't double its R&D team every two years, I think, is in trouble.</blockquote></p>
<p>Dyson oversimplified, but his point is valid: If you want to win, aggressively invest in research and development.</p>
