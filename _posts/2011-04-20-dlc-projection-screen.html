<blockquote><p>Only light from the projector is diffused towards observers, and excess external light is reflected away from observers, or it is absorbed, so there is no influence from external light, and the screen can display images to observers with the black solid just the way it is emitted from the projector.</blockquote></p>
<p>Uchida Research Laboratory at Tohoku University demonstrated a projection system based on Diffused Light Control (DLC). A DLC-based projector can be easily seen in brighter environments than your typical projector.</p>
