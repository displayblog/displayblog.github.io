<p>Samsung's new SCH-V940 slider is priced at 627,000 won (a mind numbing US$655!). In South Korea, you don't get a discount by signing up to a 2-year agreement either, like you do in the US. The 627,000 won price what you'll need to pay. Let's see if the sCH-V940 is worth that much...</p>

<p>The SCH-V940 has many features including: 1GB of memory, EV-DO capability, 64-voice polyphonic sound, a MP3 player, 1.3 megapixel camera using CMOS technology, built-in flash, and a TFT LCD display with 240 x 320 resolution. CMOS technology has developed to a point where in certain applications provide better quality than CCD (but I'm a display guy, so what do I know?). So, is all of this worth the price of a budget laptop? I'm sticking to my RAZR.</p>
<p>The "Summer Edition" is available for the SCH-V940 in two colors: White and Orange.</p>
