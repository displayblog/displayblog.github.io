<p><a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/1107/11072510sonydsctx55.asp">DPReview</a>: The DSC-TX55 from Sony sports a 3.3-inch XtraFine OLED touch display. I imagine taking photos on the TX55 will be somewhat similar to an iPhone. The back is pure minimalism.</p>
<p>I think Sony packed too many pixels (16.2 MP) into its backside illuminated Exmor R CMOS image sensor. I'd be excited if the pixels were 30% larger with a 9-MP sensor. Sony claims detail with low noise in photos and videos even in low light conditions. I'm skeptical. And the TX55 captures 1080/60i videos, which is unfortunate. Who wants to deal with interlaced files?</p>
<p>Going back to the OLED display: most of us don't keep point-and-shoot cameras for many years. And maybe that's why it may not become a problem, but OLED displays don't last very long.</p>
<p>My friend who often visits South Korea tells me he sees blue screens on smartphones all over Seoul. Because blue OLEDs die faster than red and green, there is an algorithm that compensates for blue, turning the smartphone OLED display increasingly bluish over time.</p>
<p>I think we use smartphones more than we use digital cameras, so maybe we'll never see blue OLED displays on a TX55. But I am concerned with OLED lifetimes on gadgets I intend to keep for many years.</p>
