<p><img class="size-full wp-image-6318 aligncenter" title="MSI_XSlim_600" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/MSI_XSlim_600.jpg" alt="MSI_XSlim_600" width="480" /></p>
<p>Notebook Italia (<a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fnotebookitalia.it%2Fmsi-xslim-x600-video-presentazione-modelli-prezzi-5774.html&amp;sl=it&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8">translated into English</a>): The MSI X-Slim X600 is a 15.6-inch notebook PC sporting a 1366 x 768 resoluiton, 1.2GHz Intel Celeron or 1.4GHz Intel Core 2 Solo CPU, ATI's Mobility Radeon HD 4330 GPU, HDMI out, and three USB ports. Price? &acirc;&sbquo;&not;799 (about US$1100) and &acirc;&sbquo;&not;949 (about US$1300).</p>
<p>Core 2 Solo? Sounds weak. I would expect a Core 2 Duo. At least! The 1366 x 768 resolution is decent if you want to watch 720p HD video. But then it'll be scaled, which isn't very good. Make sure not to scale it and watch it at 1280 x 720. Trust me, it'll look much better. But if you don't watch a lot of 720p HD (CBS Sports, Fox Sports, ESPN, etc.) and would rather work then just know that MSI gypped you 32 vertical pixels.</p>
<p>I hope MSI used some exotic materials (e.g. aluminum, magnesium, titanium, carbon fiber, etc.) because US$1300 for a 15.6-inch notebook PC is rather expensive, no matter how thin it is. With that kind of money and if all I'm concerned about is thin, I would rather get the new Apple MacBook Air with a proper 1.86GHz Core 2 Duo for just a bit more at $1499.</p>
<p>Overall, I do think MSI has done a fantastic job with the external design of the X-Slim series including the X600, but there are a few things that need to be fixed. CPU is weak: Core 2 Duo please. Second, the price is too high for what it is. And third, I really don't like the off-centered keyboard on the X-Slim X600.</p>
