<p>Sharp was the first to introduce a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=full-hd">Full HD</a> 32" LCD TV with a pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a>. Almost everyone in the display community thought that was overkill. I wonder why. Well, the reasoning was that our visual system couldn't distinguish the increased resolution at the distances that we would be watching a 32" LCD TV. That's probably true. But, there are a lot of folks out there that play Xbox 360, PS3 and PC games on their <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1080p">1080p</a>-capable LCD TVs. And when they do that, my guess is that they play a bit closer to the box than if they were simply watching video. I think 32" LCD TVs with a 1920 x 1080 pixel format will be quite popular.</p>
<p>So, not wanting to be outdone by anyone, Samsung introduced its 32" LCD TV with 1920 x 1080 pixels, the LN32A540. That alone is cool. In addition, the the LN32A540 has a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dynamic-contrast">dynamic contrast</a> ratio of 35,000:1 and great viewing angles of 178/178. The 6ms is on the fast side, but nothing to boast about. The myriad of inputs is great for having multiple video sources, which most of the consumers of the LN32A540 will likely have.</p>
<p>Samsung states on its website that the LN32A540 has a "HD-grade <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1366-x-768">1366 x 768</a> pixel resolution" but in the key specifications area it points to a resolution of 1920 x 1080. The full specifications page reveals a 1920 x 1080 pixel format as well.</p>
