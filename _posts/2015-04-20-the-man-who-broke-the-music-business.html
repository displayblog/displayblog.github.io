<p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/the-man-who-broke-the-music-business">Stephen Witt, The New Yorker</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Glover enjoyed both albums, but he was in an unusual position: he had the power to influence the outcome of this feud. If he leaked &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Graduation&acirc;&euro; and held on to &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Curtis,&acirc;&euro; Kanye might sell fewer records. But if he leaked &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Curtis&acirc;&euro; and held on to &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Graduation&acirc;&euro;&mdash;well, he might make 50 Cent <em>retire</em>.</blockquote></p>
<p>Fascinating article that takes a deep dive into the world of media piracy and a man named Dell Glover who was right in the thick of it.</p>
