<p><a href="http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1686114">Gartner</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>PC shipments in Western Europe totaled 14.7 million units in the first quarter of 2011, a decline of 17.8 percent from the same period in 2010, according to Gartner, Inc.</blockquote></p>
<p>Meike Escherich, principal analyst at Gartner:</p>
<blockquote><p>This quarter&acirc;&euro;&trade;s poor performance was due to excess inventory accumulated at the end of the fourth quarter of 2010 in many countries in Western Europe. The excess inventory was reduced only slightly, as demand came to a standstill. The seasonal growth was also weaker than expected, indicating that the downward trend seen at the end of 2010 continued into the first quarter of 2011.</blockquote></p>
<p>Disposable spending on PCs was down and instead consumers bought tablets. But I thought tablets were considered PCs. Confusing. In the first quarter HP was #1 with 23.4% share, Acer #2 with 19.3%, and #3 was Dell with 9.6%.</p>
