<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Air_New_Zealand_Skycouch.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9251 aligncenter" title="Air_New_Zealand_Skycouch" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Air_New_Zealand_Skycouch.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="341" /></a></p><br />
Air New Zealand has remodeled a Boeing 777 to include 11 rows of Skycouches, which are Recaro-designed cabins that fold flat into a (short) bed. This requires the purchase of the third seat for the couple for an additional 50% of the cost. Not all that bad considering you actually get to sleep on a flat Recaro surface without having to pay for Business or First Class. You'll also be greeted with fairly-large LCDs, power sockets, USB ports and iPod connections in every coach seat. I wish all 777s were outfitted with Skycouches, especially on Singapore Air's SFO to ICN flights.
