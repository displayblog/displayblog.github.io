<blockquote><p>I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d argue smartphones and tablets currently meet most, if not all of those needs; therein lies the problem for Ultrabooks. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not a consumer problem; it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s an Intel problem, as sales of traditional computers are declining, while sales of tablets and smartphones are rising.</blockquote></p>
<p>ARM, is the problem.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/01/ultrabooks/">Ben Brooks</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I actually wonder when the last time a computer manufacturer, not named Apple, gave a damn about making a computer that made lives easier. Think about it: they don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t make the software, just the hardware &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; and yet that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the part that seems like utter crap.</p>
<p>To put it another way: if Apple hadn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t made version 2 of the MacBook Air a wild success, would any other PC manufacturer care to try and make a competing product &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; one that Intel is begging them to make?</p>
<p>I doubt it. And that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the problem.</blockquote></p>
