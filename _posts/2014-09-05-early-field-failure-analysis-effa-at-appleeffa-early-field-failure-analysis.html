<blockquote><p>The idea is to keep easily resolved problems from becoming punch lines for late-night comics. Often, they jury-rig a hardware fix, then coordinate a solution across Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s global supply chain. Sometimes the problems can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be solved quickly &mdash; remember Apple Maps leading people astray. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Every day they don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t recognize a problem, they are potentially manufacturing more bad products,&acirc;&euro;¬ù says Michael Fawkes, the former head of supply chain for Hewlett-Packard. (In his HP job he hired Tara Bunch, now Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s vice president for operations and the head of its returns program.)</blockquote></p>
