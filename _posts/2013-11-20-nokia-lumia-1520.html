<blockquote><p>All of that size isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t for nothing, however, because the 1520 features one of the most beautiful displays on any smartphone. The 6-inch, 1920 x 1080 pixel IPS LCD is bright, crisp, well saturated, and just really nice to look at. Blacks are inky and deep, colors pop with authority, and the vibrant, primary-color-based Windows Phone interface seems to almost leap right off the panel. The screen includes all of Nokia&acirc;&euro;&trade;s exclusive display features, including ClearBlack polarization for great outdoor visibility and super-sensitive touch response that works even through gloves. Companies use frivolous marketing names for various features all the time, so it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s refreshing when one actually relates to real-world improvements. The screen&acirc;&euro;&trade;s pixel density of 367ppi is not as high as other devices, but you can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t see pixels on the 1520 no matter how hard you look, and that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s really all that matters.</blockquote></p>
<p>The vast 6-inch IPS LCD seems wonderful, but the 20 megapixel camera not so much.</p>
