<p>There have been reports that Google Nexus One owners have received Android 2.2 (Froyo) FRF83 updates over the air according to <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/23/nexus-one-getting-android-2-2-frf83-update-over-the-air/">Engadget</a>. Froyo is finally here and that means everything is snappier and you also get Flash 10.1 (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/23/adobe-flash-10-1-player-for-android/">Adobe Flash 10.1 Player For Android</a></em> for more info).</p>
