<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sharp">Sharp</a> is serious about competing in the 32" <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a> space as they have cut prices on 32" LCD TV panels according to DigiTimes who is pointing to panel industry sources in Taiwan. For low-brightness 32" LCD TV panels, Sharp is quoting US$280-290 when typically they go for an average of US$320. My question for DigiTimes is: What is low-brightness?</p>
<p>Lower prices means more sales and that seems to be working for Sharp. In April, 32" LCD TV panel shipments increased to 500K-600K units. In May that number is expected to increase to 800K. Sharp is able to crunch out a whole lot of 32" LCD TV panels using its state-of-the-art <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=g8">G8</a> TFT LCD fabrication plant. I look forward to name brands offering 32" LCD TVs for $499 during this year's gift-giving season. Now that sounds nice.</p>

According to an industry source, Sharp is loading 50% of its G8 capacity with 32" LCD panel production. Because of its low-bright status, I am assuming that most of the cheap (< $300) 32" LCD TV panels will be integrated into LCD TVs that will eventually be sold in China and other developing countries. Also, in discussing the possibility of a $499 32" LCD TV in the near future, because of the tight profit margins already at 32" LCD TV panels that magic retail price of $499 might be difficult to hit. I am still crossing my fingers for major brands to hit $499 with their 32" LCD TV offerings later this year!</p>
