<strong>Symmetrical</strong> The 300 cd/m2 of brightness is fairly standard and should provide enough brightness for most business applications. The static contrast ratio of 1000:1 is excellent while the 3000:1 dynamic contrast ratio means little. The 5ms on/off response time is about average. Because the LA2405wg uses a TN TFT LCD panel... <a id="more"></a><a id="more-7055"></a>the viewing angles are limited to 160/160. But I am glad that the viewing angles are&Acirc;&nbsp;symmetrical, which is important when you pivot the display. Usually I would not recommend pivoting a LCD monitor that makes of a TN LCD panel. I will have to see whether the LA2405wg can be used in portrait mode without a significant loss in clarity in texts and graphics.</p>
<p><strong>Low Power Panel</strong> The LA2405wg uses a low-power LCD panel. Although I am not exactly sure what allows the LCD panel to be low-power, my guess is by improving light transmissivity the number of CCFL tubes were reduced. Light transmissivity was probably improved by using a better optical film stack such as an advanced brightness enhancement film. What is interesting is that even when the LA2405wg is turned off it still consumes a little power of <1 watt. I would like to see this get to zero.</p>
<p>With an Energy Star qualification and an EPEAT Gold rating, the Compaq LA2405wg was designed to be environmentally friendly. The ability to tilt, swivel, rotate and adjust the height allows the business-geared 24-inch LCD monitor from HP to be adjusted to fit you. I think all monitors should be able to tilt, swivel, rotate and be height adjustable.</p>
