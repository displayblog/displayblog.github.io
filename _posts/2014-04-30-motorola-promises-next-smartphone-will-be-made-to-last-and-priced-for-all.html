<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/4/30/5668620/motorola-next-smartphone-launch-event">The Verge</a>: This affordable and durable smartphone will be launching in two weeks on May 13, 2014 in London. The Moto G is already quite affordable starting at US$199 for the 8GB version.</p>
<p>For that price you'd think it's a barely usable smartphone, but it isn't: 4.5-inch 1280x720 display with Corning Gorilla Glass, 5 megapixel camera good for capturing 720p video at 30fps, and powered by a 1.2 GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 SoC. On the software side of things the Moto G runs the latest: Android 4.4 KiKat. The only thing missing is LTE.</p>
<p>Maybe Motorola is working on a more durable, affordable, and a lot faster (LTE) Moto G.</p>
