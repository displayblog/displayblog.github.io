<p><a href="http://dcurt.is/the-management">Dustin Curtis</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Steve Jobs always said his most valuable skill was his ability to recruit. He hired smart people and then gave them "complete autonomy"--his words, in his biography, about Ives--to do their best work. Where the "dictatorial, autocratic asshole" reputation comes from is way later in the process. After the smart people did great work, Jobs criticized them ruthlessly, pushing them to do better. As an administrator should.</blockquote></p>
