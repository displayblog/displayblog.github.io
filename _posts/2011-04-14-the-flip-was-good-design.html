<p>The Ten Commandments of Design by Dieter Rams <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.vitsoe.com/en/gb/about/dieterrams/gooddesign">VITSOE</a>:</p>
<p align="center">
Good design is innovative.<br />
Good design makes a product useful.<br />
Good design is aesthetic.<br />
Good design helps a product to be understood.<br />
Good design is unobtrusive.<br />
Good design is honest.<br />
Good design is durable.<br />
Good design is consistent to the last detail.<br />
Good design is concerned with the environment.<br />
Good design is as little design as possible.<br />
</p></p>
<p>The Flip was extremely simple to use and therefore was tremendously useful. Press the red button and you're off shooting video. Run out of battery in the middle of a town? Run into a store and buy a couple of AA batteries. Better yet, just pack some rechargeable Eneloops.</p>
<p>The ID wasn't drop-dead sexy, but it was utilitarian simple. There was almost nothing that could be misunderstood about the Flip precisely because there was almost nothing you needed to understand. Pick it up, press the red button to record, flip out the USB plug, stick it in your computer to store. The Flip was good design.</p>
