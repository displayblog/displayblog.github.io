<p>Samsung's HL-S4676S SlimDLP, like the name suggests, has a slimmer profile than regular DLP units. According to an article in Engadget, the HL-S4676S 46" DLP is 11.5" thick. They compare it to a 56" unit, which isn't an apples-to-apples comparison: 14.5" vs. 11.5". So, I searched for another 46" DLP unit and came up with Toshiba's 46HM84 (1280 x 720, $795 - $2,477 at Shopzilla.com). Toshiba's 46" DLP had a depth of 15.3". Compared to Samsung's slimmed down HL-S4676S, the Toshiba is down right obese, thicker than Samsung's 56". I went and searched for another  competitor and came up with another Samsung model: HLR4667W, a 46" DLP unit with 1280 x 720 resolution. The skinny on this model: a depth of 19"!!! Although this has not been a thorough investigation (far from), the HL-S4676S SlimDLP does seem to be pretty skinny.</p>

<p>A quick search for "Samsung HL-S4676S" at Shopzilla.com came up with prices ranging from $1,099 to $1,999 at 9 stores. For me, with tax and shipping combined, $1,299.99 was the lowest price. For a 46" DLP, that's a pretty good price! Here are some specifications:</p>
<p>Chip spec: 1280 x 720 DLP<br />
Color: 5 segment color wheel at 14,400 RPM<br />
Speakers: 10W x 2<br />
Ports: HDMI, PC, S-Video, Component Video, USB</p>
