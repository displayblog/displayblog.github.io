<blockquote><p>I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll have a bit more to say about this device next week but, as it stands, the Nook is the best ereader I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve seen so far.</blockquote></p>
<p>Biggs likes, in particular, the IR-based touch that leaves the Pearl E Ink display crystal clear. Touching an ebook is a natural extension and I'm glad the e-reader market is going that direction.</p>
