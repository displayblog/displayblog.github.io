<p><a href="http://blog.laptopmag.com/mini-review-acer-aspire-8920g">Laptop</a>: The first thing that jumped out about Acer's 8920G notebook PC is the use of a 16:9 LCD with a pixel format of 1920x1080, the same that you see on LCD TVs. I believe the 8920G is one of the first notebook PCs to sport a 18.4-inch Full HD LCD. This is somewhat interesting as a 17-inch notebook PC with 1920 x 1200 will give you more pixel real estate. Will most people miss the 120 extra horizontal lines of pixels? Those who arrange dual windows (like I do) when doing work would probably miss them. But I think the 8920G is geared toward the average consumer that browses the Internet, listens to music, watches some movies and works on documents one window at a time. For watching Blu-ray titles that are formatted in 16:9 a LCD with 1920x1080 is perfect. But that's the catch. Most movie titles are not formatted in 16:9. On the other hand, 16:9 would be ideal if you were watching HDTV shows. Unfortunately, I don't think the 8920G has a built-in ATSC receiver.</p>
<p>The 8920G sports the company's Gemstone blue design that mixes blue, black and silver and has a NeoWeave palmrest and touchpad texture. On the left of the keyboard is a touch panel that allows multimedia controls: volume, forward, backward, etc. Often when there is a separate numeric keypad to the right, the keyboard is shifted to the left: a terrible design! Thankfully, the keyboard is centered.</p>
