<p><a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/09/10/Galaxy-Tab-in-my-Pocket">Tim Bray</a> on the Samsung Galaxy Tab:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is an excellent product. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s fast, beautiful, useful, responsive, and convenient. If Samsung picks the right price point and channels, they&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll sell a ton.</blockquote></p>
<p>Bray does mention a design flaw: the four touch buttons. They are hard to find in dim lighting, especially since they are not backlit most of the time. I personally don't like touch buttons and prefer real ones, made for human fingers, like the one on the iPhone and the iPad.</p>
<p>This is what most interested me:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now that I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve gotten used to looking at my pix on the Tab, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not just that the Nexus One looks overexcited, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s that my everyday MacBook looks kind of dingy and inaccurate.</blockquote></p>
<p>First, the Tab uses a fairly high-quality LCD. Second, the Nexus One uses a PenTile Matrix OLED. Third, if Bray is using a non-Pro MacBook the LCD is pretty crappy. I haven't heard of the term 'overexcited' to describe the tendency of OLED displays to show over-saturated colors. I think I'll be using that word from now on.</p>
<p>And then the funniest:</p>
<blockquote><p>Try to take a picture of someone and they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re going to get this alarmed look wondering why a crazy person is waving a big black/white slab at them.</blockquote></p>
