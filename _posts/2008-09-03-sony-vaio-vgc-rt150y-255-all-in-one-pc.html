  <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=imac\">iMac</a> has got
  some competition. Sony has introduced three all-in-one PCs at the CEDIA show that
  is being held in Colorado at the moment. The biggest and baddest all-in-one is Sony's
  RT series and the top-of-the-line RT is the VGC-RT150Y. The VGC-RT150Y packs a huge
  punch in terms of computing power. Just look at the 2.66GHz Core 2 Quad CPU mated
  with 8GB of RAM and a 512MB NVIDIA GeForce 9600M GT GPU. You also get two 500GB
  in RAID 0 formation for a total of 1TB. That's a lot of storage! Personally, I would
  have gone RAID 1 with two 1TB drives. And the feature that really gets me going
  is the huge <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=25.5\"\">25.5\"</a>
  LCD sporting a pixel format of <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1200\">1920
  x 1200</a>. It would have been nice if there were more pixels, but I'd guess
  you'll need to pack in a 30\" for that! "

<p>The integrated <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=blu-ray">Blu-ray</a> optical drive is a monster. You can throw anything at it and it'll be able to read and write without a hiccup, at least that's what I'm assuming according to the really long list of supported optical disk types. Not only can you watch Blu-ray movies in all its glory, the integrated ATSC tuner will pump in HD signals straight to the monstrous 25.5" LCD. The 25.5" size is large enough to be your personal LCD TV and that's probably what Sony was shooting for.</p>
<p>There are some nifty little buttons on the right side of the all-in-one. There is a "Display Off" button for when you want to keep the machine running but turn the display off. As I'm writing this, I'm thinking, "Isn't there a power profile on Vista where the software controls that?" Maybe I'm missing something. There's a "HDMI Select" button and a wireless on/off switch. There's also a 'Connect' button that is probably used to connect the wireless keyboard and mouse, but it's just a guess. I really like the keyboard with the built-in trackpad to the right. Of course, if you're a lefty, you're out of luck.</p>
<p>The VGC-RT150Y's design is more robust-looking that the current iMac all-in-ones but doesn't look as sexy. You're pick: robust or sexy. I personally like the VGC-RT150Y's design quite a bit. And as far as I can tell, it packs the largest LCD in an all-in-one. Maybe Apple will introduce something even larger next week. Maybe.</p>
