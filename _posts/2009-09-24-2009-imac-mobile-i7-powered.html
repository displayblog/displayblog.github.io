<p><strong>17-inch iMac?</strong> I think there is room for a cheaper iMac. The cheapest notebook PC is the white <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=macbook&amp;sa=Search#1348">MacBook</a> at just $999. That price is considered a magic retail price point where sales increase much more than expected compared to a price a little above it such as $1099. With a $999 priced iMac, Apple can expect a substantial increase in sales for the iMac line. For Apple to get to a $999 price point on an iMac, I think it will need to get down to a 17-inch version with a decently-powered Core 2 Duo, instead of the Mobile i7.</p>
<p><strong>Upgrades</strong> The 20-inch and 24-inch iMacs will most likely sport the new Mobile i7 CPUs. The 20-inch will probably feature the low-end (but still blazingly fast) 1.6GHz 720QM while the 24-inch version will get the faster 1.73GHz and 2.0GHz versions.</p>
<p><strong>No Gut</strong> If you compare the 24-inch <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=led+cinema+display&amp;sa=Search#1410">LED Cinema Display</a> to the current iMacs there is one glaring difference: the gut underneath the iMacs. I think it is time to let it go. I have shared with you that <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/09/22/2010-iphone-5-megapixel-1080p-30fps-video-recording/">I am not a real fan of tapered designs</a>. If you look at the iMac from the side the back is tapered for no functional real reason since most of us don't look from the side. Of course the design does give you the illusion that it is thinner. But the tapered design takes away a lot of internal space. I bet Apple could use a non-tapered design and actually reduce the overall thickness of the iMac. I can also imagine Apple pushing the internals up so that all you see is the display from the front, just like the LED Cinema Display.</p>
