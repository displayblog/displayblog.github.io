<blockquote><p>Often I find myself longing for a simpler life, a life that might be harder - like those of my grandparents and parents - but a life that was simpler. People didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t buy disposable, people bought quality when possible.</blockquote></p>
<p>Quality, if at all possible, is the way to go. Spending more now for quality will save you money and time in the long run.</p>
