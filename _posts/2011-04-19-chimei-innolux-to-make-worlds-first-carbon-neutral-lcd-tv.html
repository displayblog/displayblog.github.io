<blockquote><p>Chimei Innolux (CMI) has announced on the eve of Earth Day its collaboration with the CHIMEI brand to introduce carbon-neutral LCD TVs by the end of the year, demonstrating CMI's continuous CO2 reduction efforts in line with the green consumer demands. CMI also hopes to encourage more manufacturers to shift to green production and design through consumer support.</blockquote></p>
<p>Good for CMI. Good for us. Of course, not buying and not watching TV at all would be best.</p>
