<p>[ <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/9887/lenovo-launches-thinkpad-x1-yoga-at-ces-with-oled-display">AnandTech</a> ]&nbsp;The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga is the first OLED laptop, a convertible one.&nbsp;The 14-inch OLED display is supplied by Samsung and sports a 2560x1440 pixel format. A 2560x1440 IPS LCD is an option. Samsung seems to be&nbsp;getting better at making OLED displays bigger: from&nbsp;5.7-inch OLED displays used for the upcoming <a href="http://displayblog.com/2016/01/04/samsung-galaxy-s7-and-s7-edge/">Galaxy S7 Edge</a> and current Notes, and an&nbsp;8-inch on the Galaxy Tab S2, to now 14 inches. I am&nbsp;concerned&nbsp;though.</p>
<p>Apps like Microsoft Word&nbsp;have a lot of white, so do many websites. OLED displays will consume way more energy than LCDs. On the other hand, if you're watching video OLED has the upper hand because video is generally darker. My recommendation is to set a dark theme on Windows to extend battery life.&nbsp;I wonder how long the X1 Yoga will last if you're working on it most of the time.</p>
<p>The keyboard is water resistant and both the keyboard and TrackPoint retracts when the display is rotated around, a nifty trick that makes using the Yoga as a tablet a bit more comfortable. The ThinkPad X1 Yoga ships this month, but you'll have to wait until April for the OLED version. Price starts at US$1449.</p>
