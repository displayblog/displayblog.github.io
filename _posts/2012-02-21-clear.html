<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/02/21/clear">John Gruber</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>My cardinal rule of to-do list apps is that priority should be implicit by task order. Drag more important/urgent items up, drag less import/urgent items down. Clear gets this right. Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Reminders app gets this completely wrong.</blockquote></p>
<p>I get what Gruber is saying, but what do you do with important items that are not urgent?</p>
