<p>Michael Zhang, <a href="http://www.petapixel.com/2013/02/05/panasonic-doubles-color-sensitivity-in-sensors-with-micro-color-splitters">PetaPixel</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Panasonic&acirc;&euro;&trade;s new Micro Color Splitters are an alternative to these color filters. Instead of <em>filtering out</em> light, the splitters act as tiny prisms to split the incoming light into red, green, and blue light onto multiple pixels on the sensor. Color information is still captured, just as with CFAs, but a theoretical <em>100% of light</em> is directed onto the sensor.</blockquote></p>
<p>Most new technologies fail to make it to market because they are not compatible with today's underlying manufacturing infrastructure or it takes too long or costs too much to change it. I believe Panasonic's Micro Color Splitters have a good chance of being integrated into next generation cameras and smartphones soon because these can simply replace color filter arrays in existing image sensor solutions. I'm looking forward to better low light photography.</p>
