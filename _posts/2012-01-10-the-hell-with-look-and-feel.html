<blockquote><p>Technology and lovely design are now inseparable, and Jobs can take much of the credit. I used to see Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s devoted fans as cultish, but now I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m the one who&acirc;&euro;&trade;s left in a cult: the shrinking cult of technophiles who want stuff that above all works well, solves problems, and delivers real value, and the hell with look and feel. I sound paleontological even saying it.</blockquote></p>
<p>I thought maybe this article was written a while ago. Because it was a long time ago, up until mid-1998, when Apple made overpriced products that didn't work well, and subscribed to a paleontological world view that led to products that looked like hell.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1665795/silicon-valleys-new-secret-weapon-designers-who-found-startups">Enrique Allen</a> created the <a href="http://designerfund.com/">Designer Fund</a>, a fund specializing in designer founders. Look and feel is becoming even more important in developing products that works really well, for people, who see things and feel things.</p>
