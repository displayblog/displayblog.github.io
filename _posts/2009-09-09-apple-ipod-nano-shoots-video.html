<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="size-full wp-image-6930 aligncenter" title="Apple_iPod_nano_Video" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Apple_iPod_nano_Video.jpg" alt="Apple_iPod_nano_Video" width="728" height="335" />Apple unveiled the new <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=ipod+nano&amp;sa=Search#1348">iPod nano</a> with upgraded capacities: 8GB and 16GB. Major new features include a video camera that can store H.264 video with a 640 x 480 at 30fps resolution and a larger 2.2-inch LCD with a 240 x 376 resolution (204 PPI).&Acirc;&nbsp; I'm not sure if you can use this video camera to take pictures. I'm guessing it does but there is no mention of it on <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/">Apple's iPod nano site</a>. Other things that are new:</p></p>
<ul>
<li>Polished anodized aluminum finish</li>
<li>FM Tuner</li>
<li>Nine colors: Pink, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Grey, Silver</li>
<li>iTunes Tagging: Use the click wheel to tag the song and iTunes creates a list of all your tagged songs so you can preview or purchase them when you sync.</li>
<li>Live Pause: Want to pause the radio? Now you can. Rewind live radio? Sure, up to 15 minutes.</li>
<li>VoiceOver: Tells you the title and artist when you click the click wheel or on the new earphones with the controls and mic.</li>
<li>Voice Memos: There's a built-in mic, of course, so you can record voice memos now.</li>
<li>Pedometer: Uses the built-in accelerometer to act as a pedometer and works with the Nike+ iPod Sport Kit.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If the iPod nano can only take videos, this is an interesting development. The nano can take videos but not pictures. The iPod touch can take pictures but not videos. The iPhone 3G can take pictures but not videos and the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=iphone+3gs&amp;sa=Search#1348">3GS</a> can take both pictures and videos. I'm guessing that soon enough Apple will make it so that all the next-generation iPod nano and iPod touch devices will be able to take photos and videos.</p></p>
