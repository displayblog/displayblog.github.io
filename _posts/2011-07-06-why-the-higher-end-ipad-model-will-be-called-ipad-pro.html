<p>A redefinition of Pro by <a href="http://kensegall.com/blog/2011/06/apple-revising-the-definition-of-pro/">Ken Segall</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the world of Apple, a Pro product used to mean &acirc;&euro;&oelig;designed for high-end professionals with needs far beyond those of mortal men.&acirc;&euro; Now it simply means &acirc;&euro;&oelig;the high-performance model.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple is deliberately refocusing on the millions who are not professionals but want high-performance models.</p>
<p>Neil Hughes at <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/07/06/rumor_apple_may_release_ipad_2_plus_with_high_res_display_this_year.html">AppleInsider</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If Apple does release a new iPad this year, it will be a high-end model with a greater pixel density display rather than an entirely new third-generation model, according to a new report.</blockquote></p>
<p>FBR Capital Markets analyst Craig Berger called an overseas company involved in Apple's supply chain and heard there could be an "iPad 2 Plus" later this year. The resolution would be in the 250 to 300 range.</p>
<p>To be branded Retina Display the iPad's display only needs 263 ppi. The definition of Retina Display depends on only one thing: when do the pixels disappear? At 18 inches, which is the average usage distance of the iPad, 263-ppi pixels disappear. So the resolution range given to Berger sounds right to me. For an in-depth look into a 263-ppi 9.7-inch IPS LCD Retina Display read <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/01/23/ipad-retina-display/"><em>iPad & Retina Display</em></a> and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/12/01/ipad-2-0-gets-retina-display/"><em>iPad 2.0 Gets Retina Display?</em></a>.</p>
<p>This new high-end model will be called iPad Pro, not iPad 2 Plus. Why? Well, first Apple isn't Samsung. The company doesn't add prefixes and suffixes except for 'i' and 'Pro'.* This next iPad looks to be a higher-performance model than the current iPad 2 and by that very definition it falls neatly into the Pro category. In <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/06/09/ipad-pro/"><em>iPad Pro</em></a> I go into a few more reasons why I think the next iPad will be called iPad Pro.</p>
<p>* What I want to write, and what I end up writing are too often completely different. After <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/07/11/ipad-pro">John Gruber</a> linked to this post, I received emails pointing out the fact that Apple uses many other suffixes. Of course, they were right, and I was wrong.</p>
