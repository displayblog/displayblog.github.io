<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dell">Dell</a>'s <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=27"">27"</a> UltraSharp 2709W <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-monitor">LCD monitor</a> is a handsome unit. Although simple in design, the overall look is quite elegant, in a mechanical way (versus a fluid way). The 27" LCD monitor sports the same pixel format (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1200">1920 x 1200</a>) as smaller <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=24"">24"</a> LCD monitors so you won't get more screen real estate, just bigger fonts and icons. If you want to be nice to your eyes, the 2709W should be better than the smaller 24" cousins in the sense that it will be easier to read.</p>

<p>Ports galore! You can connect just about anything to the 2709W. Although it might be unfair to compare it to a LCD TV, with the 27" size a lot of folks will be using this as a pseudo-TV. So, the question is: where are the additional HDMI ports? Yes, I know, unfair, but hopefully Dell will see that an additional one or two HDMI ports would make a lot of folks happy. Bear in mind Dell's newest UltraSharp LCD monitors are the few that sport a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=displayport">DisplayPort</a>, uh, port.</p>

<p>Take a look at the stand. It is a fairly good-looking design. The 2709W is heigh-adjustable and as far as I can tell, rotatable. Other specifications that pop out are:</p>
<p><strong>110% NTSC Color Gamut</strong>: This should bode well for folks that work with color. Make sure to color correct this monitor before you start working!</p>
<p><strong>Premium Panel Guarantee</strong>: Dell has this guarantee for all of its UltraSharp LCD monitors, but it is good to know that even if you have a single pixel defect, Dell's got your back.</p>
<p>Now for the kicker: the price of $999. That's a bit much in my opinion, especially in light of the previous version, the UltraSharp 2707WFP, going at just $799.00. The main difference is that the new 2709W has better contrast ratio (3000:1 vs 1000:1), wider color gamut (110% vs 92%), and has DisplayPort. The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dynamic-contrast">dynamic contrast</a> ratio of 3000:1 should come in handy if you are watching HD video content. If those features are important as well as the new design, maybe the $200 premium is worth it.</p>
