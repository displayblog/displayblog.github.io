<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Accelerated Flash</strong> Like Hulu? You'll like the elan! With NVIDIA's Tegra all Flash-based content is hardware accelerated including 720p HD content. This is big news. How about we get hardware-accelerated Flash on everything else!</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Silent</strong> Because the Tegra chipset consumes so little power it doesn't need a fan. So this little elan netbook will be quiet. It doesn't say in the press release but I'm assuming the elan makes use of SSD, so quiet isn't the right word--silent is.</p></p>
