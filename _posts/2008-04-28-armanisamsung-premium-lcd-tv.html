<p>Inspired by Giorgio Armani's new 2008/09 Armani/Casa home furnishings collection, the Armani/<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=samsung">Samsung</a> Premium <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a> was designed for "a discriminating consumer" that seeks a "sophisticated design and leading flat screen technology".</p>
<p>The Armani/Samsung Premium LCD TV does look handsome. The simple and elegant design is something that I like in high-tech products. But there are some problems. In my opinion, the LCD TV looks a bit fat. In today's ultra-competitive TV industry, slim is in and ultra-slim will be in very soon. I would recommend losing about 50% of its depth.</p>
<p>There isn't much technical information available, but since this LCD TV is geared toward the discriminating consumer, I would hope it has a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led-backlight">LED backlight</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=%22local+dimming%22">local dimming</a> enabled), an incredible contrast ratio, an enhanced color gamut and ambient light sensing capability that automatically adjusts brightness for optimum viewing. Just to name a few.</p>
