<p><a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1552678&highlight=">Amazon</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Amazon today announced Kindle Library Lending, a new feature launching later this year that will allow Kindle customers to borrow Kindle books from over 11,000 libraries in the United States. Kindle Library Lending will be available for all generations of Kindle devices and free Kindle reading apps.</blockquote></p>
<p>I've been waiting for this. I purchase few books preferring to borrow them from public libraries. I don't own a Kindle but in a pinch the Kindle app on my iPhone should work. But for books that I'd like to enjoy I think I'll be seriously considering the purchase of a Kindle. From my brief testing, reading on the Kindle's electrophoretic display is much more pleasant than on even the best IPS LCD.</p>
