<p>Sound it out: "So sue me." Get the story behind how the sound got its name. Jim Reekes worked at Apple for over 12 years and is the person responsible for many sounds on the the Mac, including the startup sound. Excellent interview: <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/02/26/reekes">the video</a>. (I would rate the video PG-13 for a few strong words.) <em>via</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/02/26/reekes">Daring Fireball</a></p>
