<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/specs.html">Apple</a> almost always does a fantastic job of bringing together color, music and design into a seemless presentation and an almost ethereal experience. The new iPod nano is a case in point. Nine different colors. An iconic portable music device. An incredibly thin and beautiful design. I won't bore you with all the details since there are many other sites that have a tremendous amount of information and even a hands-on review. I'll stick to displays. As Steve Jobs mentioned, this is the same size as the previous generation iPod nano, but rotated. The 2-inch TFT LCD has a blue-white LED backlight and sports a pixel format of 240x320 or QVGA. With the built-in accelerometer the LCD auto-rotates and can be viewed in landscape mode, 320x240. Quite nice.</p>
