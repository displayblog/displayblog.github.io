<p>Finally, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=apple&amp;sa=Search#1514">Apple</a> is giving you the option of paying US$50 to get an "Antiglare Widescreen Display" for the 15-inch unibody <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=macbook+pro&amp;sa=Search#1545">MacBook Pro</a>. Yesterday, I visited an Apple Store to check out the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=iphone+3gs&amp;sa=Search#1542">iPhone 3GS</a>' picture and video-taking capabilities. Let's just say I wasn't impressed with the selectable autofocus--I didn't really see a single picture with nice bokeh after taking a dozen pictures. I did like the video--very impressive for a phone. After fiddling with the iPhone I went to the MacBook section and toyed with the 17-inch MacBook Pro with the antiglare option. The antiglare display is nice and significantly reduces reflections and glare. The aluminum-like bezel looks pretty ugly though next to an edge-to-edge cover glassed version. So I was wondering: Why can't Apple (or Corning) coat the cover glass with an antiglare treatment?</p>
<p>I'm also wondering if we're being ripped off. Do you remember when everyone was charging $50 for the optional <em>glare</em> display?</p>
