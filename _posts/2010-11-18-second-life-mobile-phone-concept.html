<p><a href="http://www.yankodesign.com/2010/11/17/i-can-see-through-your-juice/">Yanko Design</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>... the phone incorporates a double display. When in active use the AMOLED screen powers up in all glory and in standby mode the E-ink display gets active. This essentially means that the E-ink uses very little energy and the degree of transparency of the display shows how much battery is remaining. The more transparent the display, the less battery remaining.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Second Life Mobile Phone Concept is a neat but with current technology is probably not possible. The transparent OLED display is already here and was demonstrated by Samsung. But an E Ink display, the way it currently works, cannot be transparent.</p>
<p>Another difficult, if not impossible, challenge for this type of design would be the battery: where could it be housed? If you look at the most advanced mobile devices the largest component is usually the battery. Unless there is a revolutionary advancement in battery technology, much space will be required for batteries powerful enough for a mobile device like a smartphone.</p>
<p>There are transparent glass with embedded solar cells, which can generate some power; the amount of electricity will most likely not be enough to support a smartphone but maybe something extremely simple like John's Phone. The bottom portion to the left and right of the button doesn't seem to be used for anything. Maybe a small battery and other electronics can be housed there.</p>
<p>Photo sensors can also be integrated into the display itself so a separate camera module that uses the typical lens + image sensor might not be necessary in the near future. A transparent phone is certainly possible but will most likely need to be a very simple phone that uses very little power.</p>
