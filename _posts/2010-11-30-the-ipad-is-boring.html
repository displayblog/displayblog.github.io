<p><a href="http://community.winsupersite.com/blogs/paul/archive/2010/11/29/120583.aspx">Paul Thurrott</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The New York Times <strong>asks</strong>, "With so much going for them why, eight months after the iPad's release, is the design of so many of those apps so boring?"</p>
<p>To which I answer: They're boring because <strong>the iPad is boring</strong>.</blockquote></p>
<p>The New York Times article that Thurrott is quoting: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/29/arts/29iht-design29.html">On an Innovative Device, Apps Lack Imagination</a>. The new <em>Project</em> iPad e-magazine seems imaginative and far from boring.</p>
