<p>AUO will be showcasing other LCDs such as an ultra-thin 1.9" TFT LCD that's just 0.63mm thick and a 1.8" TFT LCD that has <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=multitouch">multi-touch</a> capability integrated into the glass. Typically, touch capability is added onto a LCD by adding an additional layer of film.</p>
