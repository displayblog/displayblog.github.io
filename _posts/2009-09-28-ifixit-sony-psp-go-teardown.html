<p>The folks over at iFixit has completed a teardown of Sony's <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22psp+go%22&amp;sa=Search">PSP Go</a>. Of course, I'm interested in the LCD and related parts--there isn't a whole lot of information but I'll see if I can find out more. During the teardown, iFixit had a whoops moment and accidentally separated the backlight unit from the LCD! I wonder if the LCD worked after they put it back together. I would think it should be a bit more difficult to separate the backlight unit from the LCD: whoever was the LCD module assembler should do a tighter job next time. The LCD controller for the video out is Sharp's 0923 7y LR388G1. I googled it to no avail. Just a few words on the LCD: The 16:9 3.8-inch LCD in the PSP Go is a bit smaller than the 4.3-inch ones in previous PSP models. The resolution is the same at <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=480+x+272&amp;sa=Search">480 x 272</a>.</p>
