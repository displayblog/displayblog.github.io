<p>Darren Murph at <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/04/13/kyocera-echo-review/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There's no question that Kyocera has cooked up something fancy to make two panels work in conjunction, and the Tablet Mode Extension app is largely to thank, but outside of <em>seeing</em> Android work across two screens, you aren't apt to notice any irregularities. And that, friends, is impressive.</blockquote></p>
<p>This is the type of hardware advancements that you are able to see on a generally open platform like Android. For a displays guy like me having twice the screen real estate on a small smartphone is very exciting. Kyocera's execution of integrating unique hardware to Android is superb.</p>
<blockquote><p>Truth be told, the extended 960 x 800 screen resolution isn't too far off from the 1024 x 600 found on the Galaxy Tab (or the 1024 x 768 on the iPad), so you definitely encroach "tablet" territory when viewing these programs across two panes. To say it's a refreshing new look would be understating it; after a week of use, peeking TweetCaster on our Nexus One felt like a true step back from a visibility standpoint.</blockquote></p>
<p>Refreshing indeed. Dual 800x480 LCDs will certainly get close to the pixel format of some tablets, but in a much smaller and lighter chassis. What I'd like to see is the bezel between the two LCDs shrink in a future version. Kudos to Kyocera for building something unique in a world of me-too smartphones. You really have to see the Kyocera Echo in motion so check out the hands-on video at Engadget.</p>
