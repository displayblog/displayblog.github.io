<p>Samsung announced its S3 on April 30, 2008. The cute little S3 portable media player from Samsung has a lot of functions packed into it. The dimensions of the S3 is 95mm x 44mm x 9.8mm and only weighs 53g. Some of the features include a FM radio (and recording), a text viewer, photo viewer, games, a screen savor and something called dynamic LED lighting. The LED lighting effect is linked rhythmically to the on-screen images and provides for a fusion of listening to and looking at music. Samsung's Digital Natural Sound ending (DNSe 2.0) makes the audio sound good.</p>
<p>These little players shouldn't be called digital audio players (DAPs) because they do so much more than play digital audio. I prefer to call these portable media players because one they are portable and two they play all sorts of media.</p>
