<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=samsung">Samsung</a> Electronics America, a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics Corporation, showcased its SyncMaster 2493HM 24" <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-monitor">LCD monitor</a> and its slightly larger sibling, the 25.5" SyncMaster 2693HM at Macworld.</p>
<p>Just a quick comment on the 25.5" monitor: couldn't they simply make it 26"? The model name suggests that the monitor is 26" but in fact it is 25.5". This might be confusing to the customer.</p>
<p>Unlike the slim LCD TVs that I saw at CES, most 24" LCD monitors continue to be rather chunky. The 2493HM is no exception. (The Samsung link below will take you to the 2493HM page where you can view the monitor at different angles.) I am willing to guess that this 24" is thicker than some 42" <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a>s that I saw. Why is that?</p>
<p>The design is plain, which is nice. It doesn't provoke a "Wow!" reaction. One of the best designs I have seen (aside from <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=apple">Apple</a>'s Cinema Displays) are monitors from HP. But I digress. The 2493HM has a feature that did wow me and that's the dynamic contrast ratio of 10,000:1. That is very very good. I am not completely sure how this is achieved, but from the looks of it, the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=ccfl">CCFL</a>-based backlights are being modulated to be in sync, in terms of brightness, with the video that is being displayed.</p>
<p><strike>The HDMI input might be nice but, with just one, is simply not enough. If you bought this as your main display for your PC, then you'll be making use of that <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=hdmi">HDMI</a> port (with a HDMI-to-DVI cable). If you want to connect your PlayStation 3, you'll either need to disconnect your PC or get a HDMI hub, an additional cost. </strike></p>
<p>(Update 2008.03.16) A comment came in saying that the 2493HM has both VGA and DVI ports in addition to HDMI, so I checked it out on <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/consumer/detail/spec.do?group=computersperipherals&amp;type=monitors&amp;subtype=lcd&amp;model_cd=LS24KIEEFV/XAA&amp;fullspec=F">Samsung's site</a>. And yes, the 2493HM has all three connectors. So you can use it for your PS3, PC and then some. Thanks for the comment!</p>
<p>Pay close attention to the viewing angle. It is just 160/160. What that tells me is that this monitor uses a TN panel, an inferior technology to Patterned Vertical Alignment (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=pva">PVA</a>) that Samsung uses for its more advanced models. I don't particularly like spending $600 for a TN display and I recommend you don't either.</p>
<p>All in all, this seems to be a OK display with ho-hum looks and general features with just one great feature: its <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dynamic-contrast">dynamic contrast</a> ratio of 10,000:1.</p>
