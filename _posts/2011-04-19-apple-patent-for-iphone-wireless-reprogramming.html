<blockquote><p>Apple could be preparing to make switching your iPhone from one carrier to another easier though, as a recent patent awarded to them details a method in which Apple could wirelessly and remotely reprogram iPhones to work on different carriers.</blockquote></p>
<p>The carriers still hold to much power over the consumer. They bait us with low phone prices and then milk us for two years. You want out? They have a huge ETF around our necks, just for that. Apple has been awarded a patent that allows for wireless reprogramming of iPhones to work on different carriers. Don't know if or when this patent will get used, but I hope it's soon.</p>
