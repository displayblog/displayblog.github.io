excerpt: '<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=funai">Funai</a>
  Electric Advanced Applied Technology Research Institute (phew, that was long!) has
  developed a new display technology that it is calling Dynamic ECD. Dynamic ECD is
  a reflective display that does not require a backlight to light up. Instead of a
  backlight it uses ambient light. The limitations of reflective displays was that
  they tended to lack brightness due to poor reflectivity. There has been advances
  in this regard such as <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=qualcomm">Qualcomm</a>''s
  MEMS technology but generally has not garnered much excitement from consumers. Maybe
  we''re just spoiled by high-end LCDs and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=oled">OLED</a>s.
  Funai wants to change that. '

<p>The Dynamic ECD display has a reflectivity of 80%,much higher than reflective LCDs. Color changes occur when electricity is passed through. A big advantage is that it sips electricity: power consumption is rated at just 0.16mW per cm2 or just 1% of typical LCDs. The Dynamic ECD packs a final punch: because it does not require a backlight that usually comprises about 30% of the cost of a typical LCD, manufacturing the Dynamic ECD will be roughly 30% less. Funai expects to commercialize the Dynamic ECD display in 2009 and will be geared toward portable electronics such as mobile phones, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=ebook">ebook</a> readers, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=pmp">PMP</a>s, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=mid">MID</a>s, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=umpc">UMPC</a>s, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=netbook">netbook</a>s, etc. with <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=7"">7"</a> to <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=14"">14"</a> sizes.</p>
