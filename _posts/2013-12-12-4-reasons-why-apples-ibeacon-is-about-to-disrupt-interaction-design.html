<blockquote><p>You step inside Walmart and your shopping list is transformed into a personalized map, showing you the deals that&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll appeal to you most. You pause in front of a concert poster on the street, pull out your phone, and you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re greeted with an option to buy tickets with a single tap. You go to your local watering hole, have a round of drinks, and just leave, having paid&mdash;and tipped!&mdash;with Uber-like ease. Welcome to the world of iBeacon.</blockquote></p>
<p>Looking forward to this future.</p>
