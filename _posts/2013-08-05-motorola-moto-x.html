<p>The Motorola Moto X sports a 4.7-inch OLED display with RGB sub-pixels, a good choice. But at US$199 with a two-year contract, the same price as the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2013/03/14/samsung-galaxy-s4/">Samsung Galaxy S4</a> and the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2013/02/28/htc-one/">HTC One</a>, the Moto X is too expensive.</p>
<p><em>Update 2013.11.12:</em> The price came down to $99 with a two-year contract, but that might not have helped much. <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/11/11/motorola-plans-low-cost-phone/">Rolfe Winkler and Ryan Knutson, The Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to research firm Strategy Analytics, roughly 500,000 Moto X phones were sold in the third quarter, after the phone was released in August. By comparison, Samsung said it sold <a href="http://www.samsungmobilepress.com/2013/05/23/Samsung-GALAXY-S4-Hits-10-Million-Milestone-in-First-Month-1">more than 10 million</a> Galaxy S4 phones within a month of its April release.</blockquote></p>
<p>Strategy Analytics states in terms of shipments Motorola captured less than 2% of worldwide smartphones in the third quarter. To me shipment market share doesn't mean much. Two percent, five percent, fifteen percent... who cares. The one important question should be: Is Motorola generating profits?</p>
<p>The number of smartphones Motorola is working has been reduced, and that's a good thing because now Motorola might have a chance at making smartphones that matter. To have a better chance at making profits Motorola needs to pair down the number of models to just one, or two. No one seems to get this except for Apple. Unfortunately Motorola doesn't get it either: There are rumors of yet another Motorola-branded smartphone called the Moto G, which will be cheaper. I can just hear the the brasses at smartphone brands calling for more smartphones and for more cheap smartphones. For what? To capture shipment market share? And then what? Here's an idea: How about focusing on generating profits by making a one or two great smartphones. Apple seems to be doing quite well with that strategy.</p>
