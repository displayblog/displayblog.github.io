<p><a href="http://en.akihabaranews.com/73220/review/review-panasonic-gh2-an-impressive-upgrade">Akihabara News</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Another huge improvement with the GH2 is its new Touchscreen, allowing you to quickly adjust where your camera needs to focus by touching a subject directly on the screen. Already available on the G2, this option is another good move by Panasonic. A welcome upgrade indeed, but not as great as Panasonic&acirc;&euro;&trade;s truly magnificent new LCD! Our Camera is featuring a sharper LCD also offering en extended color gamut up to 25% compared to the GH1, making it easier to get the correct manual focus when shooting video for example. This &acirc;&euro;&oelig;sharper&acirc;&euro;¬ù LCD also allows Panasonic to bring more information (UI) onto the screen when shooting picture, once again a welcome move here as well from Panasonic.</blockquote></p>
<p>Touch-based focus can be quite helpful in many situations and I would like to see other camera brands incorporate this technology into their cameras. I'm looking at you Sony; hopefully the next NEX will have this feature.</p>

<p>The LCD has been enhanced. Only size and pixel format at 3-inch and 460,000 dots are similar to the one used in the GH1. Maybe the color filter and/or the backlight was enhanced resulting in an improved color gamut. Panasonic claims a 25% improvement based on the 1976 CIE UCS color temperature coordinates.</p>
<p>Even though 1080/60i and 720/60p video capture is still limited to 17Mbps, for 1080/24p bandwidth has been opened up to 24Mbps. The rolling shutter jello effect is more pronounced compared to the GH1. RAW video can be outputted via HDMI.</p>
