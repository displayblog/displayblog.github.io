<p><a href="http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/132837-the-camera-that-can-see-through-frosted-glass-and-skin-and-around-corners">Sebastian Anthony, ExtremeTech</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ori Katz, Eran Small, and Yaron Silberberg of the Weizmann Institute have shown that they can accurately resolve an object that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s hiding behind nearly opaque obstacles, or around a corner (or in another room, as long as the door&acirc;&euro;&trade;s open. In both cases, the light is scattered by the obstacle (the frosted glass, the corner wall), creating what appears to be white noise &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; but their camera can take these speckles of noise and enhance them &acirc;&euro;&oelig;1000-fold&acirc;&euro;¬ù (the scientists&acirc;&euro;&trade; words) to recreate the image with surprising accuracy.</blockquote></p>
<p>Remember when Rick Deckard in <em>Blade Runner</em> was panning around corners in a digital image? Now we know what technology that was based on: SLM.</p>
