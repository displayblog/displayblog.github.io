<p>Choice words by <a href="http://blog.chasejarvis.com/blog/2010/09/nikon-d7000/">Chase Jarvis</a> regarding the newly announced Nikon D7000:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
The camera feels great.<br />
It's beefier than D90.<br />
Will do well for lots of markets.<br />
It feels great in your hand. Nice price.<br />
</div></p>
<p>Jarvis had a lot of fun:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reminder, if you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re looking for official specs or 3rd party &acirc;&euro;&oelig;testing&acirc;&euro;¬ù, I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m not your guy. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m an opinionated photographer and a filmmaker, and these are my gut responses. Nikon didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t review this post and they didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t tell me what to shoot. They didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t pay me for a technical analysis. They did pay for me to go out and make pictures and make a short film &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; and I had a blast doing it. They were cool and generous, and I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m thankful for the opportunity. And the camera rocked.</blockquote></p>
<p>Check out the videos and photograph samples. Nice stuff.</p>
