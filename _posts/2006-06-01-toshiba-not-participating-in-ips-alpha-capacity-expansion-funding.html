<p>Toshiba will put priority on developing its SED TV technology with Canon. SED stands for surface-conduction electron-emitter and was showcased during CES 2006. Initial reports were very positive.</p>
<p>There are billions being poured into LCD, from R&amp;D to manufacturing. LCDs will take a large portion of the TV market very soon and with aggressive prices. According to many, SED looks great, but at what price premiums to LCDs? I'm not sure Toshiba and Canon can do this alone. I would like to see one of the larger LCD guys like Samsung or LG.Philips LCD get interested in SED.</p>
