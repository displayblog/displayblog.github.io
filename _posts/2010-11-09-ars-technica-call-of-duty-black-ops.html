<blockquote><p>The 3D gives the game a lot of extra kick, and the subtle details really bring something to the experience. When you bring up the scope of your rifle you can tell the scope has its own depth, as does the area of the screen you're zoomed in on. The only downside is the dimness.</blockquote></p>
<p>Played with a PC that is "as top of the line as you can get right now" (that would be <a href="http://www.digitalstormonline.com/compblackops.asp">DigitalStorm's Black|Ops Assassin</a>) with all details cranked up to maximum, 3D glasses and a 3D monitor. High-end games are definitely pushing the envelope for computing and graphics power.</p>
