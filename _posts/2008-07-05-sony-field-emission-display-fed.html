<p><a href="http://gizmodo.com/5022302/sony-gets-serious-with-another-next+gen-display-tech-fed-like-crt-but-really-thin">Gizmodo</a>: Sony is aggressively researching field emission displays (FED) according to Nikkei. Why is Sony going after FED rather than OLED? There are some tough challenges to scale OLED to large sizes. Currently the largest OLED device that is commercially available is Sony's XEL-1 OLED TV that has a 11" display. That's very small. Sony has mentioned that a 27" OLED TV is in the works but I am doubtful that a 27" OLED TV can be successfully mass manufactured anytime soon.</p>
<p>FED, compared to OLED, is much easier to scale to larger sizes. In addition, FED can be very thin too. The basic technology used in FED is similar to CRT and feature deep blacks and near zero motion blur. Sony will be taking over a FED plant currently being operated by Pioneer and plans to introduce FED-based displays in late 2009. Sony will initially target the broadcasting and medical markets first, where there is less price sensitivity. Good move. After ramping volume production Sony will head toward the consumer markets with a 60" version. I'm excited to see another technology besides OLED. Although OLED is a great technology, I didn't like the possibility of waiting a very long time to actually own an OLED TV.</p>
