<p>There is not much information regarding this but <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=apple">Apple</a> tapped <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=asahi">Asahi</a> to develop a special type of glass that is used on the iPhone to enable the phone's <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=multitouch">multi-touch</a> feature. I am not sure what makes this Asahi glass so special, but I will guess that it enables the "touch" to be more accurately measured by the sensors, wherever those might be. I am sure transparency was improved so that touch sensitivity is accurate and light passes through so that colors can be vibrant and text sharp.</p>
