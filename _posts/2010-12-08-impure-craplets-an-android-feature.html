<blockquote><p><strong>6:49 pm</strong>: Walt: I notice more and more they are taking on the personality of the carrier, not Google, not the handset maker. There are lots of what I would call craplets. Verizon, for example, swapped out Google for Bing. Is there a danger it is being taken over?</p>

<p>Craplets are an Android feature, according to Andy Rubin. If the nature of open means that users must deal with the carrier-ization of Android smartphones &agrave; la craplets, then open also means your Android smartphone <em>will</em> slow down and becoming less responsive, precisely because of preinstalled carrier craplets.</p>

<blockquote><p>Note that some of the worst offenders in this category are apps that come pre-installed on your phone. Unfortunately, you need to be rooted to uninstall these [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>Craplets are poorly coded apps that hog inordinate amounts of CPU resources, in the background. There is no way to get rid of them unless you get access to the root Android OS system, not an easy task for many.</p>
<p>Maybe this is one of the reasons why we have the Nexus One and now the Nexus S: both have virgin Android OS installed. Google uses the term "Pure Google" to describe the Nexus S. The others, I guess, are then... impure?</p>
