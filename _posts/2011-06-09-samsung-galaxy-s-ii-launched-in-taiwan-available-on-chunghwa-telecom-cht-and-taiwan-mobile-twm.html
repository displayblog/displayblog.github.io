<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20110608PD217.html">DigiTimes</a>: Samsung Electronics launched the second generation Galaxy S smartphone, the Galaxy S II, in Taiwan and is available on Chunghwa Telecom (CHT) and Taiwan Mobile (TWM). According to some estimates, Samsung ranked second for the month of May in terms of unit shipments with a 21.3% share in Taiwan, behind number one Nokia (21.4%). Samsung's smartphone market share in Taiwan is higher at 31% of unit shipments and 64% of revenues.</p>
<p>According to Andy Tu, President of Samsung Taiwan's Mobile Communications unit, the Samsung Galaxy S II sold more than one million units in its first month after being launched in late April. Tu also noted that the Samsung Galaxy S II will be available worldwide in 120 countries in June.</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S II sports a 4.3-inch Super AMOLED Plus display that is different from the Super AMOLED display in the previous-generation Galaxy S. The new Super AMOLED Plus display technology uses a RGB stripe sub-pixel structure and packs 800x480 pixels. The 4.3-inch Super AMOLED Plus display is protected by Corning's Gorilla Glass, one of the toughest cover glass options, making the Samsung Galaxy S II resistant to scratches.</p>
