<blockquote><p>Only Apple could get away with charging a $400 premium for a feature that no one needs, few people will notice, doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t work with most apps, and was not on anyone&acirc;&euro;&trade;s wish list until the company announced it last month.</blockquote></p>
<p>I guess no one really <em>needs</em> a retina display, but if your eyes are not good enough to notice the difference between the regular and the retina display I would highly recommend making an appointment with an optometrist. And the bit about the retina display being a $400 premium? Here's <a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/07/14/rww-retina-clickbait">Marco Arment</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When each model is equipped with a 2.3 GHz i7, 8 GB of RAM, and a 256 GB SSD &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; the least-expensive specs available in common between both models &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; the non-Retina model costs $200 <em>more</em> than the Retina model.</blockquote></p>
