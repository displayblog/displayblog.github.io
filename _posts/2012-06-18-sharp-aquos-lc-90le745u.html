<p>The unremarkably named <a href="http://www.sharpusa.com/ForHome/HomeEntertainment/LCDTV/Models/LC90LE745U.aspx">LC-90LE745U</a> is the world's largest LCD TV with a LED backlight at 90 inches. Unfortunately the pixel format is 1920x1080, which translates to a measly 24 ppi resolution. US$10999.99.</p>
