<p><strong>L/A TFT LCD Panel Revenues</strong><br />
Q3&acirc;&euro;&sup2;08: Down 8% Q/Q, down 2% Y/Y, KRW 3861 billion</p>
<p>LPL's L/A TFT LCD panel shipments increased 12% Q/Q and 17% Y/Y to 3.67 million square meters of net display area. The results show that LCD area shipments depend heavily on those geared for <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a> applications accounting for 51% of revenues, up from 43% in Q2'08. This might be an over-exposure toward the LCD TV markets. Revenues from LCD panel shipments geared for <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-monitor">LCD monitor</a> and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=notebook-pc">notebook PC</a> applications accounted for 22% each.</p>

<p>ASP per square meter of net display area shipped was down 22% Q/Q and 27% Y/Y to US$992 and is the very first time that LPL's ASP/m2 fell below the $1000 mark. Cost of goods sold per square meter of display area in Q3'08 decreased 7% Q/Q due to pushing yields higher and developing lower-cost models. LPL is expecting shipments to continue to increase in Q4'08 by a "low to mid teens percentage" with COGS/m2 to decrease by a "high single digit percentage".</p>
<p>Glass substrate input capacity increased 8% Q/Q and 20% Y/Y to 5474K m2. LPL's P7 (its G7 LCD fab) comprised 40.9% of total capacity, up from 40.0% in Q2'08.</p>
