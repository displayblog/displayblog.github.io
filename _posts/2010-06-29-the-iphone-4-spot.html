<p>Cameron Hunt has posted up a video titled "<a href="http://vimeo.com/12864890">The Spot</a>":</p>
<blockquote><p>I can literally pause and resume a loading web page just by touching my finger to "The Spot".</blockquote><br />
The reception issue that Steve Jobs is denying the existence of (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/27/steve-jobs-on-iphone-4-there-is-no-reception-issue-stay-tuned/">Steve Jobs On iPhone 4: "There Is No Reception Issue. Stay Tuned."</a></em>) is just a single spot on the lower left corner of the iPhone 4. Just don't touch that little spot.</p>
