<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/4/5778556/lg-g3-review">Vlad Savov, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The most impressive thing about this screen is not its otherworldly 538ppi pixel density, but how efficient the designers have been with the space around it. 76.4 percent of the G3&acirc;&euro;&trade;s front is occupied by the display, allowing it to fit a larger panel into the same dimensions as the 5-inch HTC One and 5.2-inch Xperia Z2. LG&acirc;&euro;&trade;s phone is also significantly lighter than the others, making it feel much more streamlined.</p>
<p>Color accuracy, contrast, and viewing angles are all very good. The black background behind the G3&acirc;&euro;&trade;s on-screen Android keys is dark enough to seem to melt away into the phone&acirc;&euro;&trade;s black frame. Additionally, unlike Sony&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Xperia Z2, which struggles outdoors, the G3&acirc;&euro;&trade;s IPS display is bright enough to remain useful on a sunny day.</blockquote></p>
<p>The 5.5-inch LG G3 sports a pixel format of 2560x1440, the same as a 27-inch iMac.</p>
<p>(When I plug in 2560x1440 and 5.5 inches I get a resolution of 534 ppi. To get 538 ppi the diagonal length needs to be 5.46 inches.)</p>
