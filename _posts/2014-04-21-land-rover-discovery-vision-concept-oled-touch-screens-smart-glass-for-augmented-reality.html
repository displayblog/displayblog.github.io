<blockquote><p>The Discovery Vision Concept, which will be on display at the 2014 New York International Auto Show at the Javits Center, has futuristic features including OLED touch screens in the steering wheel, Smart Glass for augmented reality, and a "see through" hood for seeing obstacles while off-roading.</blockquote></p>
<p>I like displays, especially the latest and greatest displays. But sometimes I don't like displays, especially when they are plastered because they just happen to be the newest and coolest technology to incorporate into a less than new and cool thing. An OLED touch screen in the steering wheel? I don't like this at all.</p>
<p>When the day comes when our cars are fully automatic, meaning they will drive themselves, I won't mind if everything is made of unbreakable flexible touch displays. But for now I'm the driver and I need to focus on driving. And to focus I need physical knobs and buttons. I need to know I pushed the button or turned the knob, without having to look. No OLED touch displays, thank you. The Smart Glass for augmented reality though might be cool.</p>
