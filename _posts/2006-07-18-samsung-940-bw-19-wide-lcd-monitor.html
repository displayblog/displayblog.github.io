<p><a href="http://www.channeltimes.com/channeltimes/jsp/article.jsp?article_id=74203&amp;cat_id=862">ChannelTimes.com</a>: Samsung introduced its 940 BW 19" wide LCD monitor in India on June 28. The monitor has a 1440x900 resolution and has a 16:10 aspect ratio. Although ChannelTimes is indicating that two whole A4 size pages can be viewed side by side, that is not true. A4 size pages are even longer than letter sizes and not even 1680x1050 resolutions can handle two letter sized pages at 100% in Microsoft Word. You need at least a 1920x1200 resolution display to do that, barely.</p>
<p>Samsung is also planning to introduce other wide format LCD monitors with 20" and 21" in the third quarter of 2006. The funny thing about Samsung is that it does not know which size to choose since the company has 19", 20", and 21" sizes all in wide. I would not be surprised to see 22" soon. The 940 BW has high-bandwidth digital content protection (HDCP) probably working in conjunction with a DVI connection. The unit sports a 4ms response time.</p>
<p><em>Update 2008.04.16</em>: The 940BW is hard to come by these days. I did a quick check on <a href="http://computers.pricegrabber.com/flat-panel-lcd-monitors/m/24239977/zip_code=95129/qlty=r/st=zip/">PriceGrabber</a> and there are only two results: one is open-box and the other is refurbished. How times fly. But the prices are great. You can get the open-box version for just $159 (plus tax and shipping). Also, what I didn't mention before is that most 19" wide LCD panels are of the TN+Film variety, which have fairly fast response times (great for gaming) but is not as good at viewing angles compared to larger (and more expensive) PVA or IPS based units. Of course, at just $159, you shouldn't expect too much.</p>
