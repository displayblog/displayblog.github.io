<blockquote><p>We&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll never stop sharing our memories. Or getting lost in a good book. We&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll always cook dinner and cheer for our favorite team. We&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll still go to meetings, make home movies, and learn new things. But how we do all this will never be the same.</blockquote></p>
