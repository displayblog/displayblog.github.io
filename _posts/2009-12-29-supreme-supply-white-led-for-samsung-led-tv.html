<p>Supreme Electronics will supply its high-brightness white LEDs for Samsung's "LED TV" products, LCD TVs that have LED backlights. Shipments will start in January. LED will soon become the dominant light source for backlights in LCD TVs. Source: <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20091229PD210.html">DIGITIMES</a></p>
