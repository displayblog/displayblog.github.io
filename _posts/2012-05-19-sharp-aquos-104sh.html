<p>The Sharp AQUOS 104sh is an Android 4.0 smartphone sporting a 4.5-inch 1280x720 LCD good for a 326 ppi resolution. 1280x720 at the 4.x-mark seems to be where premium Android smartphones are congregating. To me Android smartphones are Android smartphones with little to no significant differences among the hundreds that are out there. But the Sharp AQUOS 104sh does seem to have an interesting and unique feature. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/4/2968160/sharp-aquos-phone-104sh-review">Sam Byford, The Verge</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>The display does have one interesting feature that I've never seen included in other manufacturers' devices before &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; Sharp's proprietary VeilView technology intentionally limits the viewing angles so that anyone looking from the side sees nothing but a geometric pattern, while the display remains readable to the phone's owner.</blockquote></p>
<p>Wide viewing angles when you want to share, and limited viewing angles when you want privacy. Pretty cool.</p>
