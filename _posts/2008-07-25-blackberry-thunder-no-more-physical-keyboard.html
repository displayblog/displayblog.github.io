CrackBerry addicts love typing away at the keyboard. The keyboard is one of the main distinctions between it and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=apple">Apple</a>'s <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=iphone">iPhone</a>, which eschews such crude old-school technology for the latest marvel in technology: touch. With a large TFT LCD display coupled with touch technology, there are obvious advantages. </p>
<p>One of the strongest advantage of a virtual keyboard is the ability to make it any language possible. With the iPhone 2.0 there were support for Chinese, Japanese and Korean text input. On a physical keyboard it would be impossible to support all three at once. Without a physical keyboard the BlackBerry and the iPhone devices are going to get a bit more difficult differentiate.</p>

<p>Look closely at the pictures of RIM's BlackBerry Thunder smartphone. And guess what? No physical keyboard. No more messing around with a physical keyboard. You get a full QWERTY keyboard in landscape mode and a less-than-ideal SureType keyboard in portrait mode. I personally like a real virtual QWERTY keyboard in both landscape and portrait modes. The Thunder also has <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=multitouch">multitouch</a> capability via a nice glass LCD. But in addition to touch, you get haptic feedback via tiny little motors that zing when you touch the LCD.</p>
<p>So, with the physical keyboard gone, what makes a BlackBerry a BlackBerry?</p>
