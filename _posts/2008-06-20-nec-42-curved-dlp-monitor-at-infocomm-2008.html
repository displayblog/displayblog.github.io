<p>NEC showcased its curved DLP monitor during InfoComm 2008 that was originally introduced to the world back in CES 2008. NEC's DLP monitor uses four DLP engines combined side to side for a total pixel format of 2880 x 900.</p>
<p>The experience in front of the curved DLP monitor was very good. The enclosed feeling is something you don't quite get with multiple <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-monitor">LCD monitor</a>s.</p>
<p>The super fast response time of less than 0.02ms will make for an exceptionally great gaming experience.</p>
<p>But there are two concerns.</p>
<p>One, the borders among the four DLP engines can be seen that takes away from that seamless curved display. </p>
<p>Two, the pixel format of 2880 x 900 is an interesting one. Basically it is 1440x900 side by side. 1440 x 900 is the standard pixel format for 19" wide LCD monitors. In an age of Full HD, 1080p, 1920x1080, the 900 vertical pixels aren't enough. I would like to see this product develop into featuring a pixel format of 3840x1080.</p>
