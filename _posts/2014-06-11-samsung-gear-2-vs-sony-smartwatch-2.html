<p>Neither smartwatch is appealing to me &mdash; the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/03/18/moto-360/">Moto 360</a> is, just from how it looks (mockups) but looks can be deceiving &mdash; but if you were wondering which had the better display between the two, look no further. <a href="http://www.displaymate.com/Smart_Watch_ShootOut_1.htm">Ray Soneira</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The OLED display on the Samsung Gear 2 performed very well across the board, almost identically to the most recent Galaxy S OLED Smartphones in almost every test measurement and viewing category. It looked and performed like a small version of a high quality OLED smartphone display &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; including sharpness, high pixels per inch, brightness, color depth, color gamut, viewing angle, in ambient light, and overall image and picture quality.</blockquote></p>
<p>Take a look at the comparison table at the link and it is obvious the OLED display used in the Samsung Gear 2 is solid. On the other hand, the LCD used in the Sony SmartWatch 2 isn't:</p>
<blockquote><p>In particular, the coarse and heavily pixelated low resolution and low pixels per inch screen made worse with poor anti-aliasing, the very low color depth, the poor color gamut in ambient light, and also the poor viewing angle performance (because watches are not easily positioned for zero degree viewing). Using a combination Transflective LCD comes with a significant performance penalty in both the backlight transmissive mode and the reflective mode that keeps the always on image visible in moderate ambient light and in some but not all high ambient light situations. The choices and compromises made by Sony for the SmartWatch 2 display simply do not work well.</blockquote></p>
<p>Similar to a smartphone or a tablet, I would think the importance of an excellent display on a smartwatch is obvious. I thought wrong.</p>
