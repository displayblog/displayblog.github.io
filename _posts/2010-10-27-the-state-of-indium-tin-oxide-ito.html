<p>A great read on <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5674505/ten-years-to-save-the-touchscreen">Gizmodo</a> regarding Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) the transparent and conductive material that makes LCDs work:</p>
<blockquote><p>The US Geological Survey estimates that known reserves of indium worldwide amount to some 16,000 tonnes, overwhelmingly in China. Dividing that by the rate at which we are currently using the stuff suggests those reserves will be exhausted by 2020.</blockquote></p>
