<p>HP CEO L&Atilde;&copy;o Apotheker in an interview with Walt Mossberg at <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20110701/hps-leo-apotheker-talks-webos-touchpad-and-more-the-full-d9-interview-video/?refcat=d9">D9</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The one lesson we learned from it is, and I'm driving our engineers crazy. We will not release a product that isn't perfect.</blockquote></p>
<p>The 'it' is RIM's launch of the PlayBook. The 'product' is the TouchPad. Almost all reviews agree the TouchPad is far from perfect.</p>
<p>When watching Apotheker speak those words, I sense machoism. He went too far with it.</p>
