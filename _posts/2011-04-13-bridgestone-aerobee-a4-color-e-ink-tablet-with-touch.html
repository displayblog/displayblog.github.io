<blockquote><p>The first terminal available and introduced today, an A4 e-Ink Tablet, comes with a 13.1&acirc;&euro;¬ù 4,096 colors touch panel with an 800&Atilde;&mdash;600 resolution offering a 1.3sec/page refresh rate and runs on Linux 2.6.24 with an ARM11 533MHz CPU and 128MB of RAM as well as 4GB of internal memory.</blockquote></p>
<p>What really intriques me is the combination of E Ink, thousands of colors, and touch. I can just imagine taking notes on this AeroBee (what a name) and reading books, magazines and newspapers on it. Forget the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/11/09/kno-us599-student-tablets/">Kno</a>, this is the future. The 800x600 pixel format is a bit weak and so is the time it takes to refresh a page, but this combination of technologies look very promising. I really do hope Bridgestone will consider making it available to regular folks like you and me. Just in case: A4 is 210x297 mm (8.27x11.7 in) and A3 is 297x420 mm (11.7x16.5). The standard paper size for printers the world over is A4, except for the US.</p>
