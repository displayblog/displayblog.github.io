  alt=\"RIDES Hyundai Genesis and Apple\" /></p>\r\n\r\nCars and displays:
  two of my favorite topics! For SEMA, the folks over at RIDES have revamped the Hyundai
  Genesis. RIDES has built a really cool mobile office in the back seats of the Genesis.
  The mobile office is built out of two Mac Minis and one MacBook Air. There are two
  8.4\" 800 x 480 TFT LCDs behind the two headrests connected to the Minis. Very cool.
  The only thing is that you'll need a personal driver (will probably cost you about
  as much as the Genesis) so you can sit back, relax, and drive-by-blog with a buddy. "

<p style="text-align: left;">The external design of the RIDES Digital Genesis is very nice: it exudes class. The wheels are 22" MHT three-piece wrapped around Pirelli rubber. The suspension is lowered and on the back are quad-tip exhausts and smoked taillights. Oh, if you pop open the trunk, you'll be greeted with Apple's 20" Cinema Display: great for surfing the web or watching a flick, I guess.</p></p>
