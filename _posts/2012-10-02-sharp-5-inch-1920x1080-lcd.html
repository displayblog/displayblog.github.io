<p><a href="http://sharp-world.com/corporate/news/121001.html">Sharp</a>: Japan's largest LCD supplier announced manufacturing commencement of its 5-inch 1920x1080 LCD at its Mie Plant No. 3. The resolution of 443 ppi is, I think, the highest for any display that is currently in production.</p>
<p>Sharp is using continuous grain silicon (CGS) as the material for the thin film transistors (TFT) instead of its oxide semiconductor-based <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2012/09/01/sharp-igzo/">IGZO</a>. IGZO might be the new thing by Sharp but when it comes to electron mobility it is in the middle of amorphous silicon (a-Si) and low temperature poly-silicon (LTPS). LTPS is fast, but CGS is even faster: 3x the electron mobility of LTPS. With a resolution of 443 ppi electrons need to move around faster for a flicker-free visual experience and CGS gets the job done better than LTPS, IGZO, or a-Si.</p>
