<blockquote><p>Well, would you have a gander at that? <em>That</em>, friends, is Apple's long-awaited, hardly-forgotten white iPhone 4, and so far as we can tell, this is actually the real deal. We've seen retailers making space for the elusive handset over the past few months, and earlier today, we heard that Vodafone UK's inventory systems were showing the white iPhone 4 as shipping in.</blockquote></p>

Two, unlike <a href="http://thisismynext.com/2011/04/22/iphone-5-design/">what Joshua Topolsky might think</a>, the next iPhone will probably look the same as it looks now and be called <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/12/03/iphone-4s/">iPhone 4S</a>.</p>
