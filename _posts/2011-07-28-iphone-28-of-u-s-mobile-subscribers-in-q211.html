<p><a href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/?p=28516">Nielsen</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to June data from Nielsen, Google&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Android operating system (OS) now claims the largest share of the U.S. consumer smartphone market with 39 percent. Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s iOS is in second place with 28 percent, while RIM Blackberry is down to 20 percent.</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple and RIM combined for almost half the market share of U.S. mobile subscribers. That's quite impressive considering a bunch of companies including HTC, Motorola, Samsung, HP, Nokia, etc. only managed to capture the other half.</p>
