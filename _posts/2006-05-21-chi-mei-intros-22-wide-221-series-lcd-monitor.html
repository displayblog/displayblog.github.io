<p>Although we in the US don't get a Chi Mei-branded LCD monitor (good thing?), the folks in Taiwan will be surprised to see another size available to them when it comes to LCD monitors: 22" wide. Remember a long time ago when Apple had a 22" wide? Well, it seems the size is coming back. CMO's 22" wide has a pixel format of 1680*1050, which isn't too bad but is quite a bit lower than the 23" wide panels out there with a lot more pixels: 1920 x 1200. I'm sure the 22" wide is a strategy born out of the need to bring down the cost of 20"+ LCD monitors to not only load up their large fabs but also to see that market segment grow.</p>
<p>-22" wide, 16:10 aspect ratio<br />
-1680 x 1050 pixel format-330 cd/m2-800:1 CR<br />
-5ms response time (RT)<br />
-170/160 (H/V viewing angles, using TN+Film to enhance wide viewing angles)</p>
<p>Nexgen Mediatech, a Chi Mei Group member, will be selling the 221 series at NT$16,900 (~US$530) and has a fairly aggressive goal of selling 1 million Chi Mei-branded monitors in 2006 including other sizes. The Chi Mei brand will be available in Australia later this year while Europe will have the Mirai branded version.</p>
<p>Rumor has it Viewsonic is also in on the 22" bandwagon and will be releasing their wide monitor either this month or next.&Acirc;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.digitimes.com/displays/a20060519PR205.html"></a></p>
