<p><a href="http://www.akihabaranews.com/en/news-16781-CEATEC+2008+Live+%3A+Nice+advanced+concept+from+Docomo+and+Fujitsu.html">Akihabara News</a>: Fujitsu and Docomo showcased a very interesting concept smartphone during CEATEC 2008. The smartphone has two parts. Both parts have displays. One is used as the main display while the other is used as the keypad or keyboard. The two parts are physically stuck to each other via magnets and communication duties between the two parts are accomplished via Bluetooth. The keypad shows up in portrait mode and in landscape mode a QWERTY keyboard shows up. Naturally, both of these units have touch-enabled displays.</p>

<p>One question I have is regarding the strength of the magnets. When these units are connected in portrait mode, it would seem to be easy to shift them and bring them apart. I am sure if this is the case that the strength of the magnets can be easily increased. Also, I wonder if Bluetooth currently has enough bandwidth to support streaming video. Although I am not sure of the pixel format on the display, I would guess it to be around 3" in size and about 320x480 in pixels.</p>

<p>This is a very interesting concept and might be the precursor to "foldable" displays in the future. Imagine a notebook PC that is composed of two separate displays just like this concept from Fujitsu. Pretty cool.</p>
