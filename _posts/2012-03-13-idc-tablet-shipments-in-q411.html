<p><a href="http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS23371312">IDC</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite an impressive debut by Amazon, which shipped 4.7 million Kindle Fires into the market, Apple continued to see strong growth in the quarter, shipping 15.4 million units in 4Q11, up from 11.1 million units in 3Q11. That represents a 54.7% worldwide market share (down from 61.5% in 3Q11). Amazon's shipment total put the company in second place with 16.8% of the worldwide market. Third-place Samsung grew its share from 5.5% in 3Q11 to 5.8% in 4Q11.</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple shipped 15.4 million iPads in Q4'11. <em>Shipped?</em> You mean sold, to customers. Nobody knows how many of anything Apple ships. Same thing with the Amazon Kindle Fire. Sold, not shipped. And then IDC outdoes itself by comparing those numbers to Samsung's shipment&mdash;shipment into the channel, not customers&mdash;numbers. The entire analysis is flawed, <a href="/2011/12/17/idc-confuses-tablet-shipments-into-the-channel-sales-to-customers/">again</a>.</p>
