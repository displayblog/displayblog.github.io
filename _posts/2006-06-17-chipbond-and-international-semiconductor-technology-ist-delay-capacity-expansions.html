<p>Chipbond and IST are driver IC packaging companies. Driver ICs go into LCD panels and control the thin-film-transistors (TFT) that control the currents that control the liquid crystals (LCs) that control light that control what you see in front of your screen. Boy, that was a mouth-full. These two companies are expecting slow Q2 sales and capacity expansions slated for 1H&#39;06 have now been delayed to 2H&#39;06.</p>
<p>Chipbond will maintain tape carrier package (TCP) and chip on film (COF) packaging capacity at 30 million per month by 2006E. Its gold-bumping capacity will remain the same at 180K per month. IST&#39;s chip on glass (COG) capacity is expected to reach 31 million per month by 2006E and its TCP+COF packaging capacity will hit 38 million per month.</p>
