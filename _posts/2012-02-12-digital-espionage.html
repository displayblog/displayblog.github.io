<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/02/12/digital-espionage">John Gruber</a>. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/11/technology/electronic-security-a-worry-in-an-age-of-digital-espionage.html?_r=2&pagewanted=all">Nicole Perlroth, The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When Kenneth G. Lieberthal, a China expert at the Brookings Institution, travels to that country, he follows a routine that seems straight from a spy film.</p>
<p>He leaves his cellphone and laptop at home and instead brings &acirc;&euro;&oelig;loaner&acirc;&euro; devices, which he erases before he leaves the United States and wipes clean the minute he returns. In China, he disables Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, never lets his phone out of his sight and, in meetings, not only turns off his phone but also removes the battery, for fear his microphone could be turned on remotely. He connects to the Internet only through an encrypted, password-protected channel, and copies and pastes his password from a USB thumb drive. He never types in a password directly, because, he said, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;the Chinese are very good at installing key-logging software on your laptop.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>This, right after being told <a href="/2012/02/12/email-is-not-secure/">email is not secure</a>, isn't sitting well.</p>
