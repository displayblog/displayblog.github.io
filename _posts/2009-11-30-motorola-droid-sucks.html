  does the Droid\". But Dave thinks all of today's phones suck:\r\n<blockquote>Today's
  phones are marvels of technology. I love them. But they all suck. Let me repeat
  that: THEY ALL SUCK.</blockquote>\r\nDave really does not like that the battery
  cover won't stay on the Droid. But he doesn't like the iPhone either:\r\n<blockquote>It's
  a lovely piece of art, run by a platform vendor with a shitty idea of users and
  developers and serviced by a phone company that can't run a cellular phone network.</blockquote>\r\nBut
  Dave Winer isn't the only one, Stewart Alsop, former editor and columnist at InfoWorld
  and now a venture capitalist, also doesn't like the Droid. His main point from his
  article \"Droid Doesn't: It's Not Ready For Prime Time\":\r\n<blockquote>The Motorola
  Droid is truly terrible... most of the blame for the cruddiness of the phone really
  should be laid at Google's feet, not Motorola's.</blockquote>\r\nSo what are
  some things Stewart doesn't like about the Droid? There are many:"

<p>Horrible keyboard. Non-functioning camera button. Poorly placed and difficult to use on/off button. Android isn't ready for prime time as it does not respond at times and sometimes responds with cryptic messages.</p>
<blockquote><p>The software is so bad that, for instance, when you open the phone app and click on search, there are multiple opportunities for the software to not respond or to respond incorrectly, which means that the phone is not usable unless you are staring [sic] intently at it and very, very patient about waiting for something to happen.</blockquote><br />
I've been thinking about the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=iphone&amp;sa=Search#1363">iPhone</a> and other app phones like the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=droid&amp;sa=Search#1333">Droid</a> and the BlackBerry for quite some time. These app phones can do so many things but it seems they can't do anything really well. For instance, the iPhone's Visual Voicemail is wonderful, when there is a sufficiently strong data signal from AT&amp;T. The camera is quite good but not better than a $150 point-and-shoot from Canon. The Safari browser is quite innovative but do you really want to surf on the 3.5-inch LCD? Music is okay but I'd rather listen to the birds or even the engine noise of a sports car that races by. And it is so fragile! One of the Droid's advantages over the iPhone should be the physical QWERTY keyboard but most say it sucks. So what a waste: more weight, mechanical engineering, etc. At least the Droid is on Verizon so you should be able to use it as a reliable phone, but maybe not thanks to the not-ready-for-prime-time Android 2.0. The closest thing to the iPhone and the Droid from RIM is the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=storm2&amp;sa=Search#1051">Storm2</a> but I hear the haptic virtual keyboard is marginally better than the original and there still isn't multitouch on it. Maybe we are expecting too much from a single device.</p>
<p>What I have been wanting to do is to get a really good phone: one that doesn't do much else but allow me to reliably take and make voice calls. Unfortunately, in the US, that means getting off of AT&amp;T and getting on Verizon. Can someone make a rugged, light, sexy phone that has really good buttons and makes terrific phone calls? Here's what I <em>don't</em> want in the phone: extra buttons for crappy proprietary services, an even crappier camera, Internet connectivity, QWERTY keyboard, sliding mechanism, clamshell design, big and fragile display, customizable ringtones, and anything that gets in the way of making a solid high-quality voice call. Can you guys make something like that? If Apple would rip all the data connectivity chips (3G, WiFi, Bluetooth, etc.) out of the iPhone, leave just the Phone, Contacts and Settings button, and make it 2/3 the size and half the thickness that would be really great. Oh, and sell it on Verizon for $49.</p>
