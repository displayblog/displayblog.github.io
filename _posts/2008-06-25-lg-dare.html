<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lg">LG</a>'s Dare seems to be an impressive <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=smartphone">smartphone</a> with most of its front face being occupied by a touch and haptic enabled 3" TFT LCD. The user interface seems to have been the result of some serious thinking apart from how <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=apple">Apple</a> did it. Of course, in my opinion, Apple has the best smarphone UI as implemented on the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=iphone">iPhone</a>.</p>
<p>Technically, the haptic capability isn't embedded in the screen. There are very small micro-motors stationed around the phone's interior and when you touch the screen these micro-motors are activated making it seem like the screen is responding to your touch. Haptic capability does help in giving feedback to the user, but there needs to be a bit more intelligence embedded that deciphers between simple touches and virtual buttons pushed.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=3"">3"</a> LCD sports a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=240-x-400">240 x 400</a> pixel format, which I think is not enough. LG needs to realize that if you're competing against the best, at least meet the specifications of the best and that would mean a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=3.5"">3.5"</a> LCD with a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=320-x-480">320 x 480</a> pixel format. With the thick bezels all around, I don't think incorporating a bigger LCD would pose too much of a problem for LG's next version, hopefully a Dare 2. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/06/25/lg-dare-hands-on/">Engadget has a hands-on with the Dare</a>.</p>
