<p>Hmmm... the HP Slate looks exceptionally terrible. There's a Ctrl-Alt-Delete key? At first, I thought it unbelievable, but now I'm thinking, "Of course! It <em>is</em> Windows 7!"</p>
<p>How unfortunate.</p>
<p>Here are some other observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>You still have a mouse pointer; it disappears though.</li>
<li>Touch feedback blue dot animation: I thought this was only used when you were developing an ad to help folks visually see what your fingers are doing without actually showing the fingers. I guess not.</li>
<li>Browser performance is slow, excruciatingly slow. I was grasping for air just looking at it.</li>
<li>Keyboard button: You need it since it isn't automatic. Just terrible.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>I guess Microsoft was spending too much time developing the Windows Phone 7 mobile OS to give much thought to the tablet-version of Windows 7. Of course, this video is of a <em>prototype</em> HP Slate so there is the possibility of things getting better, but I wouldn't hold my breath. This is the case of the OS choking the hardware design and ruining the entire experience. If I had the choice between a HP Slate and a Samsung Galaxy Tab there is no doubt in my mind which is better. Here's hoping HP will dump this garbage and focus on a webOS tablet. <em>via</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/09/23/hp-slate">Daring Fireball</a></p>
