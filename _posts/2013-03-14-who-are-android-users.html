<p>Nicholas Carlson, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/android-owners-arent-real-smartphone-owners-2013-3">Business Insider</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Android owners, for the most part, are just looking for a new cellphone, and will take whatever is handed to them at the store that doesn't cost any extra money. These days, that's usually an Android phone.</blockquote></p>
