<blockquote><p>We're not expecting any surprises in terms of image quality; Canon says the EOS M's stills and video output will be identical to the EOS 650D, which means it should be a close match to anything else in its class.</blockquote></p>
<p><em>Update 2012.11.09:</em> Roger Cicala, <a href="http://www.petapixel.com/2012/10/30/first-impressions-of-the-canon-eos-m-mirrorless-camera/">PetaPixel</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m all about image quality above all other things. This camera gives me great, great image quality in an amazingly small package.</p>
<p>Will it replace an OM-D or SLR for my everyday shooting? Absolutly not: its AF is too slow and there aren&acirc;&euro;&trade;t many native lenses yet.</blockquote></p>
<p>The EOS M is priced US$799.99. Even if Canon updated the firmware to improve AF speeds and reduced the price to $699.99, I wouldn't be able to get over the ugly design.</p>
