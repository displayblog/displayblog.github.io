<p><a href="http://shop.nationalgeographic.com/ngs/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=1076014">National Geographic</a>: All of National Geographic, from 1888 to 2008, is on a 160GB HDD. With 100GB to spare. National Geographic seems to have done a tremendous job of compressing 120 years worth of data, pictures, videos, etc. into just 60GB. I wish I could do that. For the convenience of having everything on a HDD instead of 6 separate DVDs you pay US$200, a $140 premium over the DVDs. A 64GB SSD would have been more useful.</p>
