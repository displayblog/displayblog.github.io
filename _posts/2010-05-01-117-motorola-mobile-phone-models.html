<p>There are 117 mobile phone models made by Motorola! Compare that to Apple's one (or three if you want to be picky: 8GB 3G, 16GB 3GS, 32GB 3GS). Does Motorola think there is a market for all 117 models? I think the problem may be that Motorola isn't thinking at all. I say that not because I dislike Motorola (I still use a RAZR V3 and would like a keyboard-less Droid). Maybe we can see better models when Motorola decides 117 is too much and bring the number down to around, say 10.
