<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20110504PD215.html">DigiTimes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite that most tablet PCs do not adopt cooling fans because of their low power consumption, Taiwan-based cooling fan makers have pointed out that vendors are starting to adopt cooling fans for their models to boost overall performance. The makers estimated that models with cooling fans will account for 5-10% of total tablet PC shipments in 2012.</blockquote></p>
<p>And these cooling fan equipped tablet PCs will be the ones that folks won't want. Unless what you want is a full-blown super-powerful PC in tablet form with every conceivable port, runs Windows, and costs a bunch of money.</p>
