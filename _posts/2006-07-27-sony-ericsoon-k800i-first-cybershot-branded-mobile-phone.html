<p><a href="http://reviews.cnet.co.uk/mobiles/0,39030106,49282125,00.htm">c|net UK</a>: Cybershot is the brand that Sony uses for digital cameras in some markets such as the US. It's K800i is a mobile phone and is the first to have the brand Cybershot on it. The K800i has a fairly high-resolution 3.2 megapixel auto-focus camera with a Xenon-based flash and lens cover. It lets you have conversations via video, has a FM radio and MP3 player and simple PIM functions (calendar, notes, task list, world time, etc.) and is a 3G phone. A four-point joystick is used for navigation and controling music playback.</p>
<p>The main screen is 2.1" in size and has a resolution of 240 x 320 pixels, or QVGA. The LCD displays 262,144 colors. With side buttons, the K800i can be used like a regular digital camera, on its side. Instead of using a Memory Stick Pro Duo, Sony Ericsson decided on the smaller format Memory Stick Micro, which is only 15 x 12.5 x 1.2mm -- very small.</p>
<p>The phone works on GSM 900, 1800, 1900 and UMTS networks with talk times of up to 7 hours on GSM networks and 2 1/2 hours on UMTS. Standby times are up to 350 hours for GSM and UMTS. For data connectivity, it is GPRS (2.5G) capable and connects to WCDMA (3G) networks. It has a built-in memory of 64MB, but will not be enough to store video captures of up to 176 x 144 or QCIF resolutions.</p>
