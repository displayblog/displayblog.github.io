<blockquote><p>The second issue, which is being conflated with the first, is characterized by light bleeding through from the outer edges of the LCD panel. </blockquote></p>
<p>The first problem reported by some is a yellow patch on the LCD. The second is this light bleeding problem, which can be a big one or a small one.</p>
<p>It's a big problem if the LED-based backlight unit (BLU) is defective. I'm fairly sure the BLU is located on the bottom of the LCD in portrait orientation and that's where the problem seems to be.</p>
<p>Let's hope it's a small problem though: someone at Foxconn forgot to put some black tape around the bottom bezel of the LCD module. Just a wild guess on my part based on what I've seen on my 17-inch MacBook Pro when I took the cover glass off: there were a lot of black tape around the bezel of the LCD to prevent light leakage.</p>
<p>Regardless, if you have an iPad 2 that has light bleeding take it back and get a new one. Hopefully you bought an iPad 2 at the Apple Store because service is heads and shoulders above anywhere else. Even if you have to wait a light bleeding LCD will be extremely annoying and you don't want to be living with one for a long time.</p>
