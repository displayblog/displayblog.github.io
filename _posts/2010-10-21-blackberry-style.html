<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/21/blackberry-style-first-hands-on/">Engadget</a> took the BlackBerry Style for a spin:</p>
<blockquote><p>... essentially a clamshell riff on the Curve line; to that end, we'd argue that it feels a little cheaper than your average Bold, but it still seems to be a marked improvement from the Pearl flips of days gone by..</blockquote></p>
<p>For BlackBerry fans who want a clamshell phone. Looks quaint.</p>
<p>I would think a display would make more sense on the bottom, instead of the QWERTY keyboard. Wouldn't it cost a lot and be complicated to manage all the different languages for different countries?  Then RIM would have just one model that allows for pretty much all languages in the world. That would solve the lack of easy access to international keyboards and reduce costs.</p>
