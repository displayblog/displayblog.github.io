<blockquote><p>Android handsets used in China accounted for 64.1% of global virus/malware attacks in the first quarter of 2011, according to China-based mobile security solutions provider NetQin Mobile.</p>
<p>There were 2.53 million Android handsets infected by viruses or malware around the world during the first quarter, and most were in China due to the popularity of white-box Android handsets in the country, NetQin indicated.</blockquote></p>
<p>Hackers now have two targets: old IE versions the world over, and Android white-box smartphones in China.</p>
