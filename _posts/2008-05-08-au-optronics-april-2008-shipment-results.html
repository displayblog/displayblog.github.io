<p>On May 7, 2008, AU Optronics (AUO) announced April 2008 shipment results and they are not pretty. Preliminary consolidate revenues were down 9.9% M/M and up 34.4% Y/Y to NT$42.4 billion while unconsolidated revenues were down 10% M/M and up 33.4% Y/Y to NT$42.1 billion.</p>
<p>Large-area LCD panel shipments in April were down 7.7% M/M to 7.38 million units. Small/medium LCD shipments, on the other hand, grew 6.3% M/M to 14.5 million units.</p>
<p>LCD monitor sales have been generally sluggish. LCD TV sales are transitioning toward smaller and more affordable units. Although Q2 of each calendar year has traditionally been a weak quarter due to seasonal purchasing patterns, I think this year will see even worse performance do to one of the largest markets for these gears, the US, having a tough time.</p>
