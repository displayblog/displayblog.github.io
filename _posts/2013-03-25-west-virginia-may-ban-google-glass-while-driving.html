<p>Cyrus Farivar, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/before-its-release-west-virginia-may-regulate-google-glass-while-driving/">Ars Technica</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57575954-38/dont-glass-and-drive-lawmakers-seek-to-ban-google-glass-on-the-road/">Late last week</a>, a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates <a href="http://www.legis.state.wv.us/Bill_Status/bills_text.cfm?billdoc=hb3057+intr.htm&yr=2013&sesstype=RS&i=3057">introduced</a> new state legislation that would effectively ban Google Glass usage while driving. As far as we know, if West Virginia's bill were to pass, it would be the first bill in the country to address Google Glass and similar devices.</blockquote></p>
<p>I think Google Glass could be a better GPS navigation device than what we have now. With Google Glass our eyes move much less to check where we are and where we are headed compared to smartphones, traditional navigation devices, or even built-in navigation displays in our cars. Instead of attempting to ban Google Glass, the goal should be to limit distractions when driving. In the case of Google Glass a "Drive Mode" could be initiated to limit certain features while allowing the driver to benefit from an enhanced navigation experience.</p>
