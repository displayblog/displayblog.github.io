<p><a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/04/09/apple-likely-to-launch-low-cost-imac-soon-retina-macbook-air-still-on-track-for-2014-debut">Neil Hughes, AppleInsider</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Though the new MacBook Air will apparently be minimalist, it will continue to offer a physical keyboard in addition to a modified trackpad, Kuo said. And the 12-inch model, sandwiched in between the 11.6- and 13.3-inch sizes Apple current offers in its MacBook Air lineup, is expected to feature a high-resolution Retina display &acirc;&euro;&oelig;thanks to advanced panel technology.&acirc;&euro;¬ù</blockquote></p>
<p>That's KGI Securities' Ming-Chi Kuo.</p>
<p>From time to time I go back to the story of Steve Jobs when he returned to Apple and drew a 2x2 table on the board: Consumer and Professional on one axis and Portable and Desktop on the other. Now Apple's product lineup has become quite a bit more complex than that.</p>
<p>For notebooks Apple has the MacBook Air in two sizes and the MacBook Pro in two sizes. If Kuo is right, a 12-inch retina MacBook Air could concentrate the consumer line of Apple notebooks to just one model. Maybe the MacBook Pro line can be focused into just a single 14-inch model. That would streamline Apple's supply chain and help the company concentrate. A single consumer notebook model and a single professional notebook model can bring down cost, increase quality, and be more price competitive.</p>
