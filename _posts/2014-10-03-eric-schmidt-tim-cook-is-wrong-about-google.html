<p>Logan Whiteside, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/10/02/technology/security/google-apple-privacy/">CNN</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;But at Apple, we believe a great customer experience shouldn't come at the expense of your privacy,&acirc;&euro; Cook said on Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s newly updated privacy website.</p>
<p>Schmidt fired back against Cook, saying Google works extremely hard to protect its users&acirc;&euro;&trade; information from other companies, the government, and hackers. He also noted customers have the option to change their settings and share less.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Someone didn't brief him correctly on Google's policies,&acirc;&euro; Schmidt said. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s unfortunate for him.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote><br />
Google, of course, needs to work incredibly hard to protect its users&acirc;&euro;&trade; information because the company has an enormous amount of&Acirc;&nbsp;sensitive&Acirc;&nbsp;user information to protect. And Google customers cannot change settings so we share nothing with Google, just less. Apple, on the other hand, is not in the business of collecting user information. Cook was explaining that Apple&Acirc;&nbsp;and Google have different business models. Schmidt responded by explaining Google works hard to protect customer information the company collects.</p>
<p>Schmidt&acirc;&euro;&trade;s response reminds me of an old Chinese saying:&Acirc;&nbsp;&aelig;&plusmn;&aring;&bull;&egrave;&yen;&iquest;&ccedil;&shy;&rdquo;, which literally&Acirc;&nbsp;means ask east, answer west. Figuratively it&Acirc;&nbsp;means, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;<em>What?!?</em>&acirc;&euro;</p>
