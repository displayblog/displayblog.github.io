AU Optronics (AUO) announced on March 11 the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s first 24" LCD panel with an aspect ratio of 16:9 and a pixel format of 1920 x 1080 geared for desktop monitor applications. Traditionally, 24" LCD monitors have had a pixel format of 1920 x 1200 with an aspect ratio of 16:10. AUO calls the new application for its 16:9 1080p LCDs, "MoniTV". In my opinion, I don't think there needs to be a new application segment that needs to be defined.<br />
</p>
<p>
The 24" 1080p LCD is also very thin at just 14mm compared to a typical thickness of 35mm. AUO also claims that it is significantly lighter compared to the older 24" designs. This would help them reduce cost on transportation. In addition, AUO claims mura issues have been reduced, light uniformity improved and power consumption reduced by 50%. Power consumption is decreased by reducing the number of CCFLs used in the backlight unit (BLU). Even with the 50% power consumption reduction, the on-screen performance is quite respectable at 300 cd/m2 of brightness, a contrast ratio of 1000:1.<br />
</p>
<p>
Everyone is talking about carbon emission and the reduction of it. AUO talks about it too. With a typical 50K hour lifetime, a 50% reduction in power consumption saves 2500 watts of power that equals a reduction of 1.6 tons of carbon emissions. I don't know exactly how that number was calculated, but it seems the new 24" LCD panel is doing the world a favor.<br />
</p>
<p>
By Q2'08, AUO will introduce 18.5", 21.5", 24" and 32" 1080p LCD monitor panels. The 27" 1080p LCD will be available in Q4'08. The 15" 16:9 model is already commercialized, but I am not sure it is 1080p.&acirc;&euro;&uml;</p>
