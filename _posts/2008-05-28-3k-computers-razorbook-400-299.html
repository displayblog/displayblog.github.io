<p><a href="http://www.3kcomputers.com/shop/index.php?act=viewProd&productId=57">3K Computers</a> announced on May 28, 2008 that its 3K RazorBook 400 Mini Notebook Ultra Mobile PC (or simply ultra-portable) will be priced at just $299. That is an excellent price! With the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=olpc">OLPC</a> priced at around $200 with a non-standard operating system in addition to it being really slow, I think aggressively priced standard notebook PCs can be just as effective in getting them into the hands of those who can't afford pricier models.</p>
<p>The 7-inch TFT LCD sports a pixel format of 800x480 that isn't good for particularly anything but will be decent enough for checking email, RSS feeds, IM, and the occasional web surfing. I don't recommend surfing the web with a 800 x 480 screen unless the OS allows for double-tapping to zoom in and out like what the iPhone does. (I'm an iPhone fan.)</p>
