<p><a href="http://www.mobilecomputermag.co.uk/200909101446/hands-on-with-the-asus-ul50.html">Mobile Computer</a>:  Jonathan Tsang, Vice Chairman of ASUS, stated back in June:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our goal is to provide products that are better than Apple's.</blockquote></p>
<p>What should I make of that. It certainly is an ambitious statement. Can ASUS reach its goal? I think so. You see, ASUS is focusing on products; Apple is focusing on the entire experience. Can any company beat Apple at providing a better total experience?</p>
<p><em>Plastic?</em></p>
<p>ASUS spends very little on marketing and instead the majority of its budget goes into engineering products. And that's a good thing because the company will need every resource available to get products that are better than Apple's.</p>
<p>The UL50 from ASUS is one of those attempts and Mobile Computer got to spend time with a pre-production unit and seems to have liked the brushed aluminum lid, a solid LCD and the full-sized keyboard with the numeric keypad.</p>
<p>I personally like my keyboard to be right in the middle and offset keyboard would be a negative in my book. The rest of the body is plastic--this right here fails to be better than the last-generation MacBook Pro that was all aluminum. There's more.</p>
<p><em>Lacking Pixels</em></p>
<p>The UL50 sports an Intel CULV CPU and a glossy 15.6-inch LED backlit LCD with a low-end 1366x768 resolution. The 15.4-inch MacBook Pro boasts a 1440x900 resolution, so the UL50 loses out in the resolution category. The UL50 has a trackpad that is integrated with the chassis but isn't slippery enough if your fingers aren't completely dry. Other features include a chassis that is just 1-inch thick and a weight that is quite light at&Acirc;&nbsp;2.1kg or 4.62lb. The UL50 beats the 15.4-inch MacBook Pro in the weight category by 0.39kg or 0.858lb. But the MacBook Pro is slightly thinner at just 0.95-inch.</p>
<p><em>Weak Computing Power</em></p>
<p>ASUS will power the UL50 with Intel's SU7300, which is a Core 2 Duo running at 1.3GHz. The MacBook Pro kicks the UL50 down hard with the base model running a 2.53GHz Core 2 Duo. Of course the Mac only runs for 7 hours max; the UL goes on for 3 more hours, most likely with a bigger battery than the 2200mAh that was supplied to Mobile Computer.</p>
<p><em>Better?</em></p>
<p>So here are the <em>tentative</em> results (since the UL50 is a pre-production model):</p>
<ul>
<li>Chassis: Apple wins with an all aluminum and unibody chassis compared to just an aluminum lid with plastics all over on the UL50. Apple 1: ASUS 0</li>
<li>Resolution: Apple wins with a 1440 x 900 resolution despite being slightly smaller than the UL50, which only has a paltry 1366 x 768. I also prefer a 16:10 LCD that gives me more rows. I do watch HD content but I do a lot more work on my notebooks. Apple 2: ASUS 0</li>
<li>Weight: ASUS beats out Apple with a lighter package. Apple 2: ASUS 1</li>
<li>Computing Power: Apple whips ASUS with a processor that should be about twice as fast. Apple 3: ASUS 1</li>
<li>Battery: ASUS lasts 3 hours longer, but you might have to get a bigger battery adding to the weight and thickness. No definitive winner here.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>A tentative win for Apple with 3 wins against just 1 for ASUS. There's also the question of price. Undoubtedly the ASUS UL50 will be much cheaper than the 15.4-inch MacBook Pro. Even with a recent price cut for the MacBook Pro the starting price is still a significant US$1699.</p>
