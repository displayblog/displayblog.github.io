<p>Sharp improved the contrast ratio from 500:1 to 1500:1. That's good, very good. Unlike typical displays where the user might be at slightly different angles looking at the screen, a driver of a car is usually squarely in front of the display. So, 'specsmanship' in this case can be regarded as fairly accurate for how the LCD will be used.</p>

<p>The screen is 8" wide with a pixel format of 800 x 480. Because the pictures are pretty small, I can't see if the resolution is good enough for tachometers and speedometers, and other gauges. A digitalized dash will definitely usher in many creative designs that we simply cannot implement in an analog dash. But, I like analog--gauges, dials, all of it. The computerization of the automobile is something I don't like very much. Maybe it is because I don't like the idea of paying some auto-computer geek to 'test' my car to see what problems I have. Maybe it is because I like driving a car, not a computer. I have Need 4 Speed for that, which I enjoy playing very much.</p>
