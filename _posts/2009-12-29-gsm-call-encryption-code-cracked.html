<p>GSM connections are protected by a 64-bit encryption algorithm that was developed in 1988. Karsten Nohl, a German computer engineer, cracked the algorithm via brute force. The GSM Association's solution? Operators should modify the existing code to re-secure their networks. And that would mean the re-secured GSM networks would be vulnerable to another brute-force crack. Time to upgrade to the 128-bit key, which the GSM Association has had available since 2007.
