<p>The HP 2509m is a 25-inch 1080p LCD monitor. I think this is the very first 25-inch LCD monitor that I have ever seen. The 25-inch size should make for slightly larger default font sizes on Windows and OS X so that should be good for those that have been thinking the fonts could use a slight boost in the size. The 2509m makes use of HP's BrightView display that has anti-glare properties. I personally don't like glare displays and it is good to know that HP is realizing that there are many customers that would rather have anti-glare. Here are some specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display: 25-inch TFT LCD</li>
<li>Resolution: 1920x1080</li>
<li>Contrast Ratio: 1000:1 (static)</li>
<li>Brightness: 300 cd/m2</li>
<li>Response Time: 5ms (Ton/Toff), 3ms (GTG)</li>
<li>Connectivity: VGA, DVI-D with HDCP, HDMI with HDCP</li>
<li>Dimensions: 24.32 x 17.22 x 7.91-inch</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>In addition to these specs, modern HP monitors that make use of this particular stand can be easily adjusted to suite your needs: height, tilt and swivel. <a href="http://www.shopping.hp.com/product/display/display/1/storefronts/NT195AA%2523ABA">HP is offering a US$50.00 instant rebate that brings the price down from $349.99 to just $299.99.</a></p>
