<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/28/5039960/ipad-mini-with-retina-launch-stock-tim-cook">The Verge</a>: The iPad mini with retina display will be launched later in November, and you should plan on camping out if you really want one. In today's earnings call Tim Cook was cautious about availability of the iPad mini with retina display during the fourth quarter calendar year: "... it's not clear if we'll have enough." Not being clear if Apple will have enough of a new product has always been the case and so Cook might simply be stating the obvious, but I wouldn't be surprised if the retina display itself is the bottleneck.</p>
