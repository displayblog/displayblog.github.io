<p><a href="http://www22.verizon.com/investor/investor-consump/groups/events/documents/investorrelation/event_ucm_1_trans.pdf">Verizon</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a period of less than eight weeks, we activated 2.2 million iPhones, and in two weeks, we activated more than 260,000 of our first 4G LTE smartphone, the HTC ThunderBolt, at the premium price of $249.99.</blockquote></p>
<p>27. That's the per minute rate of iPhone sales during those eight weeks. The HTC ThunderBolt was almost 13 per minute. This business of selling phones is insane.</p>
<p>Compared to the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/04/20/att-sells-3-6-million-iphones-in-first-quarter-2011/">3.6 million iPhones AT&T sold</a> in the same time frame, Verizon falls short. But in AT&T's number non-iPhone 4s were included. And there are AT&T iPhone users that are unwilling to pay the ETF and waiting for their contracts to end. It will be interesting to see iPhone sales trends between the two carriers in the next several quarters.</p>
