<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20101130PD219.html">DigiTimes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Overall LCD TV sales during the Black Friday holidays were flat due to the conservative attitude of consumers, as well as lower than expected price drops for LED-backlit LCD TVs, further causing inventory levels for LED-backlit models to increase.</p>
<p>Due to high inventory levels, LED-backlit TVs will be the focus of promotions during the year-end holiday sales.</blockquote></p>
<p>If display performance is important to you remember there are two types of LED-backlit LCD TVs: one is edge-lit and the other is direct-lit. Direct-lit is often referred to as full LED with a bunch of LEDs behind the LCD. This type of LED backlight often comes with local dimming technology that greatly improves contrast. So watch for full LED backlit LCD TVs to go on sale if you're in the market for TV.</p>
