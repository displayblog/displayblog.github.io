That's when it happened. MMOsite:</p>
<blockquote><p>At 8:40 p.m. on that day, a man drove his car under Asia's currently largest LED screen that's placed above The Place in Beijing, opened his notebook PC with an access to the wireless network, and played the online game lying in a prepared lounging chair.</blockquote></p>
<p>He didn't hack into it. He paid, about US$15,000. For 10 minutes of play. Insanity.</p>
<p>Here's something equally insane: the LED sky screen is 250 meters long and 30 meters wide and takes up 7500 square meters. For us folks in the US that's bigger than a standard football field. This LED display is Asia's largest but only the world's #2.</p>
