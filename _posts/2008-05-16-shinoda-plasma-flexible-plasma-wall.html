<p>Shinoda Plasma unveiled a working prototype of a 1mm-thick 125" flexible <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=plasma">plasma</a> wall. The plasma wall is being called a plasma tube array (PTA) where 3 screens are seamlessly integrated. The pixel format is a bit limited as the 125" yields just 960 x 360 but put enough of these together and you'll eventually get to <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a>. The PTA is extremely light at just 3.6kg or 8lbs. Shinoda Plasma is aiming toward the digital signage market and is planning to showcase the 125" PTA at InfoComm 2008 in Las Vegas. Small scale production of a 150" (3m x 2m) version is slated for this fall.</p>
