<p>Samsung's LapFit LCD monitors come in two sizes: 18.5" and 21.5". I'll focus on the smaller 18.5" in this post. I've <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/02/25/samsung-ld220g-215-lcd-monitor/">covered the 21.5" version in another post</a>. The D190S connects using a VGA connection. The D190SU adds the ability to connect via USB or in Samsung speak UbiSync, a DisplayLink implementation. There is another version, the LD190X, that adds a wireless video connection. Trusted Reviews scrutinized the D190S and came away less than impressed. The simple design, touch-sensitive controls especially the power button, and an easy-to-use OSD were liked by TR.</p>
<p>There were some things Ardjuna Seghers, the author of the review, didn't like: noticeable banding of color gradiants, very poor greyscale performance, lost tones, less-than-sharp text probably due to the analog connection. Viewing angles were standard fair for a TN panel while the anti-glare coating was effective in reducing reflections. For folks that require high color fidelity the D190S will not be a good solution but for average office work it gets the job done, especially if you have a netbook or notebook PC. And for just&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&pound;99.99 it is worth trying out.</p>
