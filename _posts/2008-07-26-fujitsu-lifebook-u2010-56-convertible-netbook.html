<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/07/26/fujitsus-lifebook-u2010-gets-new-pics-specs/">Engadget</a>: The Fujitsu Lifebook U2010 is a bit late to the netbook game, but still ahead of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/06/12/dell-e-89-netbook/">Dell</a>, Sony and others. The U2010 is a 5.6-inch netbook with a pixel format of 1024x600 (likely), but tends to be a bit bulky, angular and at times ugly from the pictures. Fujitsu has made this 5.6-inch netbook a bit special relative to others.</p>
<p>The U2010 is a convertible netbook! The 5.6-inch TFT LCD is touch capable (via stylus it seems) and looks very usable in tablet form. The other specifications are fairly normal except for built-in 3G and GPS. That combination should enhance the U2010's functionality and make it an essential tool for road warriors. But, those road warriors better have a lot of okane as the U2010 will cost about US$1300!</p>
