<p>Michael Koerbel shot the film "<a href="http://vimeo.com/12819723">Apple of My Eye</a>" using only the iPhone 4 and edited with the iMovie app. It took him 48 hours and the result is simply amazing. In <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/26/video-quality-comparison-iphone-4-vs-flip-ultra-hd/">Video Quality Comparison: iPhone 4 vs. Flip Ultra HD</a></em> I mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t know what it is but watching the 720p video captured with the iPhone 4 feels weird on my 17-inch MBP. I think maybe my display isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t up to the task with slow liquid crystal response times or it might be the 30fps. If I were to guess it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the 30fps. With this type of video capturing capability on the iPhone 4 the only type of video that would look good is slow panning.</blockquote><br />
I am eating my words now.</p>
