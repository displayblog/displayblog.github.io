<blockquote><p>Basically you just up the card ahead of time for Direct Mode, and it learns to use an ad-hoc wi-fi network to send your pictures directly to your iOS or Android device.</blockquote></p>
<p>The IPS display on the iPads are one of the best displays you can find on any device. If you fancy the iPad as your monitor in your photo processing workflow it might be worth your time to check out this Eye-Fi X2 Mobile SD card.</p>
