<p>Jim Dalrymple, <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2010/10/07/about-this-7-inch-apple-ipad/">The Loop</a> <em>via</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/10/08/dalrymple-7-inches">Daring Fireball</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The fact is, Apple already has a 7-inch iPad. They have had one of the smaller devices since they started making the 9.7-inch iPad that we have now.</p>
<p>To be clearer, the two devices were developed at the same time. They have pretty much the same specs, except, of course, the 9.7-inch model has a higher density screen than its smaller counterpart.</blockquote></p>
<p>Not surprising that Apple already has a 7-inch iPad developed. The part that I'm not so sure about is whether Jim Dalrymple knows what he's talking about regarding "a higher density screen" on the larger compared to the smaller iPad. Density, to me, is resolution, in other words, pixels per inch or PPI. With Apple marketing the pixel density of its Retina Display on the iPhone 4 it is difficult to miss the definition of display density these days.</p>
<p>The 9.7-inch iPad has a pixel density of 131.96 PPI. And Dalrymple is stating that the smaller 7-inch iPad has <em>less</em> pixel density. Hmm...</p>
<p>Typical 7-inch tablets, like the Samsung Galaxy Tab, has a pixel format of 1024x600. That translates to a pixel density or resolution of 169.55 PPI. That's quite a bit higher than the larger 9.7-inch iPad.</p>
<p>Is Dalrymple saying that the 7-inch iPad has even less pixels than the Galaxy Tab? If that <em>is</em> what he is saying, he's most likely wrong.</p>
<p>What probably happened is that Jim Dalrymple didn't exactly know what the term 'density' meant as it relates to displays. You know what I think about the 7-inch iPad? It probably has a higher density screen than the larger counterpart. If I were a betting man, the 7-inch iPad will sport a pixel format of 960x640 or 1024x768.</p>
