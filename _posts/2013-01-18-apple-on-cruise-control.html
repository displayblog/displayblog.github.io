<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/01/17/apple-innovation">John Gruber</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>They&acirc;&euro;&trade;re already the most profitable technology company in the world, and their three major platforms &mdash; iPhone, iPad, and Mac &mdash; are all growing. They don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t <em>need</em> to change a damn thing.</blockquote></p>
<p>There are still a lot of things Apple needs to fine tune with the hardware, software, and services the company already provides. A few iterative innovations I look forward to: retina iPad mini, retina MacBook Air, retina 17-inch MacBook Pro, an all-aluminum unibody iPhone (without plastic), iCloud with DropBox-like file syncing, Match with video, a flatter UI for OS (iOS & OS X) and apps, improved Maps, Calendar, Mail, iTunes with subscriptions and streaming, etc.</p>
