<p><a href="http://investor.google.com/releases/2014/0609.html">Google</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Google Inc. announced today that it has entered into an agreement to buy Skybox Imaging for $500 million in cash, subject to adjustments.</p>
<p>Skybox&acirc;&euro;&trade;s satellites will help keep Google Maps accurate with up-to-date imagery. Over time, we also hope that Skybox&acirc;&euro;&trade;s team and technology will be able to help improve Internet access and disaster relief &mdash; areas Google has long been interested in.</blockquote></p>
<p>Skybox is a Mountain View, Calif.-based manufacturer of private sector satellites, which record high resolution videos and photos of landscapes. Looks to be a good fit for Google Maps.</p>
