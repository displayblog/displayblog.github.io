<p>Andy Ihnatko, for the <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/2788797-417/chrome-notebook-google-file-browser.html">Chicago Sun-Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think I have the answer to that one: nothing. Utterly nothing.</blockquote></p>
<p>Because everything you do on the Cr-48 depends on an Internet connection there is nothing you can do without one. Google is probably working on off-line mode so you can work and play disconnected. In regards to the display:</p>
<blockquote><p>[...] it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a bog-standard 12-inch notebook with a nice color screen [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>I've heard viewing angles are terrible, an indication of poor overall quality. But, it is matte: no glossy reflections.</p>
