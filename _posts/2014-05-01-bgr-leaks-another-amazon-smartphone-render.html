<p><a href="http://bgr.com/2014/05/01/amazon-smartphone-photos-kindle-phone-images-exclusive/">BGR</a>: Glass on both sides. Chamfered edges on the front, like an iPhone. Four cameras on each corner to track your head movements for a 3D user experience. The display is rumored to be a 4.7-inch 1280x720 display. Looks pretty good. Free Amazon Prime for a year? Coming Q3'14.</p>
