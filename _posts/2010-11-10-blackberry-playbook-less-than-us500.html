<p><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-11-10/rim-to-sell-tablet-for-less-than-500-to-take-on-ipad.html">Bloomberg Businessweek</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Research In Motion Ltd., moving into the tablet-computer market for the first time, said it will begin selling its BlackBerry PlayBook for less than $500, suggesting RIM may try to undercut Apple Inc.&acirc;&euro;&trade;s iPad.</blockquote></p>
<p>Less than $500 usually translates to $499. And that's where the first generation iPad's pricing begins. By next year Apple will move onto iPad 2.0 and the tablet market will be remarkably different, again.</p>
