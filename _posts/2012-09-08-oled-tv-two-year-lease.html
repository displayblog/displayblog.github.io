<blockquote><p>LG told me that its 55-inch HDTV is still undergoing testing back home in Korea, with a specific focus on quality and longevity. It doesn't take long to recognize that quality at the outset of an OLED TV's life isn't the problem &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; it's <em>how long</em> you can maintain that level of performance that may be the culprit here. Of course that's just one of many potential stumbling blocks, such as low error tolerances in manufacturing preventing the ramping up of production, but ultimately it's as good an explanation as any for this perpetual wait.</blockquote></p>
<p>It's no secret OLED displays don't last, as long as LCDs. And OLED displays cost <em>way</em> more to make. So what do car manufacturers do with expensive all-electric cars they're not sure will last? Make it lease only, with no option to purchase at the end of the lease. Why not for OLED TVs?</p>
