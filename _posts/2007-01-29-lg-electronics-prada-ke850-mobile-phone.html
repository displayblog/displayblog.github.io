<p>On January 18, LG Electronics (LGE) announced the Prada phone, also known as the KE850. As the name suggests, the Prada phone was codesigned with Prada. According to LGE, the Prada phone is the first to ship with a control system completely based on touch. From the looks of it, there are three buttons on the bottom. The Prada phone will most likely be the subject of comparison to Apple's iPhone, but there are many differences according to an article by <a href="http://www.electronista.com/articles/07/01/18/lg.prada.phone.unveiled/">Electronista</a>. LGE's Prada phone has a 3.0" LCD with a 240 x 400 pixel format versus the iPhone's slightly larger 3.5" LCD with a bit more pixels at 320 x 480. I do like the Prada phone's simple icon design and the black and white colors.</p>

<p>There is no built-in storage like the iPhone but rather gives you the option to expand via microSD. MPEG4, H.263 and H.264 video formats are supported and on the audio front AAC, MP3, WMA and RealAudio formats are good to go. For capturing photos and videos, the Prada phone lets you play with 2 megapixels, the same as the iPhone. Launch date is February for the lucky folks in France, Germany, Italy and the UK. No luck for the US.</p>
