<p>CBS and Walt Disney have shown interesting in distributing its content via Apple's future subscription plan. If true this could mean a massive blow to cable, satellite and any other means of distributing TV content. Walt Disney would make programs available from ABC, The Disney Channel and ABC Family networks. CBS would offer programs from its parent network in addition to CW. NBC Universal, now owned by Comcast, would most likely not be part of any Apple TV subscription deal.</p>
<p>Personally, I don't like to pay for TV. I like the old fashioned way of ad-supported TV, but I do like to pick and choose what I watch and when I watch. And that's why the only way I watch TV today is Hulu.
