  HMX-R10 looks like a cute metallic cyclopes, if ever a cyclopes can be described
  as cute. Or metallic. The HMX-R10 captures <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=1080p&amp;sa=Search#1533\">1080p</a>

  image sensor is hard at work capturing 1080p you can look at the beautiful video
  through the 2.7\" touch-enabled LCD flip-out viewfinder. We can expect the larger

  Lens</strong> The folks who designed the HMX-R10 were looking out for your wrist.
  Try this: Lift up your forearm as if you are holding a can of Coke, don't tilt your
  wrist, and bring it up to your face. That's how I imagine it will be holding the
  HMX-R10. Pretty comfy, isn't it? The F3.5-3.7 6.8-34.0mm lens is angled at 25 degrees
  to prevent your hand and wrist from having to unnaturally contort. "

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Angled Lens</strong> The folks who designed the HMX-R10 were looking out for your wrist. Try this: Lift up your forearm as if you are holding a can of Coke, don't tilt your wrist, and bring it up to your face. That's how I imagine it will be holding the HMX-R10. Pretty comfy, isn't it?

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Price</strong> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OQC0I4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=displ0f-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001OQC0I4">The HMX-R10 is going for $499.99 at Amazon.com</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=displ0f-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B001OQC0I4" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />. You'll have to wait just a little bit since the HMX-R10 will be released on May 15, 2009.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Reviews</strong> There aren't a lot of reviews to be found--probably because the HMX-R10 hasn't been released. But back during CES (that would be January) Samsung was showcasing it. <a href="http://www.camcorderinfo.com/content/Samsung-HMX-R10-First-Impressions-Camcorder-Review-36074.htm#">Kaitlyn Chantry at camcorderinfo had a quick look</a>; <a href="http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/news.phtml/23174/samsung-hmx-r10-hd-camcorder.phtml">Pocket-lint over at the UK got to handle the cute camcorder back in late-March and took a bunch of pictures</a>; <a href="http://fwd.five.tv/gadgets/audio-video/cameras/camcorders/samsung-hmx-r10">The Gadget Show has some video footage of the HMX-R10's slow-mo capability</a> at 300fps and 600fps (both are bad quality in my opinion), regular Full HD video recording and compares them to Sanyo's Xacti VPC-HD2000. The second video coverage is quite informative and you should definitely take a look before pulling the trigger on the HMX-R10.</p></p>
