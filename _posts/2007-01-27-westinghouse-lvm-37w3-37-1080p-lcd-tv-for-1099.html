<p>With $200 instant savings for Westinghouse Digital's LVM-37w3, the 37" LCD TV sporting Full HD 1080p with a pixel format of 1920 x 1080 can be had for just $1099. The 37" LCD TV features a 8ms response time, HDMI with HDCP, DVI with HDCP, VGA, contrast ratio of 1000:1, brightness of 550 cd/m2, lamp life of 60,000 hours, 176-degree viewing angles.</p>
<p><img src="///C:/DOCUME%7E1/Jin/LOCALS%7E1/Temp/moz-screenshot.jpg" /> Seems like a pretty good bargain for what you're getting. But I am still not sold on brands like Westinghouse Digital. I guess I'm just a sucker for brands like Sony, Samsung and Sharp and am willing to pay a bit more for that. But not too much more.</p>
