<p>Sanyo's PLV-Z5 is a LCD-based front projector with an impressive 10,000:1 contrast ratio. Improved gradation is achieved with a twin-iris system that integrates a lens aperture and lamp aperture. Pictures are sharpened by the company's new TopazReal Technology that blends brightness levels of the lamp and LCD panels. There are two HDMI ports, a VGA port for connectivity to computers, and others. At just 9.8 feet you can display a 100" screen with the PLV-Z5. Other details can be found <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/10-30-2006/0004462215&amp;EDATE=">here</a>. A MAP price of $1695.00, 3-year warranty and you can get it now. No word on the resolution in the press release.</p>
<p>Ah, 1280 x 720. Found it <a href="http://www.ausmedia.com.au/sanyo_PLV_z5_projector.htm">here</a>. You wouldn't want a 100" filled with only 1280 x 720 pixels. You wouldn't like it. Although the 10,000:1 contrast ratio and 12-bit processing is impressive, if you want 100" you'll need to wait for a 1920 x 1080 version. Even at that improved resolution, you'd want to sit back a little if you don't want to see the actual pixels.</p>
