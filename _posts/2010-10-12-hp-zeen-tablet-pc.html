<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20101012PD204.html">Digitimes</a>: The HP Zeen is an Android-based tablet PC and is bundled with a printer. The duo was unveiled on October 11th in Taiwan but is not on the market yet. The 7-inch Zeen is endowed with TouchSmart so you can print and manage all of your printing needs. Gmail, Android Market and other multimedia apps have been removed from the Zeen, presumably because it should only be used for print-related stuff. Weird. </p>
