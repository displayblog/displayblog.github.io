<p>The NX system from Samsung does not have a reflex mirror, similar to the Micro Four Thirds system. What is different from Micro Four Thirds is the use of APS-C-sized image sensor that are found in most traditional DSLRs. By eliminating the reflex mirror, Samsung has reduced the flange-back (lens mount to sensor) distant from 45.5mm on its GX-20 to just 25.5mm on the NX10. The all-live view system allows for much thinner bodies. Here are the specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>15.1MP APS-C CMOS Image Sensor (14.6MP Effective Pixels)</li>
<li>720P H.264 30FPS Movie Capture</li>
<li>Contrast-Detect Autofocus</li>
<li>3.0-inch AMOLED 614,000-Dot PenTile Pixel Format</li>
<li>912,000-Dot Electronic Viewfinder</li>
<li>30mm F2 Pancake and 18-55mm Standard Zoom Options</li><br />
</ul><br />
Other lens options will include 30mm, 18-55mm, 50-200mm at launch. And there will be two dedicated flashguns: SEF20A, SEF42A. Now if Samsung makes a Panasonic GF-1-like NX system-based camera, I think that would shake things up quite a bit.
