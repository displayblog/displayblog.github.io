<p><a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2011/03/11/the-four-big-steps-to-cutting-the-cord/">Matt Burns</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Do it! Cut the cord and free yourself from the tyranny of the cable mafia. The movement is slowly gaining traction but the whole task is daunting. What do you do next? Where does your TV content come from? What are the options? So many questions you need answered before you take the scissors to the coax line.</blockquote></p>
<p>Burns isn't recommending you stop watching TV. No, he's helping you save money by showing you ways to get the same TV for less: over the air, Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu Plus services using hardware like Boxee Box, Roku, XBox, Wii, etc. Some good advice, but I have a better idea. If you want to save some <em>serious</em> money there's a better and more simple way: stop watching TV. </p>
<p>I did, for the most part. I will confess I do watch a bit using Hulu. The two programs are Glee and Lie to Me. Which reminds me I need to watch the latest episode of Glee...</p>
