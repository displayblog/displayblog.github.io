<p><a href="http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_mac/family/macbook_air?mco=MTE4MTY">Apple</a>: The MacBook Air with a 1.8GHz Intel Core 2 Duo CPU and 64GB SSD is now $2598.00,  from $3098.00. That's a $500 drop. The base MacBook Air with the same CPU running at a cooler 1.6GHz and a 80GB 1.8" 4200RPM HDD is still at $1799. The CPU upgrade from 1.6GHz to 1.8GHz has come down $100 from $300 to $200 while the 64GB SSD option came down from an unheard of $999 to $599, a $400 drop. The $500 price drop makes the MacBook Air a whole lot more competitive with others like <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/01/30/lenovo-x300-133-led-backlight-notebook-pc/">Lenovo's X300</a>. But <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/06/10/voodoo-envy-133-133-notebook-pc/">VOODOO's Envy 133</a> still has the lower price at just $2099.</p>

<p>The majority of the price drop is the result of overall aggressive SSD price declines. Take for instance OCZ's newest Core Series SSD prices. OCZ's 128GB SATA II 2.5" SSDs are just $479. That is roughly half the price and double the capacity of what Apple was charging for its 64GB SSD.</p>

<p>I don't have a crystal ball, but with SSDs based on semiconductor technology, capacity and performance should roughly follow Moore's Law. I can't wait to see the next MacBook Air with a 2.4GHz Intel Core 2 Duo with 256GB SSD and a 1440 x 900 13.3" TFT LCD for $1999.00 next January! (Just wishing.)</p>
