<blockquote><p>Here's the real kicker: <strong>it's fast</strong>. It's smooth. It renders at 60FPS unless you have a lot going on. It's unequivocally better than performance on OS X, further leading me to believe that Apple really needs to overhaul how animations are done. Even when I turn Transparency off in OS X, Mission Control isn't completely smooth. Here, even after some Aero Glass transparency has been added in, everything is smooth. It's remarkable, and it makes me believe in the 12-inch MacBook more than ever before.</blockquote></p>
<p>This is how I would rate hardware and software quality for Apple and Microsoft:</p>
<p>Apple hardware: 9<br />
Apple software: 6</p>
<p>Microsoft hardware: 8<br />
Microsoft software: 8</p>
<p>I rate Microsoft hardware slightly lower than Apple's because Apple's ability to refine the smallest of details is a step up from Microsoft's. Few companies equal Apple in the hardware space when it comes to refinement.</p>
<p>Software is a different story. Apple's software, including OS X and software applications like iTunes, Numbers, Keynote, etc., are at best mediocre. At worst, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/11/28/os-x-10-10-yosemite-absolutely-frustrating/">it is maddening</a>. Take a look at the reviews &mdash; by both professional and regular folks &mdash; and it is obvious: Apple makes mediocre software. (To be clear, I'm focused on desktop software; iOS gives me a better user experience than Android, hands down. Windows I don't know since I haven't used a Windows phone, yet.)</p>
<p>Microsoft never quits and the company never quit on Windows. The latest version, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/7/8568473/windows-10-last-version-of-windows">which will also be the last</a>, is Windows 10 and it looks like a winner. (I'm running Windows 7, plan to skip 8, and jump directly to Windows 10.) Keep in mind the Windows 10 King installed on his 2015 MacBook is an Insider Preview edition; the finished version of Windows 10 should be excellent.</p>
