According to the Chinese-language Commercial Times and reported by <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20100715PB200.html">Digitimes</a>, HTC (TAIEX: 2498) is expected to launch six new smartphones in the US and Europe significantly impacting fourth quarter 2010 results. The image above is HTC's Aria (similar to Wildfire) sporting a smaller 3.2-inch capacitive touch display and running Android 2.1 on AT&amp;T (NYSE: T).</p>
<p>For Europe, HTC is planning to introduce its Vision dual-core Android-based smartphone in October. The company's Mondrian, a Windows Phone 7 (WP7), in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>There isn't much information about HTC's Vision, but there is some. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/07/04/htc-vision-with-android-full-qwerty-in-the-wild/">Engadget</a> has posted up a blurry shot of the QWERTY-equipped Android smartphone from HTC sporting a 3.7-inch display, 1 GHz CPU and Android 2.1 with Sense.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=681659&amp;page=18">xda developers</a>, the HTC Mondrian looks to sport a largish 4.3-inch 800x480 display from Optrex, a 1.3GHz Scorpion core QSD8650A/B Snapdragon from Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), a digital compass but with no built-in QWERTY keyboard.</p>
<p>HTC is targeting the US with two new Android-based smartphones for T-Mobile: the Vanguard and Emerald in addition to an as-yet-unnamed WP7 model. For AT&amp;T, HTC has a WP7-based smartphone in the works and should be available in November.</p>
<p>The HTC Vanguard is probably a rebadged Vision according to <a href="http://www.androidguys.com/2010/07/10/tmos-htc-vision-htc-vanguard-21-mbps-hspa-smartphone/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+androidguyscom+(AndroidGuys)">AndroidGuys</a> and sport 4G capabilities on T-Mobile. The Emerald should be a dual-core Android smartphone as well. Quite likely since Luis Pineda, SVP of product management at Qualcomm, revealed during CES that there will be at least two more iterations of the Snapdragon running up to 1.5GHz in 2010. True to his word, Qualcomm announced the first sampling of its first dual-core Snapdragon and Mobile Station Modem (MSM) chipsets on June 1st.
