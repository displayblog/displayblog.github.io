<p>The Apple Core at <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/apple/iphone-rules-in-smartphone-customer-satisfaction-shocking/8775">ZDNet</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Meanwhile, Carton also said a third of non-AT&T smartphone purchasers said they would have bought an iPhone if it was available from their current carriers. Ouch. And while the Motorola phones came in second place (a surprise he said), almost 40 percent of these owners wished they had an iPhone.</blockquote></p>
<p>Carton is Paul Carton, VP of Research at ChangWave, which is the company that recently surveyed 1,212 smartphone owners. The crux of the survey result was that 84% rated the 32GB iPhone 4 "Very Satisfied" leading the pack by a large margin. But this was more interesting to me: 40% of Motorola owners wish they had an iPhone. Message to Apple: get the iPhone on every network.</p>
