<p>Michael Gartenberg's <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/31/entelligence-lessons-from-the-ipad-launch/"><em>Entelligence: Lessons from the iPad launch</em></a> details four important lessons to learn from Apple's iPad launch:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define what your product does.</li>
<li>Leverage what you've done before.</li>
<li>Make your product additive to your ecosystem.</li>
<li>Solve a problem, don't be a feature.</li><br />
</ol><br />
Gartenberg ends with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Vendors competing with Apple in this space are going to need to understand these lessons and in many cases change not only their current products, but the story they tell.</blockquote></p>
