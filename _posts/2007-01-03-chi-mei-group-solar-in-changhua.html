<p>The Chi Mei Group is considering Changhua for a manufacturing base for solar cells, the country government and Bes Engineering have confirmed. Representatives from Chi Mei visited the Changhua coastal industrial park and made inquiries regarding the possibility of establishing a solar cell production facility. The solar industry is just about to take off and it is not surprising to see LCD manufacturers consider outfitting some of its capacity to manufacture solar cells.</p>
