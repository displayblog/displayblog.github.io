<p>Scott Wilson, founder of Chicago-based MINIMAL, on the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1104350651/tiktok-lunatik-multi-touch-watch-kits">LunaTik</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>LunaTik is designed and intended to be a premium conversion kit for someone that wants to dedicate their Nano to being a watch and the newest conversation piece with their friends. It is forged from Aerospace Grade Aluminum and then machined via CNC into its final form.</blockquote></p>
<p>In addition: high-grade silicone rubber straps, solid stainless steel hardware and built in the same factories that make Nixon, Diesel, Vestal, and Nike.</p>

<p>Beautiful, isn't it? The LunaTik will be shipping to KickStarter backers by mid-January 2011. Can't wait.</p>
