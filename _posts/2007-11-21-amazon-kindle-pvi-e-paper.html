<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FI73MA/?tag=displ0f-20">Amazon Kindle</a>, <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/displays/a20071121PD202.html">DigiTimes</a>: Amazon has come out with its own-branded e-book reader called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FI73MA/?tag=displ0f-20">Kindle</a>.  The Kindle has a 6" electro-phoretic display (EPD) also called a bistable nematic display (binem) or electronic paper display (also EPD). The EPD is made by Taiwan's Prime View International (PVI). PVI and Amazon has been working at developing Kindle for 3 years. Although many are not happy with the $399 price and especially the product design, Kindle is a step toward shifting the way we read books, magazines, newspapers and blogs. It won't be easy to change the way we read, a habit that has been around for a very long time, but Amazon's Kindle is a much more powerful attempt than that of Sony's Reader Digital Book.</p>
<p>With Kindle, Amazon has freed the use of an e-book reader from the PC. Books, magazines, newspapers are purchased directly on the Kindle device and downloaded via Amazon's Whispernet, a cellular data connection built on top of Sprint's EVDO network. Sony's Reader Digital Book, on the other hand, requires a connection with a PC to load books, etc. I will note that Sony's offering is much easier on the eye than Amazon's Kindle. But I do think Kindle is much more usable, especially the slide-select user interface that replaces a ton of buttons on the Reader Digital Book. The 6" EPD sports a pixel format of 600 x 800, which is good enough for most reading applications. Graphics will not look as good as they do on your notebook or desktop PC, but should be decent enough as the EPD has 4 levels of gray. PVI also supplies its EPDs for Sony's aReader. PVI has already developed an improved version with 8 levels of gray with 16 levels geared for 2008.</p>
