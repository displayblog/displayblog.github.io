<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/04/05/softbanks-ceo-donating-10-billion-to-japans-quake-affected-re/">Engadget</a>: Masayoshi Son, CEO of Softbank, announced that he will donate &Acirc;&yen;10 billion (about US$120 million) to victims of the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that has devastated Japan. He will also donate all of his future compensation as CEO of Softbank. The company itself will be donating &Acirc;&yen;1 billion as well. More than generous and a concrete sign of leadership in a time of crisis.</p>
