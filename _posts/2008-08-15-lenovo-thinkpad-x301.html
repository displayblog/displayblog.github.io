<p><a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/hardware/desktop/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=210100340">InformationWeek</a>: The Lenovo ThinkPad X301 is the successor to the X300, a worthy competitor to Apple's MacBook Air. The X301 will probably look almost identical to the X300 but the exciting upgrades are mostly internal. The 13.3" TFT LCD with a LED backlight sporting a pixel format of 1440x900 stays, as it should: ultra-thin with more pixels than the standard 1280x800, a winning combo. The CPU is an as-yet-unannounced Intel ULV CPU that will come in two speeds: 1.2GHz (U9300) and 1.4GHz (U9400). The X301 will use faster DDR3 RAM, up to 2GB. The 64GB SSD limit on the X300 will be supplanted by a 128GB version that will be available in September. All of these internal enhancements lead to an overall performance boost of 20%.</p>
