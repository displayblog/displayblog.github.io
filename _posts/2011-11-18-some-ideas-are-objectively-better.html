<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://www.splatf.com/2011/11/david-cole">David Cole who was interviewed by Dan Frommer</a>. <a href="http://blog.millsbaker.net/post/11186748510/design-compromise">Mills Baker</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>That is: creative ideas embody whole explanatory and speculative matrices, even in their minor details. Compromises dilute the implicit, interdependent elements which account for the form and content of creative ideas, introducing new elements (from others, from committees) which derive from wholly different notions about the problems being solved, the relations between the elements involved, the speculations which are justified by experience and evidence, and so on.</blockquote></p>
<p>Simply put: Great ideas that are compromised are crap.</p>
<p>And that is why in the process of ruthlessly protecting the entirety of an amazing idea from grand vision to microscopic detail lesser ideas and their possessors are crushed, for the better.</p>
