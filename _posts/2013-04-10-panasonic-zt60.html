<p>The Panasonic ZT60 will remain the best plasma TV the company makes. Panasonic Display Vice President Kiyoshi Okamoto confirmed to <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/10/4210556/panasonic-ceases-plasma-panel-development-will-continue-to-make-tvs">The Verge</a> further plasma display panel research and development will be no more.</p>
<p>Over the years a lot of my friends have sought my advice on what TV to buy. To make sure I give them the best advice I ask a lot of questions. One of the questions is, "Are you a sports nut?" If they answer yes, I recommend they purchase a plasma TV, a Panasonic plasma TV. A plasma TV has no detectable motion blur, a feature money can't buy on even the best LCD TVs. Sure, it consumes a bit more energy, but you can save a lot of money by going with a plasma TV over a high end LCD TV.</p>
<p>The end is near for plasma. It's a bit sad. Even though Panasonic is diverting research and development toward OLED TVs, it will be many years before we see price/performance ratios close to plasma TVs. Panasonic will sell plasma TVs "into 2014 at the very least," but if I were a sports nut, I'd make sure to grab the biggest ZT60.</p>
