<p><a href="http://www.prad.de/en/news/shownews_tv2835.html">PRAD</a> is reporting that Gene Munster from Piper Jaffray thinks <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=apple&amp;sa=Search#1363">Apple</a> may enter the TV market with its own set in 2011. Munster further postulates that the TV from Apple will not be merely a display device but also function as a DVR, game console and a connection hub for Macs and iPhones/iPods via a wireless connection. The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=iphone&amp;sa=Search#1348">iPhone</a> and iPod would, of course, be used as remote controls and game controllers. A new <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22apple+tv%22&amp;sa=Search#1292">Apple TV</a> with digital recording capabilities (requiring a video input port) is also soon to appear in the next few months. Munster also forecasts a TV subscription model from Apple called an "iTunes TV Pass" for US$30-40/mo. He also thinks 6.6 million Apple TVs will sell in 2009, more the 3x in 2008. What Munster is mustering up seems to be a pipe dream and goes against design principles based on delivering a focused experience for different products.</p>
<p>If Apple decides to build a TV it will merely be a display, an awesome display with plenty of sex appeal, but merely. I'm not sure if you could even call it a TV since it won't have TV tuners. The extremely simple TV will be a display for the Mac, the iPhone, the iPod, the Apple TV and any other video source like a Blu-ray player, satellite, cable, etc. Unlike other TVs the resolution will be considerable: I'm thinking <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=4k2k&amp;sa=Search#901">4K2K</a> considerable. Since Apple uses <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=ips&amp;sa=Search#1379">IPS</a> technology for its high-end offerings, the TV set will most likely continue with that trend if it is a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22lcd+tv%22&amp;sa=Search#1348">LCD TV</a> at all. Wireless connectivity? Most likely. Wired connectivity? Of course. The TV from Apple will be designed to offer an amazing "lean back" experience so I agree with Munster: the iPhone or iPod touch will be used as a remote control.</p>
