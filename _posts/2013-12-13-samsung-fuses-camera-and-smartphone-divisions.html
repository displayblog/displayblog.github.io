<blockquote><p>Samsung Electronics integrated the Digital Imaging Business Division, in charge of cameras, with the Wireless Business Division. Samsung Electronics began to create synergies between smartphones and cameras in a bid to capture the largest share of the global mirrorless camera market in 2015.</blockquote></p>
<p>I would think the bigger market potential is adding higher quality optics and image sensors into its Galaxy line of smartphones. A crazier idea would be to make its Galaxy smartphones capable of using Samsung's NX lenses.</p>
