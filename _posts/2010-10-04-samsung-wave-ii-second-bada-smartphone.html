<p>It was just a few days ago that I posted up <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/10/01/engadget-samsung-wave-s8500/">a review done by Engadget on the Samsung Wave (S8500)</a>. And now comes the second version: Wave II. The biggest difference is the display. The original Wave had a 3.3-inch AMOLED. The second Wave, or Wave II, sports a 3.7-inch Super LCD. The larger LCD packs in 800x480 pixels.</p>
<p>This is an interesting development. The original Wave gets a small AMOLED and then the next generation Wave II gets a bigger Super LCD. I thought Samsung was moving toward 100% AMOLED with its own brand in smartphones. Maybe only high-end Samsung smartphones will get its Super AMOLED displays.</p>
<p>Other technical specs seem to be the same. The diamond-shaped button on the original Wave seems to have been rounded out a bit on the Wave II. Source: <a href="http://www.samsung.de/de/news/read.aspx?pmguid=5025eb57-5f14-4a79-b894-23c65342d7bb">Samsung</a> (German)</p>
