<p><a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3019401/how-i-taught-steve-jobs-to-put-design-first">Hartmut Esslinger</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I explained that to make design a core element of Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s corporate strategy, it would have to be seen as a leadership issue; world-class design can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t work its way up from the bottom, watered down by the motivations and egos of every layer of management it passes through. I also offered a number of examples of corporate designers&mdash;especially in the United States&mdash;who were being compromised by the need to report to lower levels. Steve looked a bit irritated when I told him that my initial observations of Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s design process revealed exactly the same pattern of structurally determined mediocrity.</blockquote></p>
<p>At a company like Apple where financial and human resources are almost unlimited, designers should design the impossible and let engineers do their magic.</p>
