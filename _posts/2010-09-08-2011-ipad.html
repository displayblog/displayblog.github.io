<p>Here are my guesses to what the next iPad (2011 iPad) will feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>9.7-inch IPS LCD with 2048x1536 with optically laminated touch layer</li>
<li>Dual cameras for FaceTime</li>
<li>Dual-core A4 CPU</li>
<li>Lighter and thinner</li><br />
</ul><br />
That pixel format of 2048x1536 is simply doubling the horizontal and vertical pixels for the current format of 1024x768: exactly what Apple did with the 3.5-inch LCD found on iPhones previous to the iPhone 4. The pixels went from 480x320 to 960x640. That pixel doubling (or quadrupling when counting total pixels) will result in a resolution of about 264 PPI. That's quite a bit less than the 326 PPI found on the iPhone 4 (and the new iPod touch), but I think Apple will include the 264-PPI 9.7-inch IPS LCD in the family of Retina Displays. If my guess is right we'll be looking at one of the highest density displays ever to be manufactured that's that big.</p>
<p>The total number of pixels on the 9.7-inch Retina Display will be 3.1 million so I'm hoping the back-facing camera will be at least 3.1 megapixels to make use of all those pixels. Optical lamination should get rid of air pocket and make the display even better. A dual-core A4 CPU should make things even snappier and may even generate less heat and consume less power. At 1.5 pounds the current iPad isn't considered heavy but when you're a heavy reader it could be. So my guess is that the iPad will lose some weight and be slimmed down especially in thickness.</p>
