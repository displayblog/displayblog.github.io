<p><a href="http://e.nikkei.com/e/fr/tnks/Nni20110803D03JF673.htm">Nikkei</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the last fiscal year ended March, 70% of Hitachi TV models were produced by overseas manufacturers through outsourcing. Hitachi has only one TV factory in Japan, and is now considering discontinuing production there. All the TV sets currently made at the plant in Gifu Prefecture, central Japan, are sold in the domestic market.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Japanese domestic market looks for "Made in Japan" as an indicator of quality. Maybe that is no longer true. Or Hitachi is also considering existing the Japanese domestic market.</p>
