<p><a href="http://gizmodo.com/5686161/samsung-galaxy-tab-review-a-pocketable-train-wreck">Gizmodo</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Screen is pretty killer. The pixel density&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;1024x600 pixels packed into a 7-inch display&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;makes everything from reading to watching video seriously pleasant. (Put another way: Reading Kindle books feels better than on the iPad.) The viewing angles are vast like the BP oil spill. The colors are nice and saturated&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;at least when you turn off the "power saving mode," which douses the screen with a sickly yellow hue.</blockquote></p>
<p>But Flash messes up the experience:</p>
<blockquote><p>The browser is miserable, at least when Flash is enabled. It goes catatonic, scrolling is laggy, and it can get laughably bad. When better browsing is half the reason to go for a larger screen, that's insanity.</blockquote></p>
<p>The bottom line:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Tab is like a compromise's evil twin, merging the worst of a tablet and the worst of a phone. It has all of the input problems of a tablet, with almost none of the consumption benefits.</blockquote></p>
<p>There is no doubt the Samsung Galaxy Tab packs a beautiful display. It probably isn't as good as the 9.7-inch IPS LCD used in the iPad but still very good. Apple chose to rid its iDevices of Flash. Maybe Samsung should have done the same. The smaller 7-inch size seem not have worked well for Gizmodo.</p>
