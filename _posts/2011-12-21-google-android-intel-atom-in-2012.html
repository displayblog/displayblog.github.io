<p><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/39378">Tom Simonite, MIT Technology Review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The phone prototype seen by <em>Technology Review</em> was similar in dimensions to the iPhone 4 but noticeably lighter, probably because the case was made with more plastic and less glass and metal. It was running the version of Google's operating system shipping with most Android phones today, known as Gingerbread [...].</p>
<p>The phone was powerful and pleasing to use, on a par with the latest iPhone and Android handsets. It could play Blu-Ray-quality video and stream it to a TV if desired; Web browsing was smooth and fast.</blockquote></p>
<p>Codenamed Medfield the 32-nm system-on-chip (SOC) Atom combines three separate chips into one reducing power consumption to ARM levels. Intel claims Medfield-powered smartphones sport faster browsing, better graphics performance, while consuming less power than the three best that are out there today. 2012 might be the year WinTel-like smartphone and tablet monopolies are forged by Google and Intel.</p>
