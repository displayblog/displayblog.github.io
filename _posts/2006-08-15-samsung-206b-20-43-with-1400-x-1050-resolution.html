<p>Up until only a few months ago, a 20" LCD monitor with a 4:3 aspect ratio meant that the resolution was 1600 x 1200. With 1.92 megapixels, yields weren't as high as the lower resolution 17" and 19" with only 1280 x 1024 (1.31 megapixels) resolution. Lower yields mean higher prices and that's why even to this day a 20" 4:3 with 1600 x 1200 resolution goes for around $400. Bring down the resolution and the yields go up. That means lower prices.</p>
<p>Enter Samsung's 206B. It's a 20" 4:3 LCD monitor but with less resolution: 1400 x 1050. You won't be able to fit 1080p content without massive scaling, but you can view 1280 x 720 (720p HD) content without a hitch.</p>

<p>The price is on the high side though at 442,900 won or about US$458. But bear in mind that most prices for electronic gear in South Korea compared to those in the US are very very expensive indeed. The 205B, the 1600 x 1200 version, goes for 453,200 won, or about $469. Prices might be higher than it should be at the moment just because it is a newer product (hence the 206B name, indicating a newer model, but misleading the consumer into thinking it has better specifications than the 205B).</p>
<p>The 206B is not available in the US at the moment, but expect to see lower resolution LCD monitors going for less than the higher resolution brethrens in the US. Dell's 2007FP, a 20" LCD monitor with 1600 x 1200 resolution, is going for $391 (at the moment). Imagine for a moment and let's say Dell had a 2008FP, a 20" LCD monitor with 1400 x 1050 resolution. I would guess the price would be around $350, or less.</p>
<p>Personally, I like high-resolution screens and would gladly fork over a bit more of my hard-earned money. Of course, I wouldn't even consider a 4:3. That's old. I'd go with a 1920 x 1200 resolution wide LCD monitor.</p>
