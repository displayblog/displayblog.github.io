<p><a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/08/the_disciplined_pursuit_of_less.html">Greg McKeown, Harvard Business Review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why don't <em>successful</em> people and organizations automatically become <em>very</em> successful? One important explanation is due to what I call "the clarity paradox," which can be summed up in four predictable phases:</p>
<p>Phase 1: When we <em>really</em> have clarity of purpose, it leads to success.<br />
Phase 2: When we have success, it leads to more options and opportunities.<br />
Phase 3: When we have increased options and opportunities, it leads to diffused efforts.<br />
Phase 4: Diffused efforts undermine the very clarity that led to our success in the first place.</p>
<p>Curiously, and overstating the point in order to make it, <em>success is a catalyst for failure</em>.</blockquote></p>
<p>I guess the trick is to perpetually stay at Phase 1.</p>
