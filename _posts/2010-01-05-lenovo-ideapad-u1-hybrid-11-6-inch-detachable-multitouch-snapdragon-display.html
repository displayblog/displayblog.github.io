<p><strong>SMARTBOOK INTEGRATED:</strong> Lenovo's 11.6-inch IdeaPad U1 Hybrid is quite unique: the resistive multitouch display is detachable and switches to the company's Skylight UI (similar to the smartbook) when detached. The switch from Windows 7 to Skylight takes just 3 seconds and then connectivity is via 3G. The multitouch display is powered by a Snapdragon CPU and can be used as an ereader too with its built-in accelerometer. Engadget took it for a spin:</p>
<ul>
<li>Far from flawless multitouch experience: required multiple double taps to engage.</li>
<li>Terrible viewing angles on the 11.6-inch LCD: disappearing act at 45 degrees.</li><br />
</ul><br />
<strong>VIEWING ANGLES:</strong> But bear in mind it was a very early pre-production unit that they were testing. I do hope Lenovo recognizes that near-perfect viewing angles are paramount when it comes to display can be viewed either in portrait or landscape mode. Other specs include: Intel CULV CPU, 128GB SSD, Windows 7 Home Premium. The IdeaPad U1 Hybrid is slated for a June release.
