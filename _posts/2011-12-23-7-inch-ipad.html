<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://www.bgr.com/2011/12/23/apple-reportedly-has-no-plans-for-a-7-inch-ipad-ipad-2-price-to-drop-when-ipad-3-launches">BGR</a>. Wedge Partners analyst Brian Blair:</p>
<blockquote><p>Don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t expect a 7-incher. While we believe Apple has tested 7-inch screen prototypes for over a year, we don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t currently expect the company to release anything in the 7-inch size in 2012.</blockquote></p>
<p>I think a 7-inch iPad can be extremely successful in Japan, South Korea, parts of Western Europe, and San Francisco, Cali. These are places where both men and women carry purses. But I'm with Blair: I don't think there's going to be a 7-inch iPad.</p>
