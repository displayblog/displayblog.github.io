<p>Dell just improved its 30" LCD monitor. The UltraSharp 3007WFP-HC has a color gamut of 92% NTSC, way more than your typical 72%. Dell didn't go with a LED backlight but instead used a Wide Cold-Cathode Fluorescent Lighting (W-CCFL) backlight. For people that appreciate better color fidelity the improved color should receive a warm welcome. The 3007WFP-HC has a resolution of 2560 x 1600, a response time of 8ms, four USB 2.0 ports, an integrated 9-in-2 media card reader and is height adjustable with tilt and swivel capabilities. As far as I know, the 30" TFT LCD panel comes from LG.Philips LCD and maybe we will see Apple's 30" get the bump in color gamut as well. What I would have liked to have seen is an LED-backlight on the 3007WFP. Maybe it's on Dell's future roadmap.</p>
