<p>Corning's Gorilla glass is chemically strengthened and designed to provide protection as a cover glass for displays. Demand for the company's Gorilla glass is expected to grow significantly and the company is responding. </p>
<p>On August 03, 2010 Corning announced that its board of directors approved a US$180 million capital expenditure at its Harrodsburg, Kentucky manufacturing facility to add capacity for Gorilla glass and allow production of thin-film photovoltaic glass. James P. Clappin, president, Corning&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Precision Glass businesses:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are on track to reach sales in excess of $250 million this year and sales could approach the $1 billion mark in 2011. We are making Gorilla glass manufacturing and technology investments today to meet the growing market need of the future.</blockquote></p>
<p>Gorilla glass will be more widely used for LCD TV applications. With a much larger dimension the demand for Gorilla glass should grow exponentially in the near future. Clappin expects revenues from Gorilla glass to hit $250 million in 2010 and then to $1 billion in 2011.</p>
<p><strong>Thin-Film Photovoltaic Glass</strong><br />
Corning's Harrodsburg facility will begin producing specialty glass for thin-film photovoltaics using its fusion manufacturing process. Corning expects substantial improvements in energy conversion efficiency and weight reduction while maintaining product strength and long-term reliability.</p>
<p>Corning&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Harrodsburg facility opened in 1952 and originally manufactured various ophthalmic products including photochromic glass. In the mid-1980s small-generation LCD glass substrates were produced until recently shifting to Gorilla and photovoltaic glass. The facility is Corning&acirc;&euro;&trade;s glass-melting technology center collaborating with the company's Sullivan Park Research and Technology Center to develop advanced glass for display, photovoltaic and other applications.</p>
<p>The state of Kentucky and Gov. Steven L. Beshear&acirc;&euro;&trade;s office through the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority will assist up to $4.5 million in Kentucky Business Investment incentives and up to $1 million in tax rebates for construction costs.
