<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/03/25/visceral-apps">John Gruber</a>. Rob Foster, <a href="http://mysterioustrousers.com/news/2013/3/25/visceral-apps-and-you">Mysterious Trousers</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I believe that even if you designed the most perfect and useful app possible, that the act of adding in these visceral elements will make people love your app on an even deeper level.</blockquote></p>
<p>What makes apps greater than great? Foster points to visceral elements and I think he's right. He points to Angry Birds, Clear, and Path as examples of endorphin releasing visceral apps.</p>
