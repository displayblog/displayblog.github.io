  alt=\"Griffin Clarifi iPhone 3G Case: Clear Close-Up Pictures!\" /></p>\r\n\r\nI
  don't talk much about cases because I usually don't use one. It's not that I don't
  want to take care of my precious <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=iphone-3g\">iPhone
  3G</a> but I do like the way it feels and a case would just ruin that whole
  touchy-feely-thingy. But I think I might have to get a case. Not just to protect
  my iPhone 3G but to do something else that I've been trying hopelessly to do for
  a long long time. The original iPhone had the same problem.\r\n\r\nWhen I'm looking
  at car magazines or... mmm... actually that's all I read when I'm at Barnes &amp;
  Noble, I like to take pictures of information that I think are useful. For instance
  a spark plug that increases horsepower (if you're wondering: <a href=\"http://www.pulstar.com/\">Pulstar</a>).
  Many times the picture just isn't good enough for me to figure out what the text
  is saying. The iPhones definitely have a problem with closeup photos. I can pull
  it back a bit to get more focus but then the text is too tiny and I still can't
  read it. The folks over at Griffin has come to the rescue in its Clarifi iPhone
  3G case: it has a built-in close-up lens that you can flick on. The results? "

<p>Gizmodo did a "lightning review" on the Clarifi and came out impressed that it actually works and that it worked better than the he (<a href="http://gizmodo.com/people/markwilson/posts/">Mark Wilson</a>) expected. <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5079592/lightning-review-griffin-clarifi-iphone-case">Hop on over there to check out the pictures he took</a>. I am certainly impressed. The Clarifi with the close-up lens enable the iPhone to take some really sharp close-up pictures. You can also get <a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/clarifi">more information about the Clarifi at Griffin</a>. It goes for $34.99 at the site.
