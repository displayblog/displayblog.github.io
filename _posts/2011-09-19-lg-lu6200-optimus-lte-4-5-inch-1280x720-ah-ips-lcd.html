<p>The LG Optimus LTE might be the first smartphone to sport a 1280x720 pixel format. The 8-bit 4.5-inch Advanced High Performance In-Plane Switching (AH-IPS) LCD with 1280x720 pixels is good for a resolution of 326 ppi*. Which coincidentally is the same 326 ppi found on the current reigning champ the 3.5-inch IPS LCD Retina Display on the iPhone 4.</p>
<p>AH-IPS recently beat out Super AMOLED Plus. As reported by <a href="http://blog.gsmarena.com/lgs-yet-to-be-launched-4-5-ah-ips-mobile-display-scores-an-award-by-outclassing-samsung-galaxy-siis-super-amoled-unit/">GSM Arena</a>, the LG Display-built 4.5-inch AH-IPS with 1280x720 had better color accuracy, lower power consumption (624 mW v. 1130 mW), and higher brightness (600 nits v. 300+ nits) receiving the prestigious Quality & Performance Mark from Intertek.</p>
<p>LG is branding the 4.5-inch 1280x720 AH-IPS LCD as True HD. Rightly so. Even with an equivalent 326 ppi resolution the LG Optimus LTE trumps the iPhone 4 Retina Display in one very important aspect: 720p HD content is viewed without any scaling. You get <em>pure</em> 720p. </p>
<p>The LG Optimus LTE will be available on September 26 on South Korea's LG U+ LTE network.</p>
<p>&mdash;</p>
<p>* Many news outlets are indicating the resolution at 329 ppi, which might mean the AH-IPS LCD is slightly smaller in the range of 4.46 - 4.47 inches.</p>
