<p>[ <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/01/dell-xps-15-review-a-bigger-version-of-the-best-pc-laptop/">Ars Technica</a> ] Peter Bright:</p>
<blockquote><p>The fine-looking 4K screen starts at $1,799, which gets you 8GB RAM and a 256GB SSD, as well as the discrete graphics. I think this is probably the best-rounded system.</blockquote></p>
<p>The 15.6-inch IPS LCD can be equipped with an optional 4K display with a pixel format of 3840x2160, good for a resolution of 282 ppi. And the massive number of pixels are powered by a discrete NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M GPU with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM. The XPS 15 posted some solid benchmark numbers, beating the competition in most.</p>
<p>The thin bezels around the display make the XPS 15 look nice, nicer than most MacBooks (Airs and Pros) except for maybe the 12-inch MacBook. The only weird feature on the XPS 15 is the location of the webcam: it's underneath the display. I guess the bezel was too thin to put a camera up there.</p>
