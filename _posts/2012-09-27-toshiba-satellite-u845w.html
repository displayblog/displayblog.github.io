<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/09/putting-the-wide-in-widescreen-the-toshiba-satellite-u845w-reviewed/">Andrew Cunningham, Ars Technica</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The 21:9 1792x768 screen is marketed as being ideal for two things: watching movies in their native aspect ratio, and placing two windows next to each other. The screen's diagonal size is 14.4", but the extreme aspect ratio actually makes the U845W nearer the height of an 11" notebook while still retaining the width of a 14" or 15" model.</blockquote></p>
<p>Two windows next to each other would each have a pixel format of 896x768. That wouldn't be wide enough for a lot of work, including updating this blog. The ideal width for the Toshiba Satellite U845W would have been 2048x768, making each of the two windows 1024x768. But that would make it a little wider than 21:9. So the U845W is good, and better than almost all other notebooks, for just one thing: watching 21:9 film.</p>
