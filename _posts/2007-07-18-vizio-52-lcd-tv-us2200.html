<p class="P1">According to <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20070718PD204.html">DigiTimes</a>, Vizio will be introducing a 52" 1080p LCD TV in North America with a very aggressive price point of $2,200 in August. As with most of Vizio's LCDs, this 52" will have a IPS panel from LG.Philips LCD (LPL). The 52" 1080p Vizio will be available at Costco.</p></p>
<p class="P1">Amtran Technology, a Taiwan-based integrator, builds many Vizio LCD TVs. Amtran is also the second largest shareholder (~24%) of Vizio. Foxconn also builds for Vizio, the company's 26" offering. Amtran leaked info that Vizio is planning to introduce a 40" 1080p LCD TV by year's end using S-LCD's PVA panel. S-LCD is a joint venture between Sony and Samsung Electronics.</p></p>
<p class="P1">Is $2,200 for a 52" 1080p really the best price you can get? Well, for a LCD TV with an IPS panel, yes. If you don't mind a Sharp brand, have a look at the AQUOS LC-52D62U. This is also a 52" 1080p LCD TV and goes for about <a href="http://electronics.pricegrabber.com/plasma-lcd-televisions/m/26497892/search=52/sort_type=price">$2,150 using PriceGrabber</a>. If this is the case, I would like to see a much more aggressive price point of around $1,999 for Vizio's 52" 1080p offering. Of course, I prefer IPS over ASV (Advanced Super View, based on VA technology).</p></p>

$2200 might have been big news less than a year ago, but it isn't any more. Just checking my favorite online store, Amazon.com, shows me that $2200 has dropped to $1500, a decrease of $700 or 32% in just about 9 months!</p>
