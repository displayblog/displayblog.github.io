<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=chi-mei-optoelectronics">Chi Mei Optoelectronics</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=cmo">CMO</a>) has decided to throttle down LCD panel production by 10%, effective immediately. CMO's original plan was to wait until August to make a decision regarding LCD production. CMO has already decreased LCD module production by 10%. This is in response to inventory build up of LCDs and LCD-based products such as <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a>s and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-monitor">LCD monitor</a>s in the display supply chain.</p>
<p>IT customers have significantly reduced orders in July and at the same time LCD monitor panel prices have spiraled downward. Lowering LCD panel production by the second largest Taiwan-based LCD manufacturer will not have a major impact in the overall supply and demand situation, but will be a significant signal for others participating in the LCD supply chain. The overall utilization rate was reported by DigiTimes to be 90% after the 10% reduction. This is impossible as utilization rates are never at 100%. Most likely, CMO's realistic utilization after the 10% decrease would be around 80% to 83% is my guess.</p>
