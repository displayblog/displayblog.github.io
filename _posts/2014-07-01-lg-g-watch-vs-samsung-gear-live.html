<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/30/5856722/lg-g-watch-samsung-gear-live-review">David Pierce, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I prefer Samsung&acirc;&euro;&trade;s 1.63-inch AMOLED display, with its darker blacks and brighter whites, to LG&acirc;&euro;&trade;s slightly washed out 1.65-inch LCD. But since Samsung&acirc;&euro;&trade;s screen is slightly sharper (320 x 320 pixels instead of 280 x 280), all the touch targets are a little smaller and harder to tap. Using either one in bright sunlight is basically impossible [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>Google should standardize ppi on Google Gear devices for a consistent user interface, touch targets for example. And a watch not usable in bright sunlight? No thanks.</p>
