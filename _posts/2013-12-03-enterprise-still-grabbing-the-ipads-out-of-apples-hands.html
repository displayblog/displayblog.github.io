<blockquote><p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;While a more popular platform than iOS globally, [Android] is seeing very low adoption rates in the enterprise overall, particularly with tablets,&acirc;&euro; Blair said in a note to clients this week. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;We believe that most IT managers are avoiding the platform for large-scale rollouts and support due in large part to malware concerns.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://newsroom.juniper.net/press-releases/juniper-networks-finds-mobile-threats-continue-ram-nyse-jnpr-1029552">Juniper Networks Mobile Threat Center</a> (MTC), announced in June, 2013:</p>
<blockquote><p>Additionally, it is clear from developments in the threat landscape that malware writers are increasingly behaving like profit-motivated businesses when designing new attacks and malware distribution strategies. Attackers are maximizing their return on investment by focusing 92 percent of all MTC detected threats at Android, which has a commanding share of the global smartphone market.</blockquote></p>
<p>This is not to say iOS is immune as jailbroken iOS devices are just as susceptible to malware as Android, but it seems the target of choice for malware writers is Android.</p>
