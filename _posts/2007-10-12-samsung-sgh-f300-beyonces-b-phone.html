<p>Samsung reportedly slightly modified the SGH-F300 mobile phone to be more "Beyonc&Atilde;&copy; Like". I am not sure exactly what was done to the phone to make it more like Beyonce, but if you're interested in pictures of Beyonce and the B Phone together for a better comparison, hop on over to <a href="http://www.akihabaranews.com/en/news-14948-Here+comes+Samsung%27s+B-Phone%21.html">Akihabara News</a>. Of the many characteristics of Beyonce that make her so popular is her pretty face and well-endowed body (and of course her music-related talents). However, there aren't any curves to the B Phone, at all. Maybe it's more in the UI or the included music?</p>
