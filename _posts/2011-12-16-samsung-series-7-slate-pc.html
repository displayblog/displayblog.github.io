<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/12/16/samsung-series-7-slate-pc-review/">Dana Wollman, Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The tablet's expansive, 11.6-inch, PLS display has a 1366 x 768 pixel count, which we see all the time on small- to mid-sized laptops, but rarely on tablets. Indeed, it's crisp enough for comfortable web surfing and working with a few windows open. But mostly, the display shines on account on its vibrant, punchy colors. This is a 400-nit panel, making use of Samsung's SuperBright Plus technology -- just like the screen in the Series 9 laptop, except with a glossy, not matte, finish. As sunny as it is, though, we were hesitant to crank the brightness when using it outdoors, just because the battery life is so skimpy (spoiler!).</blockquote></p>
<p>A wonderful display with lots of brightness, but only for a little while. What good is a tablet if it lasts just 3 1/2 hours.</p>
