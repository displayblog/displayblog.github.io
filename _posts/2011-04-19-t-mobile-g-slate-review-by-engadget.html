<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/04/19/t-mobile-g-slate-review/">Tim Stevens</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The 8.9-inch, glossy, 1,280 x 768 display is a bit shorter and skinnier than the Xoom's 10.1-inch, 1,280 x 800 display. This gives it a slightly higher pixel density and, indeed, you can tell the difference. With the Xoom, the pitch on the pixels seemed a bit broad -- jagged edges appear on text and in high-contrast areas. The G-Slate's screen definitely has a sharper, crisper look. However, it's also rather more yellow, added warmth that we didn't notice until putting them side by side.</blockquote></p>
<p>The G Slate, also known as the Optimus Pad, sports a 15:9 aspect ratio display. Unique.</p>
