<p>LG Electronics (LGE) and Samsung sure seem to have absolutely no lack of names for their TVs. LGE's BoBos is an acronym for "the Best of Best on Style". Go figure. LGE does state that the XCanvas BoBos PDP TV won the 'Best of Innovation' award at CES 2008. LGE touts the frameless design, but actually, it is just a layer of glass on top of the PDP screen. Even in pictures you can see the bezel. The company claims that its BoBos line is the slimmest PDP TVs in the world at just 79.6mm (3.13"). I guess the depth is the same for either the 50" or 60" model. And one more thing: invisible speakers.</p>

<p>Contrast ratio of 30,000:1 was achieved by applying high-efficiency phosphors to make whites more white and blacks more black. The panel is called Super Bright Panel. A glass filter is used and has dual XD engines (LG's proprietary engine that improves video signals). The only let down is the fact that the pixel format is limited to just 1365 x 768. In this world where everything is going to Full HD (1920 x 1080), this seems to be just a cost-cutting measure.</p>
