<blockquote><p>Samsung Electronics reportedly has said it may start construction of its 7.5G panel plant in China as early as in May 2011 with mass production of panels likely to begin in early 2013. If the plan materializes, Samsung will be the first foreign firm to kick off construction of next-generation panel lines in China.</blockquote></p>
<p>China will soon be the largest market for LCDs, and on the way growth will be rapid. Samsung wants a piece of the action, a big piece.</p>
