<p>Vlad Savov, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/5/6109551/what-difference-does-a-sapphire-display-make-for-smartphones">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Huawei has taken the guts and design of its original Ascend P7, launched in May, and rebuilt them with more expensive stuff on the outside. The rear of device is now made of a "high-tech" ceramic that's three times stronger than steel, scratch-resistant, and fast to dissipate heat. The entire front, including the 5-inch 1080p screen and the bezels surrounding it, is covered by a sapphire crystal display. The aluminum frame that wraps around the top and sides of the P7 is retained, though it's rose-colored in this limited edition handset. Overall, this is a phone that aims for a glamorous look and achieves it with ease.</blockquote></p>
