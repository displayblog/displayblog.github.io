<p>Not really. HP's MediaSmart has a facial-tracking software that requires a certain level of foreground lighting. So light faces are easily detected while darker faces aren't. There's a video titled "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4DT3tQqgRM&amp;feature=player_embedded">HP computers are racist</a>" on YouTube showing how the MediaSmart prefers White Wanda to Black Desi when tracking faces. Funny but could be a PR nightmare for HP.&Acirc;&nbsp;Source: <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/12/hp-notebooks-racist/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+GearFactor+(Blog+-+Gadget+Lab+(Gear+Factor))&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">Wired</a></p>
