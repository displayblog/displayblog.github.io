<blockquote><p>It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s sad, really, that the state-of-the-art in the PC world is attempting to copy Apple. Why isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t Asus trying to blow the MacBook Air out of the water with something radically better?</p>
<p>I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t know how people who just copy others&acirc;&euro;&trade; work can take pride in what they do.</p>
<p>Maybe they don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t.</blockquote></p>
<p>True innovation takes considerable energy, constant attention, and time, lots of time. Copying takes only a tiny fraction.</p>
<p>Most of us take the path of less friction, and it seems that's where ASUS went with its Zenbook. The external <em>and</em> internal design of the Zenbook is eerily similar to the MacBook Air.</p>
<p>But maybe copying wasn't a choice for ASUS. Maybe copying was the only way for ASUS to be competitive against Apple.</p>
