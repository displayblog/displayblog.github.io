<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/12/10/iriver-e50-appears-charms-us-with-its-good-looks/">Engadget</a>: iriver is a Korea-based manufacturer of some incredible-looking gadgets. Take the company's e50 for instance. The e50 is a PMP (Portable Multimedia Player or Portable Media Player) with a nice external design: simple and elegant. But don't let that simplicity fool you.</p>
<p>Look closely and you can see direction buttons as well as a '-' and '+' clickable areas on that brushed aluminum bottom pad. Simple and functional, just like most of Apple's gears. The LCD is a 1.8" TFT LCD with a pixel format of 176x220 and generates 262K colors. The e50 sports a FM tuner, a microphone and plays MP3, OGG, FLAC, WMA, WAV audio files, SMV video files and displays JPEG, BMP, GIF image files. The price is right but let's hope it is as simple as connecting the e50 to your PC and managing your multimedia files via an app of your choice.</p>
