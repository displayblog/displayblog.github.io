<p>Sharp has developed a 3D touch LCD sporting using a parallax barrier system. That means you don't need 3D glasses. The CGS (Continuous Grain Silicon) based 3D LCD sports a brightness of 500 cd/m2, double that of typical 3D implementations. Thickness is about the same as conventional 2D displays. 3D works equally well in portrait and landscape modes. <a href="http://en.akihabaranews.com/42041/hands-on/hands-on-final-thought-of-sharps-3d-lcd-screen-summary?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Akihabaranews_en+%28AKIBA+EN%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">Akihabara News</a> seems to be fairly smitten with the 3D effects.</p>
