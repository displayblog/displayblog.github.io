<blockquote><p>Last week, I spent about an hour playing with a system called zSpace, a new display by Infinite Z that makes these sorts of Iron Man interactions a reality. And while I walked into the meeting a skeptic, I walked out realizing that these holographic interfaces aren&acirc;&euro;&trade;t just the future; if you have $6,000 to purchase your own, they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re today.</blockquote></p>
