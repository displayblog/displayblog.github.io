<blockquote><p>BOE Technology's (BOE) first 8.5G TFT LCD panel production line began trial operations in June 2011 and is expected to enter mass production in October. According to industry sources, BOE has been developing high-end products and may begin production of 3D TV panels using film patterned retarder (FPR) technology at the end of 2011 or beginning of 2012.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Gen 8.5 LCD fabrication plant is located in Beijing, China. The opening ceremony was held earlier this year on June 28. Initial input capacity in October is expected to be 15,000 glass substrates and may increase to 30,000 by the end of 2011. DigiTimes reports BOE's Gen 8.5 LCD fab is designed for a maximum monthly input capacity of 90,000 substrates, but other media sources cite BOE president Chen Yanshun stating full production capacity at 120,000 glass substrates per month. BOE expects to reach full capacity in the second quarter of 2012. </p>
<p>FPR, a LG Display developed passive 3D technology that handily beat out active shutter in <a href="/2011/09/07/3d-fpr-vs-active-shutter/">a recent test conducted by DisplayMate's Dr. Raymond Soneira</a>, will be BOE's choice of 3D technology. BOE is expected to manufacture FPR 3D LCD panels in three sizes, in inches: 32, 46, and 55.</p>
<p>China-based consumer electronics manufacturers Changhong, Hisense, Konka, and Skyworth Digital Holdings have signed a memorandum of intent with BOE to engage in joint research and development efforts for LCD TVs. These are also the same companies that have agreed to jointly promote FPR 3D LCD technology with LG Display.</p>
