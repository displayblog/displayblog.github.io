<p><a href="http://lgdnewsroom.com/press_releases/2806">LG Display</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>LG Display&acirc;&euro;&trade;s flexible OLED panel is built on plastic substrates instead of glass. By applying film-type encapsulation technology and attaching the protection film to the back of the panel, LG Display made the panel bendable and unbreakable. The new display is vertically concave from top to bottom with a radius of 700mm, opening up a world of design innovations in the smartphone market.</blockquote></p>
<p>An unbreakable smartphone display? Can't wait.</p>
