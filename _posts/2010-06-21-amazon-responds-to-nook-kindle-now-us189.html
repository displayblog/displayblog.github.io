<p>Barnes &amp; Noble came out with a WiFi-only NOOK for $149 and dropped the 3G-capable NOOK from $259 to $199. I mentioned in <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/21/wifi-nook-149-3g-nook-price-drops-to-199/">WiFi NOOK: $149, 3G NOOK Price Drops to $199</a></em> that I look forward to more affordable e-book readers soon, but this is quick: Amazon has responded by slashing the price of the Kindle from $259 to $189 bringing it $10 under the 3G NOOK (affiliate link to Amazon's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015T963C?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=displ0f-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0015T963C">Kindle</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=displ0f-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0015T963C" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> page). Will Amazon introduce a WiFi-only Kindle? Probably not since it doesn't have a brick-and-mortar presence like Barnes &amp; Noble where a WiFi-ony device could be used to view and purchase books, magazines, etc.</p>
<p>Everyday the cost of manufacturing one of these E Ink-based e-book readers is forced down and eventually we will get to $99 and at that point e-book readers based on E Ink technology will become widespread and will cease to be a tool loved only by avid readers. At that point, I can imagine those who already have iPads getting an e-book reader, which will become synonymous with the book you carry to read on the subway, bus or plane. The iPad will eventually replace the netbook but E Ink e-book readers will eventually replace the book.</p>
