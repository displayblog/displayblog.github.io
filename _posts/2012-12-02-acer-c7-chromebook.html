<p>Andrew Cunningham, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/12/review-acers-c7-chromebook-is-199-and-feelin-fine-relatively/">Ars Technica</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The laptop's biggest sticking point is probably the display, an 11.6-inch 1366x768 number. The color and brightness are actually pretty good. However, as is common in the low-quality TN displays used in low-end laptops, the contrast ratio is bad and the viewing angles are worse. With an 11-inch display you should usually have the room to open the screen as much as you need even if you're on a train or plane. In the case of the C7, this is lucky because looking at the screen from anything other than the optimal angle completely washes it out in a hurry. A stuck pixel on our Google-provided review unit may also be indicative of less-than-perfect quality control on Acer's part, though this is difficult to ascertain from using only one machine.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Acer C7 Chromebook is priced at US$199.</p>
