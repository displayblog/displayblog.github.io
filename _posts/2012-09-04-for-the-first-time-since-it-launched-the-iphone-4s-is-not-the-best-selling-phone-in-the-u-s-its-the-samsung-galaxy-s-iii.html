<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-samsung-galaxy-s3-outsold-the-iphone-4s-in-august-2012-9#ixzz25VhrY1R2">Jay Yarow, Business Insider</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Samsung's Galaxy S III outsold the iPhone 4S in the U.S. in August, according to channel checks from Michael Walkley at Canaccord Genuity.</blockquote></p>
<p>We should assume Canaccord has access to all retail channel point of sale (POS) information in the U.S.?  Canaccord's Genuity monthly channel checks shows the top three ranking smartphones at AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile: (Note: T-Mobile doesn't sell iPhones.)</p>
<ul>
<li>AT&T: #1 Apple iPhone 4S, #2 Samsung Galaxy S III, #3 HTC One X</li>
<li>Verizon: #1 Samsung Galaxy S III, #2 Motorola RAZR MAXX, #3 Apple iPhone 4S</li>
<li>Sprint: #1 Samsung Galaxy S III, #2 Apple iPhone 4S, #3 HTC EVO 4G LTE</li>
<li>T-Mobile: #1 Samsung Galaxy S III, #2 HTC One S, #3 Samsung Galaxy S II</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>So you have the rankings. In order to know for sure who is on top you need actual sales. I think all of us know that. But does Canaccord have access to POS data at Best Buy, RadioShack, Walmart, and thousands of resellers throughout the U.S.? I'm fairly sure it does not. These rankings by Canaccord mean very little. And for Yarow to have jumped the gun declaring to the world the iPhone 4S is no longer number one in the U.S. is, to say the least, premature.</p>
<p>I do think iPhone 4S sales are probably at its lowest point since going on sale; the next iPhone is expected to be announced soon: September 12 is the rumored date (<a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/09/apple-confirms-september-12-event-its-almost-here/">now confirmed</a>). Most of us in the market for an iPhone are waiting for the new one.</p>
<p>Combine low iPhone 4S sales and strong demand for the Samsung Galaxy S III and the environment is ripe for articles like this one from Business Insider. The Samsung Galaxy S III looks quite nice and shifts away from merely copying the iPhone toward taking inspiration from it and transforming it into something uniquely Samsung. From a company that's been legally proven to have copied the iPhone the latest Galaxy S III looks like it derived a lot of design inspiration from outside of Cupertino, California.
