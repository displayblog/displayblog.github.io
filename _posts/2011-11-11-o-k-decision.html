<p>Former Google executive on Larry Page <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/10/technology/googles-chief-works-to-trim-a-bloated-ship.html">The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s much more of a style like Steve Jobs than the three-headed monster that Google was. When Eric was there, you&acirc;&euro;&trade;d walk into a product meeting or a senior staff meeting, and everyone got to weigh in on every decision. Larry is much more willing to make an O.K. decision and make it now, rather than a perfect decision later.</blockquote></p>
<p>What I've gleaned from reading several books on Steve Jobs: His style was an unwillingness to compromise perfection, now and later.</p>
