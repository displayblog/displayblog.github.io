<p><a href="http://www.displaymate.com/news.html#3">Ray Soneira on the LG 55-inch OLED TV at SID 2012</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The LG 3D OLED TV with its running demo was absolutely stunning - visually it was the most impressive TV I have ever seen.</blockquote></p>
<p>On the Samsung 55-inch OLED TV:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Samsung 3D OLED TV with its running demo was very nice but definitely not in the stunning category like the LG 3D OLED TV in my opinion. The running demo was mediocre and that might be the source of the problem.</blockquote></p>
<p>LG uses an <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/11/23/sharp-igzo-based-ipad-3-retina-display/">IGZO</a> backplane while Samsung uses LTPS.</p>
