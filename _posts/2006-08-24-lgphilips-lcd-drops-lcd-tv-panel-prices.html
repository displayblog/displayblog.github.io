<p>Contrary to what AU Optronics (AUO) and Chi Mei Optoelectronics (CMO) is planning to do with 32" LCD TV prices, LG.Philips LCD (LPL) will lower prices on its 32", 37" and 42" panels. This is great news! Not only will you be able to get cheaper prices on LCD TVs that have LPL's 32", 37" and 42" panels, you'll be getting one of the best LCDs on the market--LPL uses Super In-Plane Switching (Super IPS) wide viewing angle technology that folks like Apple has been using for a long time. With Apple having to satisfy graphics designers and those that require the best color fidelity, it's a testimony to LPL's S-IPS technology. I for one will be getting a LCD TV with S-IPS. I wouldn't call it crap, but panels using Patterned Vertical Alignment (PVA) or Multi-domain Vertical Alignment (MVA) or even Advanced Super View (ASV) isn't up to par with S-IPS. IMHO. Oh yes, the prices:</p>
<p>32": US$330-$350<br />
37": US$530-$560<br />
42": US$710-$730</p>
<p>These prices would translate into set prices of around:</p>
<p>32": US$990-$1050<br />
37": US$1590-$1680<br />
42": US$2130-$2190</p>
<p>Of course, we've already seen prices for 42" LCD TVs drop to under $2000 at CostCo and other clubs, that work with less margins than Best Buy or Circuit City. If LPL's panels are used for LCD TV sets that will be at CostCo, plan on sub-$2000 prices.</p>
