<p>Viewsonic announced that its LCD monitors that shipped since December have been Vista certified. Viewsonic's Vista certification applies to the new VA-series, VG-series, VP-series and VX-series LCD monitors. Chi Mei has applied for Windows Vista Premium certification will be acquiring Vista certification sometime next week. Chi Mei stated that Vista will help stimulate demand for wide LCD monitors. Microsoft's new Vista operating system (OS) will certainly aid in selling wide LCD monitors, but I don't think it will be the main reason. Wide LCD monitors have been selling well and quite a bit prior to Vista's introduction. I think they have gotten it all wrong: strong sales in wide LCD monitors will stimulate the Vista adoption. That's if Vista really does make use of high resolution graphics in wide format.</p>
