<p>According to the Chinese-language Economic Daily News and reported by <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20100203PB201.html">DIGITIMES</a>, Taiwan-based Radiant Opto-Electronics will be supplying 300,000 LED backlight units (BLUs) to be integrated into the LCD used in Apple's iPad. If this report is correct, Radiant is building the LED BLUs for integration into the IPS LCD panels from LG Display. It isn't known if Radiant is the only LED BLU supplier but 300,000 units sound conservative: there are likely additional LED BLU suppliers.</p>
