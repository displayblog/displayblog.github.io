<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/31/amazons-new-dash-button-hardware-offers-instant-orders-for-staple-products/">Darrell Etherington, TechCrunch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Amazon has new hardware called the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/oc/dash-button">Dash Button</a> that allows one-press ordering of products you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re likely to want to replace on a regular basis. The Dash Button comes in a number of different branded versions based on what it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s coded to order, and includes an adhesive backing and hook holster to let you stick it where it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s most convenient.</blockquote></p>
<p>In the TechCrunch article, there's a photo of a Tide Dash Button stuck to a washing machine. I can only imagine what little kids will do with that button: "Honey, why did you order <em>30 boxes</em> of Tide?!?"</p>
