<p>Guest author <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/08/13/review-leica-m9/">Rich Svinkin reviews the Leica M9</a> on CrunchGear:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Leica M9 is deserving of its accolades and undoubtedly will earn its place in history. But be careful, if you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve got seven or so thousand dollars to spend understand that you are getting a great camera for shooting portraits and scenes, a unique aesthetic quality in the visual imagery that only comes with a Leica lens, and a great conversation starter.</blockquote></p>
<p>MSRP is US$8000...</p>
