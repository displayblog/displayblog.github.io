<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/12/23/apple-special-event-on-january-26-2010/">Originally the date was rumored to be the 26th of January for an Apple event</a>. According to John Paczkowski at All Things D, Apple's event will be on the 27th instead, on a Wednesday. Nobody really knows what Apple will be announcing but there is a good chance that it will be a multitouch tablet of sorts. Mac4Ever is reporting that developers have been given an iPhone OS 4 beta SDK with a simulator that allows for reformatting apps for a new screen size and resolution. The Wall Street Journal is also postulating that this yet-to-be-announced tablet will be shipping in March.
