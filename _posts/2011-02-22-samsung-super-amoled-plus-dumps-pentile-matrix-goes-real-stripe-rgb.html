<p><a href="http://www.oled-info.com/super-amoled-plus-resolution-explained">OLED-Info</a>: On the left is an "Ordinary AMOLED Display" and on the right is a "Super AMOLED Plus". It's funny that Samsung is hating on its own. Not long ago the very best that Samsung had to offer was the Super AMOLED display (on the left) that went into all the different variations of its bestseller the Galaxy S smartphone. Super AMOLED marketing was everywhere. Now, it's been relegated to just an ordinary AMOLED display.</p>
<p>The ordinary AMOLED display that Samsung is referring to isn't ordinary at all. It used a smart sub-pixel structure and software algorithm to overcome some of OLED's limitations while allowing for very good resolution, comparable to high-end LCDs.</p>
<p>If you look closely you can see the PenTile Matrix sub-pixel structure had large reds and blues. I don't know about the reds, but the blues were big for a very important reason. Blue OLEDs are not as efficient as the red or green. What that means is that the blue OLEDs need to be driven harder to generate enough blue light. The problem with that is that OLEDs experience accelerated aging, or brightness declines.</p>
<p>The brilliant folks at Nouvoyance (formerly Clairvoyante) solved the problem of differential aging by making the blue OLEDs larger and combining the unique sub-pixel structure with some nifty software algorithms. The PenTile Matrix sub-pixel layout allowed Samsung to boast of its Super AMOLED display and sell a bunch of Galaxy S phones and its derivatives. Now the battle-tested technology is shunned as merely ordinary for the new kid on the block.</p>
<p>There was one little catch though. Compared to the very best, like the IPS LCD in the original Droid, text wasn't as clear on the PenTile Matrix-based Super AMOLED display. Now Samsung has rectified the situation with its new Super AMOLED Plus. This new OLED display uses the typical RGB (Red Green Blue) sub-pixel structure, called Real-Stripe, that you find in almost all LCDs. As you can see in the image above, Real-Stripe results in a higher resolution, providing better details in both images and texts. That's nice, and solves the problem of resolution. But then you get back to the original problem of differential aging due to the less efficient blue OLED.</p>
<p>So, did Samsung improve the efficiency of blue OLEDs? Or is Samsung betting that you'll never get to experience this particular problem since you'll be upgrading to new versions every year or two? I'll keep you posted.</p>
