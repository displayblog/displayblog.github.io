<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-30/blackberry-ceo-questions-future-of-tablets.html">Bloomberg</a>: BlackBerry CEO Thorsten Heins:</p>
<blockquote><p>In five years I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t think there&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll be a reason to have a tablet anymore. Maybe a big screen in your workspace, but not a tablet as such. Tablets themselves are not a good business model.</blockquote></p>
<p>Not for BlackBerry anyway.</p>
