<p>Notebook PC manufacturers are expecting the second quarter to be sequentially flat despite a seasonally weak quarter. One reason maybe the recent introduction of new models by brands such as Acer and Lenovo with HP expected to announce new models soon. These new models should offset some concerns regarding the build-up of notebook PC panel inventories.</p>
<p>Acer recently launched its TimelineX line of ultrathin notebook PCs and Lenovo its Thinkpad Edge. The TimelineX and the ThinkPad Edge lines are positioned to be bestsellers in the second quarter, the same time HP is slated to introduce new Pavilion notebook PCs. HP's enterprise models will start shipping in late March with volume shipments to begin in the second quarter.</p>

Acer's TimelineX 1830T sports a 11.6-inch LCD with a 1366x768 pixel format and is the company's first Calpella-based ultraportable notebook PCs. The Core i5-520UM runs at 1.06GHz and can be increased to 1.86GHz with Turbo Boost. Other specs include: Intel HM55 graphics, HDMI, Gigabit Ethernet, WiFi BGN, Bluetooth 2.1+EDR (optional), 3G (optional), multi-format card reader, USB (3), and eight-hour 6-cell battery.

Lenovo's ThinkPad Edge line of notebooks include three sizes: 13.3-inch, 14.0-inch and 15.6-inch, all using LED backlights. Other specs include: dual-core CPUs from Intel and AMD, multitouch trackpad, spill-resistant keyboard, built-in DVD (14.0-inch, 15.6-inch), integrated or discrete graphics, EPEAT Gold rating. The 13-inch Edge with an AMD CPU starts at US$579 ($799 for Intel). Both the 14.0-inch and 15.6-inch models sport only Intel CPUs and both start at $649.

<p>Quanta Computer, a major notebook PC integrator, expects a 20% sequential growth in the second quarter. The company points to the strengths of 15.6-inch and larger HP notebook PCs and 14-inch to 15-inch ultrathin notebook PCs from Acer. Wistron, another notebook PC integrator, expects to benefit from Acer and Lenovo and post a 5-10% sequential growth in unit volume. Inventec also sees 10% sequential growth thanks to HP's enterprise notebooks. Shipments by Compal are expected to be flat or post a 5% increase.
