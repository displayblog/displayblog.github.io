<p>[ <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/11/3/9662790/lg-v10-review-android-phone-specs-camera">The Verge</a> ] Vlad Savov:</p>
<blockquote><p>The real attraction of the LG V10 is the camera that resides above the button cluster, so let&rsquo;s get right to it. It&rsquo;s <em>amazing</em>. I&rsquo;m taking more photos and being more creative than I have with any other phone. Where other smartphones will render an indistinct blob of bright red, the V10 captures a beautiful, finely detailed&nbsp;<a href="https://flic.kr/p/zEBpHy">flower in bloom</a>. I see each petal distinguished from the next, with proper color gradation from the subtle pink hues to the deeper reds. At night, I&rsquo;m unafraid to pull out the V10 and capture a particularly atmospheric scene &mdash; such as this tree illuminated by street lights behind it &mdash; knowing that this phone&rsquo;s camera can handle it.</blockquote><br />
LG got the camera spot on. The 2560x1440 5.7-inch display? Excellent. The 2.1-inch secondary on top? Get rid of it.</p>
