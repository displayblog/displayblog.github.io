<p>Samsung's double-sided mobile LCD is a 2.2" display with a 240 x 320 pixel format. This unique LCD can display two different sets of information simultaneously on the front and back. Samsung uses a double-gate TFT design that control both sides: one transmissive and the other reflective LCD. The LCD is slightly thicker at 2.6mm, has 265K color capability, and gives you a brightness of 250 cd/m2 on the transmissive LCD and 100 cd/m2 on the reflective LCD.</p>

<p>I wonder what having two LCDs will do to battery lifetimes... probably drop it by 25-40%. This is definitely an interesting development in LCD technology, but unfortunately, I would give it poor marks for marketability as battery technology is currently unable to support it on a mobile phone platform. Imagine dropping $500 for a super smartphone with a 45 minute talk-time and 5 hours of standby time. Horror.</p>
