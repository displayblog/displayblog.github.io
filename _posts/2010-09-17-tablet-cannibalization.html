<p>NPD reported US retail notebook unit sales declined 4% Y/Y in August, a first decline. The first week of September shows a similar 4% Y/Y drop. Best Buy's CEO Brian Dunn remarked the iPad cannibalized notebook PC sales by as much as 50%.</p>
<p>What's going on? Tablet cannibalization. But in a particular way. Here's John Gruber on <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/09/17/huberty">Daring Fireball</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&acirc;&euro;&trade;s been no sign that Mac laptop sales have slowed. We only have one quarter of results for the iPad era, but Mac sales were up 33 percent year-over-year. If it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s true that &acirc;&euro;&oelig;laptop&acirc;&euro;¬ù sales overall are slowing, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s coming entirely at the expense of Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s competitors. My theory is that it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s simply about price points. Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s MacBooks start at $999. The iPad isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t competing against MacBooks &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s competing against $500-900 computers.</blockquote></p>
<p>I remember the slide Steve Jobs put up when he unveiled the iPad. Right between the smartphone and the notebook PC was where he pegged the iPad, as a netbook competitor. And it seems that's exactly what's happening.</p>
