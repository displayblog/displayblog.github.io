<p><a href="http://www.asymco.com/2012/07/04/the-building-and-dismantling-of-the-windows-advantage/">Horace Dediu</a> explains the building and dismantling of the Windows monopoly on operating systems. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/07/04/windows-hegemony">John Gruber</a> sums it up nicely:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bottom line: In 1984, DOS PCs outsold the Mac 6-to-1. By 2004, the ratio of Windows PCs to Macs sold peaked at 56-to-1. Today it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s under 20-to-1 and still dropping &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; but if you include iOS devices, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s down to 2-to-1. Staggering.</blockquote></p>
<p>And Dediu expects parity in at most two years.</p>
