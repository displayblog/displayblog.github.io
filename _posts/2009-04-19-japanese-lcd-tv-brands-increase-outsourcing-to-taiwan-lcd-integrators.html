<p>Patrick Chan, <a href="http://mic.iii.org.tw/english/">MIC</a> industry analyst, stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Aiming to avoid risks stemming from currency exchange rates and in-house production, Japanese vendors have begun increasing their orders outsourced to Taiwanese makers. In China, <a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3Autpr0mvi0e9&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=lcd+tv&amp;sa=Search">LCD TV</a>s have entered third- and fourth-tier cities in China, which are developing the Chinese market through contract production or own brands, could see shipment increases. In the second quarter of 2009, Taiwanese LCD TV shipment volume is expected to grow 13.4 percent sequentially to 4.60 million units.</blockquote><br />
This is good news for the LCD industry and thanks to China, demand for LCD TVs should continue to increase for the time being.</p>
