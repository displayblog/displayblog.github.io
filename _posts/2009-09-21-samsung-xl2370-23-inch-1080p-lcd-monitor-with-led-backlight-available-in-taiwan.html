<p><strong>Lucky Taiwan</strong> Samsung's XL2370 is a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=23-inch+1080p+lcd+monitor&amp;sa=Search">23-inch 1080p LCD monitor</a> but with a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=led+backlight&amp;sa=Search">LED backlight</a>. The company introduced the XL2370 in Taiwan. More LCD monitors with LED backlights from 19- to 27-inch in size are expected to be hitting the market in 2010.</p>
<p><strong>White &amp; Edge</strong> The LED backlight makes use of white LEDs and are edge-lit. A 5,000,000:1 dynamic contrast is stated but that is nonsense. The 2ms response time is very fast. The retail price of the XL2370 is NT$13,990 (about US$430). Market sources expect LCD monitors with LED backlights to capture just 10% of the entire LCD market due to their higher prices. Speaking of higher prices, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/10/14/apple-24-led-cinema-display/">Apple's LED Cinema Display</a> is US$899. Samsung's XL2370 undercuts the expensive Apple monitor by a significant amount and prices should continue to decrease.</p>
<p><strong>"LED Monitor"</strong> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/06/23/led-tv/">Samsung has made a big mess out of its "LED TV" marketing</a> implying that its LED TV is different from that of a LCD TV. The only thing different is the use of a different light source: CCFL versus LED. The same goes for this new LCD monitor. I have a feeling that Samsung will further confuse the market by marketing this new LCD monitor with LED backlight technology as a "LED monitor". Let's not be fooled.</p>
