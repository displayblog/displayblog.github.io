<p><a href="http://www.newswire.co.kr/newsRead.php?no=636046">Newsire</a> (Korean): The Samsung UN75ES9000F is a 75-inch LCD TV with a Super Ultra Slim Design, which means a very thin bezel of just 0.3 inches. The 75-inch Diamond Black LCD sports a 30% improvement in contrast and a 60% improvement in brightness. Relative performance gains without actual specifications don't mean much to me, but unfortunately I can't seem to find the specs. With all those icons the TV looks less like a TV and more like a huge tablet. Priced at &#8361;19,800,000 or about US$17,400.</p>
