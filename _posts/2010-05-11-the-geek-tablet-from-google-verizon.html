<p>Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam confirmed that the company is working with Google on an tablet. And Marquett Smith, Verizon's VP of Corporate Communications, added that it would be an Android OS-based tablet. If the simply-designed closed iPad is for the masses, I'm guessing the Geek Tablet from Google and Verizon will be for geeks: quite open, meaning hackable, with lots of ports and buttons (at least four on the front face). I hope hardware design is left to companies like HTC so we can look forward to beautiful Android tablets in the near future. I'm also guessing these companies will make sure Flash works very well. In terms of pricing, it will probably be subsidized by Verizon with a $30 unlimited data plan.
