<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/10/nook-color-announcement/">Wired</a>: Tim Carmody on the Barnes & Noble Nook Color:</p>
<blockquote><p>But this e-reader gives Google&acirc;&euro;&trade;s OS a bit more of a workout, ditching the low-power, monochrome E Ink display and the two-screen interface of the original Nook.</p>
<p>Instead, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s got a 7-inch color LCD touchscreen made by LG. The screen technology is called &acirc;&euro;&oelig;VividView&acirc;&euro;¬ù and incorporates an anti-glare coating, but is otherwise far closer to a tablet display than an e-book reader like the Kindle.</blockquote></p>
<p>I would think having  two displays would be more taxing on the system. The Nook Color is basically a neutered tablet.</p>
