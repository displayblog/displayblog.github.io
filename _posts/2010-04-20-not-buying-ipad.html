<p>mnmlist in <em><a href="http://mnmlist.com/ipad/">why i won't be buying an ipad</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Because I don't need one.</blockquote><br />
He points to the two-year-old brilliantly-working iMac and MacBook Air that take care of all of his computing needs, and probably for another two to three years. The interesting thing is that I checked out the iPad <em>precisely</em> because I wanted to simplify my life and minimize the number of gadgets. I thought I could eventually get rid of my MacBook Pro, mobile phone, books, scheduler, notepad, etc. I wanted to investigate whether or not the iPad could replace everything. Unfortunately, after just a couple of weeks I discovered the iPad is good for just a few things, as of now. One of the things the iPad isn't good for is blogging, which I need to do, efficiently, each and every day.</p>
