<p><strong><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/12/12/debranded-refurbished-hp-w2408h-24-lcd-monitor-for-19999-at-buycom/">TS Series Display TS-24W8h Specifications</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-3445 aligncenter" title="ts_24w8h_01" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/ts_24w8h_01.jpg" alt="ts_24w8h_01" width="480"  /><em>An ordinary box. Not pretty. Not ugly.</em></p></p>
<p>I took delivery of my TS-24W8h or a debranded and recertified HP w2408h. It is a 24" LCD monitor with a 1920 x 1200 pixel format. The TS-24W8h looks exactly like the HP's w2408h but with a few differences. Before we get into the differences I was a little let down when I first opened up the box: the base of the monitor did not have any padding and my first thought was, "I hope the shock or vibration didn't break the thing." Thankfully it didn't break or have any defects.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-3446 aligncenter" title="ts_24w8h_02" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/ts_24w8h_02.jpg" alt="ts_24w8h_02" width="480"  /><em>I was worried because the base did not have any cushion.</em></p></p>
<p>Back to the differences. First of all, the TS-24W8h actually has a brand: TS Series Display. Upon opening I spotted a sticker of a globe in the position where the silver HP logo is on my branded w2408h monitors. Then there is a sticker that says "SVGA Monitor". I don't like using these cryptic acroynms but SVGA stands for Super Video Graphics Array that supports 800 x 600 pixels. The TS-24W8h does way more than that, try 1920 x 1200. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-3448 aligncenter" title="ts_24w8h_04" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/ts_24w8h_04.jpg" alt="ts_24w8h_04" width="480"  /><em>Looks exactly like an HP w2408h, as expected.</em></p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-3449 aligncenter" title="ts_24w8h_05" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/ts_24w8h_05.jpg" alt="ts_24w8h_05" width="480"  /><em>It's an interesting logo: a globe.</em></p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-3450 aligncenter" title="ts_24w8h_06" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/ts_24w8h_06.jpg" alt="ts_24w8h_06" width="480"  /><em>SVGA Color Display? Nope. The native pixel format is 1920 x 1200.</em></p></p>
<p>There are other notable differences: on the TS-24W8h the two icons on top of the '-' and '+' buttons aren't there. The text 'Auto' on top of the 'Select' button isn't there either. The ambient sensor on the TS-24W8h has a white ring while the w2408h is just black. There was one more difference that was a bit more difficult to spot. The black bezel on the TS-24W8h looked slightly less black next to the w2408h. These are all minor differences that do not make much of a difference on how the monitor performs.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-3454 aligncenter" title="ts_24w8h_10" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/ts_24w8h_10.jpg" alt="ts_24w8h_10" width="480"  /><em>No icons or text above the bottons for the TS-24W8h.</em></p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-3455 aligncenter" title="ts_24w8h_11" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/ts_24w8h_11.jpg" alt="ts_24w8h_11" width="480"  /><em>Icons and text for the HP w2408h.</em></p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-3452 aligncenter" title="ts_24w8h_08" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/ts_24w8h_08.jpg" alt="ts_24w8h_08" width="480"  /><em>White outline on the ambient light sensor for the TS-24W8h.</em></p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-3453 aligncenter" title="ts_24w8h_09" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/ts_24w8h_09.jpg" alt="ts_24w8h_09" width="480"  /><em>Not so on the w2408h.</em></p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-3451 aligncenter" title="ts_24w8h_07" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/ts_24w8h_07.jpg" alt="ts_24w8h_07" width="480"  /><em>It is hard to tell but the TS-24W8h on the left has a slightly less black border than the w2408h on the right.</em></p></p>
<p>I can tell you the TS-24W8h performances just as well as the w2408h. I paid $199.99 plux tax (since I live in California) and is probably the best deal around for a 24" LCD monitor. I do hope for my sake that this doesn't require any service because if I do, I'll need to call a special number: 866-447-6872. I got it hooked up to my Mac mini, matched up the pixel format and it looks beautiful!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-3456 aligncenter" title="ts_24w8h_12" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/ts_24w8h_12.jpg" alt="ts_24w8h_12" width="480"  /><em>The TS-24W8h connected to my trusty little Mac mini. Yes, the mouse is ugly but it works and has been for many years. :-)</em></p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><img class="size-full wp-image-3457 aligncenter" title="ts_24w8h_13" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/ts_24w8h_13.jpg" alt="ts_24w8h_13" width="480"  /></em></p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>It's hard to tell the difference between the TS-24W8h (top) vs. the w2408h (bottom) in these pictures.<br />
I couldn't tell them apart by just looking at the display; I'm assuming they are using the same LCD panels.<br />
</em></p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><img class="size-full wp-image-3458 aligncenter" title="ts_24w8h_14" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/ts_24w8h_14.jpg" alt="ts_24w8h_14" width="480"  /><br />
</em><br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When compared to the HP w2408h side-by-side I couldn't tell any difference between the two in terms of picture quality. I hope you enjoyed getting to know this weird unbranded (but branded) recertified 24" LCD monitor. I'll say it again: <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/12/12/debranded-refurbished-hp-w2408h-24-lcd-monitor-for-19999-at-buycom/">it is one of the best buys out there</a> if you're okay with a nonbranded recertified model. The tilt, height and pivot adjustments are an added bonus to an already robust LCD monitor.</p></p>
