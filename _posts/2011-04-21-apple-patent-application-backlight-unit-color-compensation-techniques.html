<p><a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/21/apple_investigating_improved_led_backlights_with_more_accurate_colors.html">AppleInsider</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple's solution would address the issues associated with edge-lit backlights for LCD displays by utilizing a "light guide" Coupled with a "light-extracting surface area," it could compensate for color shift issues found with current edge-lit displays, like those found in Apple's MacBook Pro notebooks.</blockquote></p>
<p>The problem: phosphor-coated white LED light has a blue-ish tint in short distances and turns yellow-ish the longer it travels. This variation affects color uniformity on a LCD using a white LED-based backlight unit. This patent thoroughly mixes the light to make sure light hitting the color filter is uniform in color.</p>
