<p>Sony's KDS-R60XBR2 is a 60" rear projection TV (RPTV) based on LCoS technology, Sony's SXRD. One feature that is dramatically different from the XBR1 version is the ability to display 1080p, thanks to its 1920 x 1080 pixel format, and the ability to accept 1080p connections from Blu-ray players. I did a quick check (2006.01.02 around 11pm PST) on <a href="http://www.shopzilla.com/12--Sony_Grand_WEGA_KDS_R60XBR2_60_in_Rear_Projection_TV_-_cat_id--11520000__keyword--kds%20r60xbr2__prod_id--494364574__sort--7">Shopzilla</a> and found a $2735.00 shipped price from a Customer Certified store, Abe's Of Maine. If you want the convenience of being able to take it back to a store, you'll need to pay $3970.81 at Circuit City. The sub-$3000 price is a great price for a 60" LCoS TV!</p>

<p>The KDS-R60XBR2 uses three LCoS chips for each primary color: R, G, B. Each of the three chips have 1920 x 1080 pixel formats. There are three HDMI inputs, CableCARD, TV Guide on Screen, and a PC input that supports up to 1920 x 1080 at 60Hz. The UHP lamp is rated at 180w and will cost $300 to replace after about 7-8 years of normal use. ATSC and NTSC tuners are built-in as are other inputs such as componsite, etc.</p>
<p>The KDS-R60XBR2 would be the TV that I would get if I had the money. The LCoS 3-chip design allows for great color fidelity. The color wheel design of DLP units bug me for some reason. Of course, LED backlit DLP units should solve the problem and get rid of the color wheel once and for good. Maybe at the end of 2007, a KDS-R60XBR3 (an upgraded version with even better color or with a LED backlight?) can be had for sub-$2000 at a retail store like Cicruit City.</p>
