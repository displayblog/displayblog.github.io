<blockquote><p>Okay, so it's not exactly great for pixel density, but that doesn't mean we're not seriously impressed with the anti-glare matte display. Yes, that means there's no glossiness or reflections, and yes, it's great! We actually were able to work on the laptop on a sunny day without putting up any sort of shade. Too boot, the display is quite bright and the viewing angles are rather decent -- we had no problem sharing the screen in a tight airplane seat with our neighbor. We do have one complaint though -- the screen bezel is certainly glossy and can pick up its fair share of fingerprints.</blockquote></p>
<p>The unique 12.5-inch LCD sports a 1366x768 pixel format. Some brilliant chap thought to make use of a matte display but then had a brain fart and left the bezel glossy.</p>
