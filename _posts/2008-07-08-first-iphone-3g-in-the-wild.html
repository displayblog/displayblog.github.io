<p>iPhonePortugal has the first <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=iphone-3g">iPhone 3G</a>. Upon looking carefully at the innards, it looks like the new slim power adapter is not included, probably because of the higher power requirements (220W). I am not planning to upgrade my iPhone, but I wouldn't mind purchasing the tiny power adapter for travel purposes.</p>

<p>An evolutionary step toward making the iPhone 3G customer even more happy would be to develop and include an <em>in-ear</em> stereo headset with mic. The regular for-iPod in-ear stereo headset is quite an improvement over the regular one. So I could imagine how much better listening and talking on an in-ear stereo headset with mic might be!</p>
