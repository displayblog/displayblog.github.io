<p><a href="http://gizmodo.com/5075655/fujitsu-lifebook-n7010-equipped-with-integrated-touchscreen-app-launcher">Gizmodo</a>: The Fujitsu Lifebook N7010 is a very unique notebook PC. The N7010 not only has a 16" wide TFT LCD for its main display but also has a small 4" wide LCD on top of the keyboard. The little LCD has a pixel format of 480x272 and is used as an application launcher, a second monitor, a CD/DVD control panel or a photo viewer. This feature is touted as an industry first for notebook PCs. Some of you might be scratching your head saying, "Wait, wasn't there something like this... that Windows Vista Sideshow thingy?"</p>

<p>Well, yes there was such a thing but Fujitsu's secondary display has no connections to it. You see, the 4" LCD isn't simply used for email notifications, time or date or any of that nonsense (you have your smartphone, don't you?) that the Sideshow displays were usually limited to doing. This little LCD can be used just like if you had another display attached to the N7010. Very cool. Now let's get to the next step and make the entire keyboard a display! Of course, you'll need to use a combination of visual, sensory, and audio feedback to make a LCD keyboard work. But imagine the possibilities: international keyboards with just a "touch of a button", Nintendo DS-like game play, rotate it to make the entire notebook PC a gigantic LCD and much much more!</p>
