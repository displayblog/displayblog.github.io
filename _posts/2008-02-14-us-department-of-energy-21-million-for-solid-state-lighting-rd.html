<p>On February 13, 2008, the US Department of Energy (DOE) announced that it would invest almost $21 million in 13 projects to advance solid-state lighting (SSL). The DOE realizes that lighting system efficiency can be doubled and carbon footprint reduced by using SSL technology instead of incandescent and fluorescent technologies. SSL uses a semiconductor that converts electricity into light and include light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).</p>
<p>
The 13 projects include Add-Vision Inc. (P-OLED), Crystal IS, Inc. (GaN LED), Georgia Institute of Technology (III-N LED), Lehigh University (InGaN LED), PhosphorTech Corporation (SSL illumination material), DOE&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (SSL transportiong/hole blocking materials), DOE&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Sandia National Laboratories (InGaN materials for green LED), Arkema Inc. (Atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition for OLED lighting), Cree, Inc. (White SSL for general illumination), General Electric (LED with synthetic jet cooling), Osram Sylvania Development Inc. (Down lighting luminaire with 73% overall system efficiency), Philips Lumileds Lighting, LLC (135 lm/W 1050 lm warm white-LED for illumination), Universal Display Corporation (Phosphorescent OLED-based ceiling illumination system).<br />

This is a good step toward increasing energy efficiency for the entire US. As many of you know, incandescent light is more efficient at generating heat than light. On the other hand fluorescent light requires the use toxic materials such as mercury and is a potential hazardous waste and must be disposed of correctly. Although $21 million is not a great deal of investment by the DOE, it is nonetheless a step toward improving our nation's energy efficiency and reducing our dependence on electricity-generating natural resources such as crude oil, which is mostly imported.<br />
