<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/16/2801946/philips-smart-tv-hdtv-3d-2012">Aaron Souppouris, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Philips has today announced a refresh of its HDTV lineup, revealing nineteen new LED-backlit smart TVs for 2012. The company is bringing its smart TV platform to almost its entire range, from the 55-inch flagship Ambilight model right down to its low-end 19-inch 720p set.</blockquote></p>
<p><em>Nineteen</em>. There's lots of speculation about Apple entering the TV market. No one knows anything for sure, but the one thing I do know is Apple won't ever, no matter how successful its TV business becomes, announce nineteen TVs. My recommendation to Philips is to focus on at most three models: M, L, XL. And don't use cryptic model names like 6000 series or 7000 series. No one knows what the crap they mean.</p>
