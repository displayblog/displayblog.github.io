  an unfortunate situation where the slippery <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=iphone\">iPhone</a>
  fell through your hand and onto the floor cracking the LCD, Brando might have a
  solution for you. Of course, if you're like a friend of mine who has broken his
  mobile phone TWICE by accidentally dropping it in the toilet, you'll probably have
  insurance and in that case you can get a new one (after paying the deductible).
  But if you're not insured, check out <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=brando\">Brando</a>'s
  iPhone Kit.\r\n\r\n"

The iPhone Kit comes with a replacement LCD and iPhone Opening Tools Kit that includes a couple of screwdrivers and a few other interesting tools that will help you pry open your iPhone without causing more damage. If you're steady with the hand and know a thing or two about fixing things, and with the price of only US$85, Brando's iPhone Kit might just be the trick in getting back your iPhone in fully functioning shape. Oh, the iPhone Opening Tools Kit will run you another US$11, bringing the total to a bit more expensive US$96.</p>
