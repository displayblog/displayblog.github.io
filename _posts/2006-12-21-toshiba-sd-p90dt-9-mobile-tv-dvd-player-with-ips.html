<p>Toshiba's SD-P90DT is a portable DVD player, but it can also be used as a mobile TV via its 1-seg capability. Of course, 1-seg mobile TV service means you're limited to the Japanese market. The SD-P90DT is DivX Home Theater Certified and can playback CD-R/RW, DVD-R/RW, DivX, MP3 and WMA formated disks. With a portable DVD player like the SD-P90DT, you will often have at least two heads butting against each other to get a better view of the screen. Not so with the 9" LCD that's incorporated into the SD-P90DT.</p>

<p>You see, the 9" LCD is of the IPS type. IPS is synonymous with great viewing angles and very good color fidelity. Expect 170-degree viewing angles up/down and left/right. With the SD-P90DT two heads can view the large 9" LCD at fairly wide angles without losing much in contrast ratio and color. Of course, great technology doesn't come cheap and Toshiba's SD-P90DT is without exception: 69,800 JPY or about US$590.</p>
