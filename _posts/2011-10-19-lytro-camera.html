<blockquote><p>For now, it really is just a novel toy. [...] but mark our words &mdash; when Lytro integrates this kind of tech into a larger, more potent shooter: game over.</blockquote></p>
<p>I'd like to see shoot first, focus later on video, too.</p>

<blockquote><p>It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s hard enough for many of us to justify anything between a smartphone and a DSLR today, but with a high-end compact, you could at least say that the photos are better quality than the phone&acirc;&euro;&trade;s. If the Lytro can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t produce better photos than the phone, it won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t matter that you can refocus them later.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote><p>If you think of it as a regular camera, it's a disappointment. If you think of it as an amazing photographic novelty, it's a blast.</blockquote></p>
