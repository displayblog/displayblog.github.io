<p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/04/18/technology/mobile/verizon-iphone/index.html">CNN</a>: That's quarter over quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. Year over year Verizon's iPhone activations grew 25%.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_4S">Wikpedia</a>, the iPhone 4S was announced on October 4, 2011, become available for pre-order on October 7, and was available for in-store sales on October 14.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_5">Wikipedia</a>, the iPhone 5 was announced on September 12, 2012, became available for pre-order on September 14, and was available for in-store sales on September 21.</p>
<p>Comparing fourth quarters, the iPhone 5 had 14 extra days than the iPhone 4S. One way to look at this is to assume more of the folks who wanted the iPhone 5 bought it in the fourth quarter, leaving less of those who wanted the iPhone 5 to buy in the first quarter of 2013.</p>
<p>It also might be more than before folks who wanted the iPhone 5 bought it for other carriers such as AT&T and Sprint. And some have been waiting for the iPhone 5 to become available on T-Mobile, which started selling the iPhone 5 on April 12, 2013.</p>
<p>Not everyone was happy about the iPhone 5's redesign, but to think the iPhone 5 is not selling well because of a steeper drop in activations quarter over quarter in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the drop in activations quarter over quarter in the first quarter of 2012 is probably premature. We'll have to wait and see how the iPhone 5 sold at other carriers in the U.S. and worldwide to make a definitive conclusion. We will find out <a href="http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/13houbqwdvowuhb04/event/index.html">on April 23, 2013 when Apple announces calendar year first quarter 2013 results</a>.</p>
