<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/22/5926875/samsung-curved-105-inch-4k-tv-price-announced">The Verge</a>: The UN105S9W is Samsung's 105-inch 4K TV. It's curved, sports a 21:9 pixel format, and priced at one penny under US$120,000. Each model is built to order and you can pre-order one starting this week.</p>
<p>I've seen a curved 105-inch 21:9 4K TV and I had to get pretty close to the TV for its curviness to make the experience of watching TV more than ordinary. Unless my field of view is almost completely filled &mdash; which will probably take a curved 150-inch or larger 21:9 4K TV &mdash; curvy won't be satisfactory.</p>
