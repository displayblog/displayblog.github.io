<p><a href="http://www.changewaveresearch.com/articles/2012/ipad_20120402.html">ChangeWave</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>User satisfaction with the new iPad is even higher than previous iPad ratings from a February 2012 ChangeWave survey.  More than four-out-of-five new iPad owners (82%) say they are <em>Very Satisfied</em> with the device.</blockquote></p>
<p>Only 200 new owners were surveyed, but it seems the new iPad is off to a good start.</p>
