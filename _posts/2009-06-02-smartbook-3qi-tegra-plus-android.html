  Smartbooks will eschew the weakest part of the equation: Windows (or Linux). Instead
  of these clunky operating systems*, smartbooks will use the lightweight smartphone-geared
  Android OS from Google. Advanced features such as touch, auto-tilt, etc. can be

You consume too much energy. Good bye! Welcome Tegra! NVIDIA's Tegra chipset provides awesome graphics while sipping power. With Tegra you don't need to compromise graphics performance and you'll get many more hours to play with your smartbook than if you had an Atom powering it.</p>
<p><strong>Ultra-low-power LCD</strong> The last but certainly not least component that needs to change is the display. Current LCDs even with <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=led+backlight&amp;sa=Search#1708">LED backlight</a>s consume quite a bit of power. I'd say around 25 to 30 percent of an entire netbook system. Just a hunch. To bring power consumption down considerably there are a couple of options: one is the hope that some day we'll see an OLED display large enough and cheap enough to be used for $399 netbooks. I'm not holding my breath. The best alternative now to the regular LED-backlit LCD is Pixel Qi's <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=3qi&amp;sa=Search#811">3qi</a> display that has two modes. One is full power, full color, transmissive mode. The other is ultra-low-power reflective mode that <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/06/01/pixel-qi-3qi-vs-amazon-kindle-e-ink/">looks even better than Amazon's Kindle's E Ink display</a>.</p>
<p>Losers in this transition from netbook to smartbook? Intel and Microsoft. The winners? <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22pixel+qi%22&amp;sa=Search#1346">Pixel Qi</a>, NVIDIA and Google.</p>
<p>*Big, slow and requiring hefty hardware resources compared to Android, which was designed with smartphones in mind.</p>
