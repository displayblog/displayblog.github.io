<p>Dieter Bohn, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/9/6124253/apple-watch-hands-on-video-photos">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We got our hands on the smaller model first, and it feels very solid and surprisingly light. The sapphire screen curves down to run flush with the rest of the pebble-shaped body, and the screen itself was crisp and viewable &mdash; though it did seem to be a little more reflective than I expected.</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple is pushing a more active lifestyle with Apple Watch. Active means outside, outside means sunny, and sunny means the display on the Apple Watch will need to be easy to use in the sun.</p>
