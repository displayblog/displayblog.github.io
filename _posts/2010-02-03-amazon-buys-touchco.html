<p>Touchco brings interpolating force-sensitive resistance tech to Amazon. The startup's touch technology can be made completely transparent, works with color LCDs, and can detect an unlimited number of simultaneous touch points.</p>
<p><strong>Shift To LCD?</strong> Is Amazing making a shift from E Ink to color LCDs in the next version of the Kindle? Or will there be a touch-enabled e-book reader in addition to the Kindle using a color LCD? Scratch all of that. I later realized that Touchco touch technology can be applied to E Ink displays as well. The slow refreshing E Ink screen might be a problem and a touch overlay reduces display quality,&Acirc;&nbsp;but maybe Touchco has good solutions for these problems. A future Kindle with touch capability is certainly in the works.&Acirc;&nbsp;Source: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/04/technology/04amazon.html">The New York Times</a> <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/02/03/amazon-buys-touchscreen-startup-touchco-merging-with-kindle-div/">Engadget</a></p>
