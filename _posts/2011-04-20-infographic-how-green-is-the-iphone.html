<p><a href="http://blog.geekaphone.com/2011/04/19/green-iphone/">Geekaphone</a>: A "tasty inforgraphic" explaining how green the iPhone is. There is one minor error though. The LCD screen is shown as coming from Japan but actually the 3.5-inch IPS TFT LCD Retina Display used in the iPhone 4 primarily comes from LG Display, a South Korea-based company. The second source is Samsung, also based in South Korea.</p>
