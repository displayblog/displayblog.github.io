<p>David Zax, <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/helloworld/27043">MIT Technology Review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The paper almost treats 3D like a strain of some virus that can't be contained, only treated. The assumption appears to be that 3D is here to stay, and that as good epidemiologists we must do what we can to mitigate the damage it inflicts.</blockquote></p>
<p>The paper is <a href="http://www.journalofvision.org/content/11/8/11.abstract"><em>The zone of comfort: Predicting visual discomfort with stereo displays</em></a>.</p>
