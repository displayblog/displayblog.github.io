<p>At the end of the iPhone 6 and Apple Watch unveiling event, Apple pushed U2&acirc;&euro;&trade;s new album <em>Songs of Innocence</em> to 500 million folks who have accounts on iTunes. Here are some reactions to what Apple and U2 did:</p>
<p><a href="http://lefsetz.com/wordpress/index.php/archives/2014/09/10/u2-blew/">Bob Lefsetz</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This looked like nothing so much as what it was, old farts using their connections to shove material down the throats of those who don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t want it. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s what we hate so much about today&acirc;&euro;&trade;s environment, rich people who think they know better and [are] entitled to their behavior.</blockquote></p>
<p>Sasha Frere-Jones, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sasha-frere-jones/u2s-forgettable-fire">The New Yorker</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t shove your music into people&acirc;&euro;&trade;s homes. A U2 album that some would have taken seriously was instead turned into an album that seems as pointless as it probably is. Lack of consent is not the future.</blockquote></p>
<p>Lewis Wallace, <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/295084/u2-apple-event/">Cult of Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But trotting out aging Irish rockers after you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve wowed the world with the first glimpse of the glorious Apple Watch? That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not thinking different. That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a pity-fuck for a band that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s lost its edge, and an unfortunate bum note for a company that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s rarely perceived as tone-deaf.</blockquote></p>
<p>Perhaps it is not the company that is tone-deaf. Here are some reactions to <em>Songs of Innocence</em>:</p>
<p>Alexis Petridis, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/11/u2-songs-of-innocence-review">The Guardian</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nevertheless, Songs of Innocence isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t a bad album as such. The only person who&acirc;&euro;&trade;d agree with Cook&acirc;&euro;&trade;s suggestion that The Miracle (of Joey Ramone) amounts to &acirc;&euro;&oelig;the most incredible single you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve ever heard&acirc;&euro;¬ù is someone who hasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t heard many singles.</blockquote></p>
<p>Steven Hyden, <a href="http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/u2-songs-of-innocence-apple-icloud-album-review-11-takeaways/">Grantland</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Songs of Innocence</em> isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t a bad album, exactly, but it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s among U2&acirc;&euro;&trade;s bottom five records. [...] It justifies its own existence, but just barely.</blockquote></p>
<p>Tom Breihan, <a href="http://www.stereogum.com/1704542/premature-evaluation-u2-songs-of-innocence/franchises/premature-evaluation/">Stereogum</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For all that, <em>Songs Of Innocence</em> isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t an out-and-out disaster. The album has good moments, if you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re ready to dig for them.</blockquote></p>
<p>Lindsay Zoladz, <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2014/09/album-review-u2-songs-of-innocence-apple-iphone.html">Vulture</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[...] <em>Songs of Innocence</em> is an argument for the album-as-background-noise, or maybe just the album-as-accessory-to-technology, the forgettable prize drowning in the much-more-desired Crackerjacks.</blockquote></p>
<p>I have not listened to <em>Songs of Innocence</em>, and I do not plan to. I have tried a few times to download the free songs I have been gifted by Apple but have not been able to; maybe that is a blessing in disguise. If you want to remove the songs from your iTunes music library and purchases this <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT6439">Apple support page</a> shows you how.</p>
<p>U2 lost me at <em>Zooropa</em>, but I still enjoy listening to songs from <em>Joshua Tree</em> and <em>Rattle and Hum</em>. I am certain there are some who are enjoying the new and free album from U2, but from where I am sitting it seems the giveaway and the music they gave away were both lukewarm.</p>
