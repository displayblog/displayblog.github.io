<p>ASUS just announced that its 20" and 22" LCD monitors with DisplayLink are now available. Both have a pixel format of 1680 x 1050. If you remember DisplayLink allows connecting up to 6 monitors via a single USB connection. I have been waiting for a simple way to connect multiple monitors to my notebook PC and didn't want to purchase a desktop and add two dual DVI graphics cards. I hope more monitor brands announce DisplayLink capable monitors soon.</p>
