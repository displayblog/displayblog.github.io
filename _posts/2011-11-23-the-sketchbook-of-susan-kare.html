<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/neurotribes/2011/11/22/the-sketchbook-of-susan-kare-the-artist-who-gave-computing-a-human-face/">Steve Silberman</a>. Susan Kare was responsible for the icons in the early days of the Macintosh. One look and you can't help but think limitation catalyzes creativity. There's lot's more brilliant sketches. And if you're interested in purchasing Kare's icons she sells limited edition prints at <a href="http://www.kareprints.com/">Susan Kare Prints</a>.</p>
