The mbook BZ by UMID is tiny: 6.33x3.79x0.75 inches. The 4.8-inch touch TFT LCD is small too but boasts an impressive 1024x600 pixel format. Other specs include: 1.2GHz Intel Atom Z515 CPU, 512MB RAM, 16GB SSD, 1.3MP webcam, WiFi BG, Bluetooth 2.0+EDR, USB, 3.5-mm headphone, VGA, microSD and a 2600mAh Li-Ion battery good for a rated 7 hours. UMID certainly injected a lot of stuff into such a small ultraportable PC. The mbook BZ runs Windows XP Home and has a full QWERTY keyboard. Great, but.</p>
<p>You're not going to touch type on the tiny keyboard; I don't think you can thumb type either. And that's the main problem with the mbook BZ: it isn't optimized for a particular type of computing experience. The hardware, OS and software are all working by itself and not one is optimized to work within the confines of another. It isn't big enough to make use of the keyboard, unless you have a toddler who can touch type. But the keyboard isn't small enough for an average person to even thumb type. I don't think the display is big enough to make good use of Windows XP. It certainly is small enough to be portable (man bag?) but isn't small enough to be pocketable. I don't think you can really read stuff on that tiny screen.</p>
<p>The mbook BZ is a marvel of miniaturization but was developed with no particular computing experience in mind. I'm unsure whether UMID was even thinking that an average sized adult human being would be using it.
