<blockquote><p>While acknowledging there should be a roadmap for each generation of products, the sources insisted that touch panel shipments for iPhone 4 have remained steady, and that they have not seen a timetable to stop current production in preparation for the next-generation of iPhone.</blockquote></p>
<p>Maybe the touch panel is the same on the iPhone 4 as it is on the next one. If it was there wouldn't need to be any changes. Which doesn't surprise me because I think industrial design will be the same. The things change will probably limited to the inside: like the dual-core A5, faster GPU, etc. Hopefully Apple will make the iPhone a global one, meaning there would be just a single model that can be used for either or both GSM and CDMA networks.</p>
