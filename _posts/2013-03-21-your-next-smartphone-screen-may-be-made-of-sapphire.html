<p>Kevin bullis, <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/512411/your-next-smartphone-screen-may-be-made-of-sapphire/">MIT Technology Review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Manufactured sapphire&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a material that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s used as transparent armor on military vehicles&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;could become cheap enough to replace the glass display covers on mobile phones. That could mean smartphone screens that don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t crack when you drop them and can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be scratched with keys, or even by a concrete sidewalk.</blockquote></p>
<p>Among natural materials only diamonds are harder than sapphire. Compared to Gorilla Glass sapphire is roughly 3x stronger and 3x more scratch resistant.</p>
