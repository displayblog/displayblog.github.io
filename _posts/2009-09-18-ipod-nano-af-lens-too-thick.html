<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/09/naked-nano/">Wired</a>: <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/09/in-qa-steve-jobs-snipes-at-amazon-and-praises-ice-cream/">David Pogue spent some time with Steve Jobs</a> (Steve is eating a lot of ice cream... lucky him!) after Apple's iPod Show that was held in San Francisco on September 9, 2009. David asked Steve Jobs why the new&Acirc;&nbsp;iPod nano can record video but can't take still photos. Steve said the reason was technical: sensors that can record video are very thin and can easily fit inside a device like the nano. On the other hand, image sensors with enough resolution for stills and autofocus like the one found in the iPhone 3GS are thick--too thick to cram into the Nano that is only 0.2 inches thick. iFixit confirms...</p>
<p>Kyle Wiens, iFixit CEO (<a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPod-nano-5th-Generation/1157/1">check out the tear down of the new iPod nano</a>), confirmed the explanation: </p>
<blockquote><p>The camera in the iPhone is thicker than the entire nano. The AF lenses really bulks it up.</blockquote></p>
<p>So although you can take 640 x 480 (VGA) videos at 30fps on the nano, you will not be able to take still pictures.&Acirc;&nbsp;My guess is that the next major development in lens technology will be to make an AF still-image sensor much thinner without any quality degradation. When that happens you can also expect even thinner devices that may sport two of them: one facing forward and the other facing backward for video phone calls and taking pictures or videos. I think within the next 6-9 months the AF still-image sensor will become thinner. And the next generation iPod nano and the iPod touch will have capabilities to take pictures and video.</p>
