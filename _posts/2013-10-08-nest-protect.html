<p>Steven Levy, <a href="http://www.wired.com/business/2013/10/nest-smoke-detector/all/#slideid-116281">Wired</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The $129 Nest Protect, launching this fall, is a handsome white square with rounded corners and an op-arty sunflower pattern. When smoke or carbon monoxide reaches a government-specified level of peril, the device performs like every other alarm. But what sets Nest Protect apart is its vocal warning before things get that bad.</blockquote></p>
<p>Tony Fadell and his team at Nest is rejuvenating mundane products by scratching itches we've all been itching to scratch. The ugly, dumb and annoying, cheap smoke alarm has now been transformed into a beautiful, simple, and not-so-cheap smart smoke alarm.</p>
