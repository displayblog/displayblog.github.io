<p><a href="http://fosspatents.blogspot.com/2011/11/european-commission-investigates.html">Florian Mueller, FOSS Patents</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Samsung's various attempts to shut down Apple products -- most recently the iPhone 4S -- with patents declared essential to the 3G industry standard have now given rise to an antitrust investigation by Europe's top competition "watchdog". This is the most important development to date related to the world-spanning dispute between these two companies. This investigation has the potential to force Samsung to withdraw most of its claims against Apple, but let's not forget that the underlying issue concerns the technology industry at large. Everyone -- not just Apple -- relies on FRAND standards.</blockquote></p>
