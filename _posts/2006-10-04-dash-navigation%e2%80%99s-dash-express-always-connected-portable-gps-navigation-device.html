<p>The Dash Express is the first portable GPS navigation device that has enhanced two-way traffic capability and can also be used as an automotive Internet appliance. As an Internet device, the Dash Express can use its always on GPRS-based cellular connection to find just about anything using Google searches. Some of the items you can search for are gas prices at gas stations, food items served at restaurants, and the service will cost $13 per month. When there is a WiFi signal available, the Dash Express will use that signal for faster Internet connectivity. As a GPS device, road conditions, and three possible routes per destination are provided. The Dash Express will most likely retail for less than $600 - $800 when it becomes available in the summer of 2007.</p>

<p>I couldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t find any information regarding the Dash Express&acirc;&euro;&trade; display, but it seems like a non-wide TFT LCD with a diagonal size range of around 4-5&acirc;&euro;&sup3; with possibly a 640 x 480 resolution.</p>
