<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/27/5755712/how-lgs-robot-lasers-produced-the-fastest-cameraphone">Vlad Savov, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The moment you enter the camera app, the G3 starts emitting a cone-shaped laser beam from a window just to the side of the camera. The phone then measures how long it takes for the light to bounce back to it and thus gets a reading of how far away the subject of the photo is.</blockquote></p>
<p>Time to autofocus? 276 milliseconds. Touch where you want to focus and the G3 will focus and take the shot too. <a href="http://galaxys5guide.com/samsung-galaxy-s5-features-explained/galaxy-s5-fast-auto-focus/">The Samsung Galaxy S5 uses a hybrid contrast & phase detection autofocus system and takes 0.3 seconds (300 milliseconds) to focus</a>. LG's camera UI is minimal as can be: one button for menu and a back button.</p>
