<p>HTC's Desire Z is a Android 2.2 QWERTY slider sporting a 5MP camera with flash, 720p HD video recording capability and powered by a 800MHz Qualcomm 7230 CPU. The display is a 3.7-inch TFT LCD featuring a 800x480 pixel format. A bit anti-climactic actually. No one is getting close to matching Apple's Retina Display in terms of pixel density it seems. The hardware design looks pretty good overall and the standard Android 2.2 is layered over with HTC's Sense UI.</p>
