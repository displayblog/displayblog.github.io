<p><a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110512006951/en/Samsung-Electronics-Nouvoyance-Demonstrate-10.1-inch-300dpi-WQXGA">BusinessWire</a>: Samsung is expected to showcase its 10.1-inch LCD geared toward tablet with a pixel format of 2560x1600 using a RGBW PenTile Matrix sub-pixel structure during SID 2011. Samsung claims the high resolution tablet LCD consumes 40% less power compared to typical RGB stripe LCDs. The 10.1-inch LCD sports a brightness of 300 to 600 nits, and a 72% color gamut. My guess is that future a future Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 might sport this very LCD.</p>
