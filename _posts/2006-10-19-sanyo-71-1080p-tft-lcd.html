<p>Wow. Now incorporate this into a UMPC design. Quick! It is amazing what Sanyo did squishing 1920 x 1080 pixels into just 7.1". 1080p content on something like this will look remarkable.</p>
<p>If Sanyo can put 1920 x 1080 on a 7.1" sized LCD, I'm guessing they can do it on 13.3? How about 1920 x 1080 resolution on a 13.3" MacBook? Prior to Sanyo's announcement, the smallest LCD size that sported a resolution that could display 1920 x 1080 resolution on the IT side was 15.4" (1920 x 1200).</p>
