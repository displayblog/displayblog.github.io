<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-30/jpmorgan-gives-its-investment-bankers-ipads-in-challenge-to-rim-blackberry.html">Bloomberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. lender by assets behind Bank of America, will distribute iPads free of charge to all associates in its global investment banking division, the Nov. 24 e-mail shows. Employees will get to keep the device as long as they remain at the unit until the pilot program ends on May 1, 2011.</blockquote></p>
<p>Two managing directors at JPMorgan, as to why:</p>
<blockquote><p>We believe there are real benefits in our working environment that can be realized using this device - as well as the personal productivity and enjoyment that come as part of the package.</blockquote></p>
