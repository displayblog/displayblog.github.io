<p><a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2370170,00.asp">PC Magazine</a>'s John Dvorak:</p>
<blockquote><p>Needless to say, I'm only hot on two platforms: Apple and Android. The thing to look out for&acirc;&euro;&ldquo;AKA the kiss of death&acirc;&euro;&ldquo;is when the competition begins to say, "It's not the number of apps that count, it's the quality of apps." That means that they've got nothing and will soon be out of the race. At the end of the day, it's always been a numbers game.</blockquote></p>
<p>A numbers game indeed: total units sold, number of apps, and most importantly profits.</p>
