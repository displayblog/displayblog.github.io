<p><a href="http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/201112/11-156E/index.html">Sony</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Under the agreement, Samsung will acquire all of Sony's shares of S-LCD Corporation (&acirc;&euro;&oelig;S-LCD&acirc;&euro;¬ù), the two companies' LCD panel manufacturing joint venture, making S-LCD a wholly owned subsidiary of Samsung. In consideration for the share transfer, cash consideration of approximately KRW 1.08 trillion will be paid to Sony by Samsung. [...]</p>
<p>For Sony, this transaction will enable it to monetize its shares in S-LCD and aims to secure a flexible and steady supply of LCD panels from Samsung, based on market prices and without the responsibility and costs of operating a manufacturing facility. With whole ownership of S-LCD, Samsung anticipates heightened flexibility, speed and efficiency in both panel production and business operations.</blockquote></p>
<p>That's about US$940 million. A big chunk of cash Sony desperately needs.</p>
