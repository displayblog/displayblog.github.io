<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2011/09/amazons_new_kindles">John Gruber at Daring Fireball</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>E-ink feels peaceful to me. The Kindle doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t feel like a computer. It feels &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; not to the touch but to the eyes and mind &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; like a crudely-typeset and slightly smudgily-printed paper book. That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a good thing. Battery life is un-computer-like as well: Amazon measures e-ink Kindle battery life in <em>months</em>, and they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re not joking. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a surprise when the Kindle actually needs a charge. I was a doubter until I owned one, but now I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m convinced that e-ink readers have tremendous value even in the post-iPad world.</blockquote></p>
<p>That's some praise. A display technology that can conjure up feelings of peace. The new Kindle Touch e-reader Amazon announced today sports a 6-inch 16-level grayscale 600x800 E Ink display with a multitouch layer. The resolution is just 167 ppi, but I have no doubt E Ink displays will only get better and at some point will challenge real paper for how comfortable it is to read off of: imagine an E Ink display that pushes 300 ppi.</p>
<p>Already it feels like "a crudely-typeset and slightly smudgily-printed paper book" to Gruber. I'd say that's off to a good start.</p>
