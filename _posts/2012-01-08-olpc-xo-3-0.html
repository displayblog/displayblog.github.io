<p>The actual OLPC XO 3.0 has turned out to be quite different from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/olpc/sets/72157623013465949/">the company's concept designs posted on Flickr</a>. But much of the inspiration remains. From <a href="http://laptop.org/en/laptop/hardware/xo3.shtml">OLPC's XO-3 page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Designed by <a href="http://www.fuseproject.com/">Yves Behar's Fuseproject</a>, the XO-3's new design features an all plastic tablet screen which is semi-flexible and extremely durable, and just like the original XO, the display can be optimized in both transmissive and reflective modes for indoor and outdoor lighting conditions. The XO-3 supports many use scenarios to fulfill kids&acirc;&euro;&trade; learning needs: from horizontal book mode to portrait reading mode to multi-touch--so many hands can play and learn together on the same screen--to a full-touch keyboard [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>The key, as a display geek, is the "optimized in both transmissive and reflective modes for indoor and outdoor lighting conditions."</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/1/8/2691733/olpc-xo-3-0-tablet-pictures-video">Joanna Stern, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>OLPC will offer two display options: a regular 8-inch 1024 x 768 LCD and then an 8-inch PixelQi, outdoor readable version. OLPC only brought the LCD version to the show, and while it's no IPS panel, I thought the display was decently bright. The touchscreen was responsive, but the slow software clearly holds it back.</blockquote></p>
<p>Given its target market the OLPC XO 3.0 tablet without the Pixel Qi display will be almost useless. But with the Pixel Qi, the price will likely be north of US$100. Equally important is the touch experience, which seems to be in need of a <em>lot</em> of work.</p>
<p>One brilliant innovation is the cover with a built-in solar panel and battery. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/elizabethwoyke/2012/01/08/a-look-at-olpcs-xo-3-0-tablets-solar-and-kinetic-chargers/">Elizabeth Woyke, Forbes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>OLPC has designed a snug-fitting cover for the tablet that sports a solar panel on one side and a thin-pack battery on the other. McNierney said OLPC envisions the tablet being used, via battery, while the solar panel charges. Once the panel is charged, the user can fit the cover onto the back of the tablet &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; it connects using four pins or electrical contacts &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; to power the device.</blockquote></p>
<p>That's Ed McNierney, CTO at OLPC. Looking for some nice photos of the XO 3.0? <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/01/08/olpcs-xo-3-0-tablet-hands-on/">Engadget</a> has a bunch.</p>
