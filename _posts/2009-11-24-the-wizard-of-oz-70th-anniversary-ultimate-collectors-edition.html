<p>Warner Home Video has been selling <em>The Wizard of Oz: 70th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition</em> since September but this <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=blu-ray&amp;sa=Search#1348">Blu-ray</a> is quite special. The two-disc numbered limited edition set has been mastered at 8K, the first time for a feature-length dramatic film. Each strip of the 3-strip Technicolor negative required 8K scanning. From these three 8K scans a "full film resolution" master was created in 4K. The final result is amazing picture quality at its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio.
