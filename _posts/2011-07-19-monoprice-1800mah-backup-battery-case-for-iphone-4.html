<blockquote><p>I think what I like most though is that it is stylish without adding a lot of additional weight or bulk.</blockquote></p>
<p>Useful, but stylish it is not. Priced at just US$23.63 though <a href="http://www.monoprice.com/products/product.asp?c_id=108&cp_id=10831&cs_id=1083110&p_id=8292&seq=1&format=2">the MonoPrice iPhone 4 battery case</a> is definitely a bargain.</p>
