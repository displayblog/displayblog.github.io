<p>[ <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0%2Fcd295840-db6c-11e5-98fd-06d75973fe09.html#axzz41EipFmL9">The Financial Times</a> ] Tim Bradshaw:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple is working on new ways to strengthen the encryption of customers&rsquo; iCloud backups in a way that would make it impossible for the company to comply with valid requests for data from law enforcement, according to people familiar with its plans.</blockquote></p>
<p>Not surprising that Apple wants to focus on making hardware, software, and services. And not become an arm of a government organization like the FBI.</p>
