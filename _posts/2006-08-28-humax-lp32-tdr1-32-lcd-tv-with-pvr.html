<p>Humax, short for Human Maximum? Who knows. But it's a name that I am not very familiar with. Maybe that will change in the near future. And its LP32-TDR1 will sure help bring that about. The LP32-TDR1 is a 32" LCD TV with a 160GB Personal Video Recorder (PVR). Not much is known but it will come with 2x Freeview TV tuners, inputs such as S-Video, 3x AC inputs, 2x SCARTs a HDMI port and sell for about 900 pounds (~US$1700) in Europe.</p>

<p>I'm guessing the display is a 1366 x 768 resolution low-end type with the typical specifications in the range of around 500:1 contrast ratio, 170+ degree viewing angles and a 8ms typical response time. The color gamut would be a run-of-the-mill 72% NTSC. Personally, I don't like integrated anything. The reason is simple: you have to send in the entire box if something goes wrong with any one thing. What if the PVR's firmware got messed up? Well, you're hosed with a TV that doesn't work. I like my CE gadgets to be separate. That's why I like my iPod--it does music well. Who really wants to view pictures or video on it anyway. I think it was a terrible move by Apple, but I'm just a peculiar guy and there are many more non-peculiar guys out there, so from a financial point of view Apple did the right thing by providing picture and video viewing capabilities on its tiny screen. Back to <strike>Human Maximum</strike> Humax... don't get it--get separate boxes that each do one thing well.</p>
