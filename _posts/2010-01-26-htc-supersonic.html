<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/HTC_Supersonic_Android_Smartphone.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9247 aligncenter" title="HTC_Supersonic_Android_Smartphone" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/HTC_Supersonic_Android_Smartphone.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="514" /></a>Whether an actual picture of HTC's Supersonic or merely a render, HTC's Android smartphone headed for Sprint looks quite good. And the lack of the idiotic ball found on the Nexus One is a relief. Looking at the Supersonic I wish Apple's iPhone was a bit more rectangular at the corners, but not as rectangular as the Droid.</p>
<p>Some of the leaked specs include: a 4.3-inch display, WiMAX and Sense. The 4.3-inch display is of the OLED variety. This OLED is 0.6 inches larger than 3.7-inch OLED used in the Nexus One, but the number of pixels should be the same at 800 x 480. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/01/20/nexus-one-pentile-matrix-oled-display/">Though I have some quibbles about that</a>.</p>
<p>I would prefer&Acirc;&nbsp; physical buttons instead of the touch versions. Do we really need <em>four</em> buttons?
