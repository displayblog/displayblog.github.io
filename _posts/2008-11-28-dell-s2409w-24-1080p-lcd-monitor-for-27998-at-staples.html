<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/dell_s2409w.jpg" alt="Dell S2409W: 24" /></p></p>
<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dell">Dell</a>'s S2409W is a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=24"-lcd-monitor">24" LCD monitor</a> that has a very simple and nice external design. It is also part of the new trend of shifting to a 16:9 aspect ratio and sporting a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a> pixel format much like LCD TVs. The S2409W features a TN TFT LCD so you won't be getting extreme viewing angles, but 170/160 should be good enough for a good portion of you guys since, I'm guessing like me, you're not looking at the monitor from the side most of the time. <a href="http://www.staples.com/office/supplies/p4__249923_Business_Supplies_1_10051_SC3:CG4:DP2000:CL142219">Get it now for just $279.98 at Staples</a>. That's $70.00 off the MSRP.</p>
