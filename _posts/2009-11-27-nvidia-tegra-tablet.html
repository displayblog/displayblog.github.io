<p>NVIDIA showed off its <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=tegra&amp;sa=Search#1243">Tegra</a> Tablet prototyped by ICD. Tegra-enabled kitchen tablet? You sure you want to watch a 720p video clip while cooking? I've said this before: when you design a display to be placed near a kitchen said display better be quite durable: water-proof, oil-proof, drop-proof, shock-proof, be able withstand accidental stabs by sharp objects like knives, etc. The NVIDIA Tegra Tablet is clearly not any of these. I would think it would be better used in the office in a safe environment by a techno-geek that takes good care of his/her gadgets.</p>
<p>As a tablet it is too big. Engadget's guess is around 15 to 16 inches: my guess is 15.6 inches with a 1366 x 768 pixel format. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=resistive+touch&amp;sa=Search#1363">Resistive touch</a> technology is employed. The chassis is quite thin at under an inch thick. Finger-based navigation on a keyboard-mouse-centric OS (Windows CE) looks quite clumsy ,but one interesting design was the dock/charging station: you dock the Tegra Tablet upright on what looks like a stand, similar to Palm's Touchstone. Quite nice. Source: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/11/27/nvidia-tegra-tablet-prototype-hands-on/">Engadget</a></p>
