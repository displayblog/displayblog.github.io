<p><a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/2014/09/thoughts-on-alibaba-bubble.php">John Battelle</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Let me put this another way: Here are a list of Internet leaders who decided to forego China, because the government has made it nearly impossible for them to do business in the way that built our capital markets: eBay, Yelp, Twitter, Google, Facebook&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; and that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s just off the top of my head. So by buying into Alibaba, we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re buying into a system that has, through government fiat, denied innovative US companies growth in the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s largest market, then capitalized that fiat into a stock it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s now selling back to us. Again, that just seems wrong.</blockquote></p>
