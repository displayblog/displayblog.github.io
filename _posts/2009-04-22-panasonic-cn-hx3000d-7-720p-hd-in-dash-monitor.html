<p><strong>720p</strong> Panasonic's CN-HX3000D is the first in-dash monitor that sports a real HD pixel format. The 7" monitor features a 1280 x 720 pixel format for real HD action in your car. The CN-HX3000D also includes GPS, Bluetooth, a 40GB hard disk, and is iPhone &amp; iPod compatible.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-5594 aligncenter" title="panasonic_cn_hx3000d_7_inch_hd_in_dash_monitor_1280_720" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/panasonic_cn_hx3000d_7_inch_hd_in_dash_monitor_1280_720.jpg" alt="panasonic_cn_hx3000d_7_inch_hd_in_dash_monitor_1280_720" width="366" height="450" /></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can pair the 7" 720p LCD monitor with the CY-BB1000D, which is an in-dash Blu-ray player and you've got the perfect HD setup in your car.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Better UI</strong> This is a huge improvement over the typical 7" in-dash monitors that only have a very limited number of pixels. You can see the limitation in movies but also in GPS navigation software where it almost looks cartoonish. Now with 1280 x 720 pixels I am sure everything will look great as long as the UI designers made good use of it. I'm anxious to see this thing in person.</p></p>
