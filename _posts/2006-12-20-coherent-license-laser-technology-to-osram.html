<p>On December 20, 2006, Coherent, Inc., a Santa Clara, California-based photonics-based solutions provider, announced that it has licensed its Optically Pumped Semiconductor Laser (OPSL) technology to OSRAM GmbH. This allows OSRAM to develop and market RGB lasers using OPSL technology for integration into applications such as projection TV ("<a href="http://displayblog.wordpress.com/2006/12/04/laser-tv/">Laser TV</a>"), pocket projectors and handheld devices. One of the main barriers for laser-based sources for backlights is cost. With OSRAM's manufacturing scale the cost of lasers are poised to drop. What questions me is how in the world will three lasers be incorporated into a handheld device? There is something really interesting cooking in the world of lasers.</p>
