<p><a href="http://thetechblock.com/the-unibody-iphone">Don Lehman, The Tech Block</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>An actual production sample of the next iPhone. This is where I would put my money. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m fairly convinced this is what the next iPhone will look like. If true, this design will be noteworthy for being the first unibody iPhone, making it the thinnest, strongest, and lightest housing to date.</blockquote></p>
<p>Unibody chassis construction with integrated bosses has been an important feature in almost all Apple's products. It won't be surprising to see the next iPhone sport a unibody design. I just hope the final product doesn't have a back that's as ugly.</p>
