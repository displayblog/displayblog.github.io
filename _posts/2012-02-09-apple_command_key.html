<p><a href="http://folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Swedish_Campground.txt">Andy Hertzfeld</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Finally she came across a floral symbol that was used in Sweden to indicate an interesting feature or attraction in a campground. She rendered a 16 x 16 bitmap of the little symbol and showed it to the rest of the team, and everybody liked it. Twenty years later, even in OS X, the Macintosh still has a little bit of a Swedish campground in it.</blockquote></p>
