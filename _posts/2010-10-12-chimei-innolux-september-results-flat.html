<p>Chimei Innolux (CMI) announced on October 11th that its LCD-related revenues grew 0.1% M/M to NT$45.6 billion in September. CMI's third quarter revenues decreased 5.2% Q/Q to NT$137 billion.</p>
<p>Third quarter is usually a very good quarter for LCD suppliers like CMI. Not this year. Due to a global economic standstill LCD inventory ballooned at several points in the supply chain and that caused LCD panel prices to tumble, negatively affecting revenues and profits.
