Steve Jobs, as far as I know, <a href="http://www.quora.com/SteveJobs/Steve-never-sold-any-Apple-stock-during-his-entire-second-term-at-the-company">never sold his share of Apple stocks</a> after he returned in 1997; <a href="http://www.macnews.com/2012/03/13/tim-cook-sells-37500-rsus-awarded-him-apple">Tim Cook just unloaded a buttload</a>. Steve Jobs did not captain a ship that leaks from the top; <a href="http://www.macnn.com/articles/12/03/09/reiterates.an.earlier.promise/">Tim Cook doesn't seem to be as strict</a>. <a href="/2010/10/18/steve-jobs-7-inch-tablets-doa/">Steve Jobs thought the 7-inch tablet was DOA</a>; Tim Cook might think different.</p>
