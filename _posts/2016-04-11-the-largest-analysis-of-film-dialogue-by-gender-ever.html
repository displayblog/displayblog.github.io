<p>[ <a href="http://polygraph.cool/films/index.html">Polygraph</a> ] Amazing research, intensely detailed with data beautifully animated and visualized by Hanah Anderson and Matt Daniels:</p>
<blockquote><p>But it&rsquo;s all rhetoric and no data, which gets us nowhere in terms of having an informed discussion. How many movies are actually about men? What changes by genre, era, or box-office revenue? What circumstances generate more diversity?</p>
<p>To begin answering these questions, we Googled our way to 8,000 screenplays and matched each character&rsquo;s lines to an actor. From there, we compiled the number of words spoken by male and female characters across roughly 2,000 films, arguably the largest undertaking of script analysis, ever.</blockquote></p>
<p>Every element represents something meaningful; nothing went to waste. I think Edward Tufte would be proud of this work.</p>
