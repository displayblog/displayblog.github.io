<p><a href="http://www.canalys.com/newsroom/android-takes-almost-50-share-worldwide-smart-phone-market">Canalys</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Android, the number one platform by shipments since Q4 2010, was also the strongest growth driver this quarter, with Android-based smart phone shipments up 379% over a year ago to 51.9 million units. Growth was bolstered by strong Android product performances from a number of vendors, including Samsung, HTC, LG, Motorola, Sony Ericsson, ZTE and Huawei. The final country-level data delivered to clients today shows there were particularly strong performances from Android devices in APAC countries, such as South Korea, where Android holds an 85% platform share, and Taiwan, where it has 71%.</p>
<p>With shipments of 20.3 million iPhones and a market share of 19%, iOS overtook Nokia&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Symbian platform during the quarter to take second place worldwide. In doing so, Apple also became the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s leading individual smart phone vendor, stripping Nokia of its long-held leadership position.</blockquote></p>
<p>Android is undoubtedly the fastest-growing smartphone OS in the world, in terms of unit sales. What's interesting is the 85%-share in South Korea. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/02/24/google-must-south-korea/">Not surprising though</a>. Unfortunately for the brands that make Android smartphones there is very little profit. According to Horace Dediu, <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2011/07/29/apple-captured-two-thirds-of-available-mobile-phone-profits-in-q2/">Apple captured two thirds of available mobile phone profits in Q2</a>.</p>
