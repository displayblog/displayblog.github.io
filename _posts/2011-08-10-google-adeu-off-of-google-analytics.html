<p>In my on-going pursuit in reducing my reliance on Google services (read <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/08/08/google-adeu/"><em>Google, Ad&Atilde;&copy;u.</em></a>), I have now eliminated Google Analytics code from DisplayBlog. The alternative? It was there all along: my web host tracks traffic. A bit less convenient than Analytics, but offers enough analytics for my needs.</p>
<p>So I have effectively reduced my exposure to Google in these service areas: Google search, Gmail, Google Reader, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/08/09/moving-away-from-google-feedburner/">FeedBurner</a>. Next is Google Docs.</p>
<p>PS: I am finding it difficult using Bing as my Internet search engine. The one feature I miss from Google is the ability to easily limit the timeframe. My assumption is more recent results are more relevant than older ones. I find this to be generally, but not always, true. Any suggestions on a better search engine than Bing or Yahoo?</p>
