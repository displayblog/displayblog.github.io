<p>The Fujitsu F-A50 all-in-one PC looks somewhat similar to the last-generation Apple iMac. The main difference, in terms of design, being the stand that allows height adjustment and tilting of the screen.</p>

<p>Many users of the iMac did wish the unit to have height adjustment, but that just wasn't possible with Apple's simplistic design focus for all of its products including the iMac.</p>
<p>The Fujitsu F-A50 has a 16" LCD sporting a pixel format of 1366 x 768. As you know, this format is commonly found on lower end LCD TVs up to about 42". Beyond that nearly all LCD TVs feature 1920 x 1080 that can handle 1080p content. There are many folks in Japan that like to use all-in-one PCs as their entertainment systems. I can understand why. The rooms are smaller and each device that takes up space need to be carefully utilized. I would probably use my 17" notebook PC as the main entertainment system if I were to live in a very small one bedroom apartment with not much else.</p>
<p>But, on to the display...</p>
<p>I've voiced my opinion on this topic before, but here goes. What is 1366 x 768? What is this nonsense? Sure, it has an aspect ratio of 16:9, but so does a lot of other pixel formats. Have we heard a 768p video format?!? I certainly haven't. I've heard of 720p but not 768p. So why don't we see 1280 x 720 on LCDs? Just get rid of this in-between nothing of a pixel format and get an actual standard there instead (1280 x 720) or just skip it all together and move to 1920 x 1080. 1366 x 768??? Come on.</p>
