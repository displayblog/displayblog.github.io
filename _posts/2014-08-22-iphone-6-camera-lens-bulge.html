<p><a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2014/08/22/iphone-6-leak-foxconn-dimensions/">MacRumors</a>: The 4.7-inch iPhone 6 (codenamed N56) will have its camera lens bulge out 0.77 mm. The 5.5-inch iPhone 6 (codenamed N61) has two prototypes: the first prototype bulged out 0.77 mm while the second prototype bulges out 0.67 mm.</p>
<p>The camera lens bulging out from the body. Sounds and looks terrible. But I thought, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;There must be a good reason for Apple to do this. What could it be?&acirc;&euro;¬ù Here's an idea: the bulge is made of steel and to it you can attach magnetized lens accessories. That could be cool. But my preference is no camera lens bulge.</p>
