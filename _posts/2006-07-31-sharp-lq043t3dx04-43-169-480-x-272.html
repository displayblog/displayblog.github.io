<p>Sony's PlayStation Portable has created a trend toward 4.3" wide displays with a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 resolution. Sharp has announced a display with the same features, the LQ043T3DX04. It uses Sharp's wide-viewing technology called Advanced Super View (ASV) providing viewing angles of 160 degrees. Contrast ratio is 400:1, and the unit displays 16.7 million colors. The advanced feature of the LQ043T3DX04 is the use of LED backlighting, instead of the usual CCFL. LED backlights are generally more durable than CCFL but emits more heat. I am assuming Sharp developed a method of managing heat dissipation in LED backlights. The operating temperature has been extended to -20 to +60C with a brightness of 230 cd/m2.</p>

<p>Sharp is planning a touch version of this panel, which would be great for portable multimedia players (PMPs). Samples will be available in September and mass production is scheduled to start in the fourth quarter of 2006.</p>
