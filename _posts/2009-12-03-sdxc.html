<p>64GB SDXC cards at 35 MB/s sounds exciting. Until you realize you can't use it with the SD slot on your notebook PC. Good news (if you were planning on purchasing a new notebook PC): <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=lenovo&amp;sa=Search#1348">Lenovo</a>, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=dell&amp;sa=Search#1348">Dell</a>, and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=hp&amp;sa=Search#1363">HP</a> will incorporate SDXC slots in their Arrandale CPU-equipped notebook PCs. Personally, I tend to keep my notebook PC for more than a few years, so my recommendation to those that do the same is to purchase a notebook PC without a SD slot and instead get a SD reader. SD readers a much less expensive to upgrade. I have a feeling there will be bigger and faster SD solutions in the coming years.
