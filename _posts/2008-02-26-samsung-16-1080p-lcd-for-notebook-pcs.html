<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=samsung">Samsung</a> Electronics is bringing a bit of CE to IT with a new 16" LCD geared for notebook PC applications. The 16" will have a 16:9 aspect ratio, instead of the standard 16:10. And that means the pixel format will be <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a> rather than 1920 x 1200. When watching <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1080p">1080p </a>content the notebook will not need to scale and nor will you see top and bottom black bars when viewing 1:1. Targeted to consumers? Absolutely.</p>
<p>Samsung's original plan was to introduce the 16" 1080p LCD panel in Q1'08 but due to delays in verification and changes in specification, Samsung is pushing back the availability to Q3'08. But, I guess <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=acer">Acer</a> and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=hp">HP</a> was easy on Samsung as they are slated to introduce 16" 1080p <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=notebook-pc">notebook PC</a>s in 1H'08. Acer will receive its panels in April. The 16" 1080p panels can be manufactured in any one of Samsung's many LCD fabs. For instance, Samsung can cut eighteen 16" 1080p panels one one glass substrate at its Gen. 5 line.</p>
<p>Pricing will be a bit higher than the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=15.4"">15.4"</a> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1200">1920 x 1200</a> LCD panel by about US$60-$70. That's a lot for just 0.6" more. But Digitimes is reporting that 16" 1080p notebook PCs will be of the high-end variety, most likely to be touting a Blu-ray drive for 1080p viewing pleasure. Isn't it great to have the high definition optical wars over?</p>
<p>Currently really high-resolution notebook PCs are not very popular. Not really because of price, though that can be a hindrance, but because the fonts are too small. Unless you have the eyes of a teenager that have not been damaged by too much <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=ps3">PS3</a> playing, it will be difficult to see any menus or icons on a 15.4" 1920 x 1200 screen. So, in the world of notebook PCs, only 4-6% have these 15.4" high-resolution screens. And 16" 1080p screens are expected to capture even less market share than that.</p>
<p>AU Optronics (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=auo">AUO</a>) and Chi Mei Optoelectronics (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=cmo">CMO</a>) will be launching a slightly larger 15.6" LCD panel geared for notebook PC applications in June. And <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=asus">Asustek</a>, a bigger than before brand thanks to the Eee PC, will be launching a 15.6" notebook in 2H'08.</p>
<p>Confusion. Although new sizes can be exciting and it certainly can be for those that are eager to view Blu-ray 1080p content on their notebook PCs, the general notebook PC-buying consumer will be in utter confusion for a while. Let's see, you have 15.0" 4x3, 15.4" 16:10 (and at multiple pixel formats), 15.6" 16:9, 16:0" 16:9, 17" 16:10 (multiple pixel formats), 19" 16:10, 20" 20:10. Wow. And I didn't even list the small sizes. If I were in the market for a new notebook PC, I wouldn't know where to start. Actually, I'm lying. I'd just get one from Apple.</p>
