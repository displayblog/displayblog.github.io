<p>CMO has doggedly manufactured 27" LCD TV panels with 1280 x 720 resolution when the rest of the world marched at a slightly different tune: 26" with 1366 x 768 resolution. Now CMO has seen the light and will be producing what the rest has been producing. CMO currently has 20", 27", 32", 37", 42" and 47" LCD TV panels. CMO does have something that no other has, a 3840 x 2160 56" LCD TV panel called Quad Full HD or QFHD, a bit geeky, but still great. Going back to the 27", I personally like that resolution because 720p content will require absolutely no scaling and will result in better video quality compared to a TV panel that has 1366 x 768. The 1366 x 768 has an aspect ratio of 16:9 but any HD content including 720p will require scaling. Any scaling will deteriorate the video quality from a little to a lot depending on what scaler the TV comes with. It is sad that whatever is expedient to make is pushed onto the consumer without really developing that will bring about the best quality. I'm glad to see TV panel guys making 1920 x 1080 resolution displays instead of something stupid like 2133 x 1200 since they already have driver ICs that display 1200 horizontal lines.
