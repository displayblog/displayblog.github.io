<p>C.S. Lewis' <em>The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader</em> ebook has been enhanced, with multimedia. It is in EPUB format and is available on <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-voyage-dawn-treader-enhanced/id396557408?mt=11">iBooks</a> for US$10.</p>
<p>It is a natural evolution of the ebook to include multimedia. I can see the potential especially for multimedia etextbooks and ebooks like <em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em>.</p>

<p>But there is a problem that needs to get untangled and <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/11/enhanced-narnia-e-book-has-promise-restrictions/">Wired</a> sums it up quite well:</p>
<blockquote><p>Again and again, enhanced e-books bump up against rights that have already been sold and assigned. The video content, including an animated timeline/summary of the story, is solid, but considering the e-book is intended as a cross-promotion with the film, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s sad that it doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t even include previews from the film.</blockquote></p>
<p>Wouldn't it be great if there was tighter integration of all multimedia assets? But sometimes, actually most of the time, I would rather read a regular book made of high quality paper with nothing but beautiful typography to stimulate my imagination of a different world.</p>
