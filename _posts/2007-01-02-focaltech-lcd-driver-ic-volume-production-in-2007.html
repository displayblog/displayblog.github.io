<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/NewsShow/NewsSearch.asp?DocID=PB000000000000000000000000002198&amp;query=LCD">DigiTimes</a>: FocalTech Systems, a new semiconductor design firm established by a Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) marketing VP, will begin volume production of LCD driver ICs in the first half of 2007.</p>
<p>Design focus will be on audio/video IC and driver ICs for digital TVs. The company's LCD driver IC solution will incorporate both source and gate driver ICs onto a single-chip solution and will support LCDs in small sizes ranging from 1.6" to 2.5".</p>
<p>The marketing VP from TSMC is Genda Hu, who was VP of Marketing at TSMC since 2001. Hu established FocalTech in mid-2006 with a capitalization of NT$450 million (about US$13.8 million) from China-based TCL but mostly from the US.</p>
