<p>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is different from the iPad. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/16/technology/personaltech/samsungs-rival-for-the-ipad-loads-on-the-features.html?_r=2&pagewanted=all">David Pogue</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Its message to the tablet-buying world is this: &acirc;&euro;&oelig;O.K., the iPad is great for consuming stuff &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; reading books, watching videos, surfing the Web. But our new Galaxy tablet is also good for creating stuff, for one simple reason: it comes with a pen. See how different we are from Apple?&acirc;&euro;¬ù</blockquote></p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is thinner and lighter than the iPad:</p>
<blockquote><p>When you hold it, you realize why right away: it feels plasticky and insubstantial. The plastic of the back panel is so thin, it could be vinyl; you can feel it flex against the circuit board within. The plastic stylus, which slips into a socket on the lower-right corner, is even airier; it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s so cheap-feeling, it could have fallen out of a cereal box.</blockquote></p>
<p>But the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is not better than the iPad:</p>
<blockquote><p>But the Galaxy Note 10.1 demonstrates that superior specs, more impressive hardware and a much longer list of features don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t necessarily add up to a superior product. Sometimes restraint is just as important as exuberance.</blockquote></p>
<p>A pixel format of 1280x800 on a 10.1-inch LCD, good for a resolution of 149.45 ppi. This for the same price as a 264-ppi 2048x1536 9.7-inch iPad? You've got to be kidding.</p>

<blockquote><p>Well, it's got one. That's about the most positive thing I can say about the screen.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote><p>The screen is also a disappointment&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it's bright and has good color and viewing angles, but a 1280x800 screen in a $500 tablet is a definite strike when other tablets in the same price range are offering 1920x1200 (in the case of ASUS' Transformer Pad Infinity) or 2048x1536 (Apple's newest iPad). It's a perfectly serviceable screen, but that's the nicest adjective it elicits.</blockquote></p>
