<p>Verizon's FIOS is the only fiber-to-the-home service that I know of in the US. Symmetrical 35Mbps means you get downloads and uploads at 35Mbps. Of course, you'll need to pay: US$90 per month with a "Prime" triple-play bundle that includes TV, Internet and phone.</p>
<p><strong>FAST UPLOADS:</strong> Why is there such a thing as a triple-play bundle? Content is content. I would think all you need is a proper UI to access TV, Internet and phone with a single data connection. Nonetheless, sites like Vimeo and YouTube should be happy: content providers can upload faster than they've ever been able to. ETF is $360, so make sure you are committed.&Acirc;&nbsp;Source: <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-verizon-fios-bundles-deliver-unprecedented-two-way-fast-internet-speeds-and-more-high-def-tv-choices-81956622.html">PR Newswire</a> via <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/18/verizon-unveils-new-fios-bundles-with-symmetrical-35mbps-pipes/">Engadget</a></p>
