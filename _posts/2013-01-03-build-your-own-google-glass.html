<p>Rod Furlan, <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/hands-on/build-your-own-google-glass">IEEE Spectrum</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The key insight I had while wearing my own version of Google Glass is that the true value of wearable point-of-view computing will not be in the initial goal of supporting augmented reality, which simply overlays information about the scene before the user. Instead, the greatest value will be in second-generation applications that provide total recall and augmented cognition. Imagine being able to call up (and share) everything you have ever seen, or read the transcripts for every conversation you ever had, alongside the names and faces of everyone you ever met.</blockquote></p>
<p>If only Google Glass didn't look so geeky...</p>
