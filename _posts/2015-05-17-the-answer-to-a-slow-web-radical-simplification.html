<p><a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2015/05/tools_dont_solv.html">Peter-Paul Koch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The solution is simple: ditch the tools. All of them. (No, I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m not being particularly subtle here.) Teach the newbies proper web development. That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s it, really.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The web&acirc;&euro;&trade;s answer to the native challenge should be radical simplification, not even more tools.</blockquote></p>
<p>There <em>are</em> a lot of tools &mdash; back-end and front-end development tools &mdash; out there. I don't know most of them, but I do know this: what you see on a webpage is a fraction of what's going on in the background.</p>
<p>DISPLAYBLOG is quite simple, a result of stripping away almost everything you'd consider standard on a website: about me page, contact page, categories, dates, archive, blogroll, advertisements (I do have a support link at the bottom), etc. I'd call that radical simplification, and it loads quickly, because there is nothing but content and a bit of CSS and fonts to load. But in the background it is built on a content management system called WordPress, which requires PHP and MySQL running a web server like Apache.</p>
<p>I don't think I need all of that, so I've been looking for an even more radically simple solution, and I think I've found one: <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. We'll see what happens.</p>
