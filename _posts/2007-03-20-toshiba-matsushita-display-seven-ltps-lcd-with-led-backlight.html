<p>Toshiba Matsushita Display (TMD) announced on March 20, seven new LCDs with LED backlights geared for notebook PCs. The LED backlight provides a low-profile, lightweight and low-power consumption. TMD is focused on high-end displays using low-temperature poly-silicon (LTPS) technology and was the first to commercialize a LED-backlit 11.1" with a pixel format of 1366 x 768 in October 2005. That went into Sony's ultra-portable TX series notebook PC.</p>

<p>The LED backlight is Mercury-free and RoHS compliant in addition to having lower operating voltages and increased durability against impacts and vibration. The glass used in the new LCDs are just 0.3mm thick. The 10.4" 1024 x 768 LCD panel is just 120g while the 12.1" 1024 x 768 LCD is just 135g. Here are the specifications:</p>
<p>8.9": 1280 x 768, 130g, 200cd/m2, 2.9W<br />
10.4": 1024 x 768, 120g, 240cd/m2, 2.4W<br />
10.6": 1280 x 768, 150g, 300cd/m2, 2.8W<br />
11.1": 1366 x 768, 146g, 240cd/m2, 3.7W<br />
12.1": 1024 x 768, 135g, 300cd/m2, 3.1W<br />
12.1": 1280 x 800, 183g, 300cd/m2, 3.5W<br />
13.3": 1280 x 800, 225g, 300cd/m2, 4.0W</p>
<p>Most likely the LED used in these LCD panels are White LEDs that use a blue chip and yellow phosphor. The color gamut is not improved but is also not degraded from that of normal CCFL-based backlights. The cost is a factor and notebook PCs incorporating these LED-backlit panels will most likely be slightly higher in price than your normal units.</p>
<p>Of course, I would be very surprised (pleasantly!) if Apple comes out with the 13.3" MacBook sporting the 13.3" TMD LED-backlit LCD panel. Imagine a thinner, lighter and longer-lasting MacBook. I would pay exactly $1099 for the base model. Technology gets cheaper by the day. I'm so glad.</p>
