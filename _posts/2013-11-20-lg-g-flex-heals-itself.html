<p>Check out <a href="http://youtu.be/Z-W66HINFLg">Marques Brownlee's YouTube video showing the LG G Flex's healing capability</a>. Here is LG's claim:</p>
<blockquote><p>LG G Flex id designed to recover from light scratches on its back cover within minutes thanks to the application of 'Self Healing' technology.</blockquote></p>
<p>Light scratches are a thing of the past, and you can even accelerate the healing by warming up the LG G Flex (no microwaves). Nifty.</p>
