<p><a href="http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2010/12/10/lgs-wallet-friendly-android-powered-optimus-one-breaks-2-million-sales/">MobileCrunch</a>: The budget-oriented LG Optimus One Android smartphone sold two million in just 65 days. Personally, I didn't think budget and smartphone would go together. I was wrong. I should have known better: Apple prices previous generation iPhones at US$99.</p>
