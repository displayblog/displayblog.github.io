<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/13/5206170/samsung-ativ-book-9-plus-review">David Pierce, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Samsung and fabulous excess get along beautifully, and nowhere is that more clear than on the Book 9 Plus&acirc;&euro;&trade; 13.3-inch, 3200 x 1800 display. The screen is high-res and incredibly beautiful, with vibrant colors, fantastic touch response, and nearly perfect viewing angles. But it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s telling that the screen is set by default to 1920 x 1080: when you crank its resolution all the way up, nearly everything about Windows becomes small enough to make you squint 3 inches from the screen in order to use the computer. It even warns you: "Screen resolution is very high. Double click here to change it."</p>
<p>Having all the extra pixels makes even the "low" 1080p resolution look better than ever, though, with crisper text and more detailed images. Just like with <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/30/5044874/13-inch-macbook-pro-with-retina-display-review-2013">the MacBook Pro with Retina Display</a>, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s probably a bad idea to use this screen to its fullest extent, but it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a great display no matter how you slice it. </blockquote></p>
<p>A 3200x1800 native pixel format LCD used with a 1920x1080 virtual pixel format setting shouldn't be all that great. What should be great is a 3840x2160 native pixel format used with a 1920x1080 virtual pixel format; each virtual pixel uses 2x2 native pixels. I'm stubbornly waiting for a 17-inch MacBook Pro with 4096x2160 or 4K.</p>
