<p>For almost anything interesting coming out of CES The Verge is it. But CES is already slowing down and was a bit slower than <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2013/01/08/ces-2013-day-1/">Day 1</a>.</p>
<p><em>TV</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3851196/panasonic-shows-off-56-inch-4k-oled-tv-at-ces">The Verge</a>: I guess I was wrong, Panasonic isn't focused only on making blacks blacker for its plasma TVs. Panasonic showed off a 56-inch 4K OLED TV prototype. And a 20-inch Windows 8 4K tablet. Speaking of 56-inch 4K OLED TVs, Sony showcased one too (Source: <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3851308/sony-56-inch-4k-oled-tv-hands-on-look">The Verge</a>).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3851310/samsung-curved-oled-tv">The Verge</a>: Samsung announced the world's first curved 55-inch OLED TV. So did LG, with its EA9800 55-inch curved OLED TV (Source: <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3852438/battle-of-the-curved-oled-tvs-lg-matches-samsung-oled-curved-tv">The Verge</a>). Curved? When you're watching these curved OLED TVs from far back enough the curviness doesn't do anything.</p>
<p><em>Smartphone</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3853370/lenovos-5-5-inch-ideaphone-k900-dual-core-intel">The Verge</a>: The Lenovo IdeaPhone K900 is a 5.5-inch 1920x1080 Jelly Bean smartphone sporting a Intel's 2GHz dual-core Atom.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3849604/zte-joins-5-inch-1080p-smartphone-party-with-grand-s">The Verge</a>: Everyone, well not <em>everyone</em>, has a 5-inch 1920x1080 smartphone. The ZTE Grand S is yet another one, running Jelly Bean.</p>
