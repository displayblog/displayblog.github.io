<blockquote><p>Appearing on CNN&acirc;&euro;&trade;s &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Parker Spitzer&acirc;&euro; program last week, he said that people who don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t like Google&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Street View cars taking pictures of their homes and businesses &acirc;&euro;&oelig;can just move&acirc;&euro; afterward to protect their privacy.</blockquote></p>
