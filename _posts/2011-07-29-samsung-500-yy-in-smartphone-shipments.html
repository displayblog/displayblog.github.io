<p><a href="http://www.abiresearch.com/press/3740-Samsung&acirc;&euro;&trade;s+Q2+Smartphone+Growth+Shows+that+the+Race+Is+Its+to+Lose">ABI Research</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Driven by the added distribution muscle of Verizon Wireless and China&acirc;&euro;&trade;s growing appetite for premium smartphones, Apple posted record shipments in Q2 of 20.3 million to become the top smartphone OEM after only four years in the business. Right on the heels of Apple, Samsung had an amazing Q2 with approximately 19 million smartphone shipments and over five million Galaxy S II shipments in its first 85 days.</blockquote></p>
<p>Samsung is growing its smartphone business significantly faster than Apple. The best-selling Galaxy S II will be hitting U.S. shores in August. And just one month later, most are expecting the next iPhone to be announced by Apple. It'll be exciting for folks in the market for a new smartphone in the next couple of months.</p>
