<p>The iPhone without the phone is the iPod touch, isn't it? Well not quite. The display is different, the ID is too and then there's the low-quality camera on the back. But more importantly even if you strip out the phone part of the iPhone a big piece missing on the iPod touch is the 3G connection, the data connection.</p>
<p>Why doesn't the iPod touch have 3G?</p>
<p>I would think the iPod touch would be even more popular than it is if it had 3G and offered data plans like the ones we find on the iPad in the US: US$14.99 for 250MB or $25 for 2GB. Month-to-month without a contract or subscription. With iOS 4.x the iPod touch has multitasking. A future Skype with voice-over-3G and in the background will be a perfect way to get almost everything you'd want from the iPhone at a much lower cost.</p>
<p>Suggestions to Apple: don't waste money on a different ID. Keep the ID the same on the iPhone as well as the iPod touch. Make the only difference be the baseband chips: exists on the iPhone, doesn't on the iPod touch. Ah, you're worried about the price difference? Sell the iPhone unlocked so it doesn't <em>seem</em> like the iPod touch is more expensive when compared to a subsidized $199 iPhone price.</p>
<p>The future is data and data networks. Voice is just data. I don't think we'll need voice networks anymore since voice will be piped through data networks. So give me my iPod touch with 3G. Please.</p>
