<p>The 971P is a 19" LCD monitor targeted toward the commercial markets. The LCD monitor has a unique feature: an asymmetric stand with a triple hinge that allows for 180 degree rotation and 65 degree back-to-front tilting. This flexibility allows for many different installations and helps to improve workstation ergonomics.</p>

<p>For those that require the monitor to be a bit more flexible than the limited rotation and tilt features found in most, the Samsung 971P is very much welcome. I hope companies continue to bring forth designs that do not merely just look good but helps the user use it well.</p>
