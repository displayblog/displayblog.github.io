<p>Fabricating a high-resolution AMOLED is not easy using today's technology. Samsung is currently using Fine-Metal-Mask (FMM) which uses a Shadow Mask and is actually a very expensive method but up till now it's been the only available method for AMOLEDs. It limits the resolution to 200ppi as it has a printing accuracy of about 15 micro meters (this means that a 7" Super AMOLED HD is possible in the current technology). </p><br />

<p>Most likely a RGB stripe sub-pixel OLED with 1280x720 pixels will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to pack into a 4.x-inch display with current OLED manufacturing technology. According to <a href="http://www.etnews.com/news/detail.html?id=201108090209&amp;portal=001_00001">ETNews</a> (Korean), Samsung Mobile Display will bring to market a 4.5-inch HD-class AMOLED with a pixel format of 1280x720 using Nouvoyance PenTile Matrix sub-pixel technology. Samsung will use the so-called Super AMOLE HD display in two class-leading 1.5GHz dual-core CPU equipped LTE smartphones in 2011.</p></p>
