<p><a href="http://www.macrumors.com/c.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fpaidcontent.co.uk%2Farticle%2F419-three-orange-t-mobile-launch-ipad-sales-in-uk-same-price-different-data%2F&t=1291395602">paidContent:UK</a> &rarr; <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2010/12/03/uk-carriers-launch-subsidized-ipad-sales-with-two-year-data-contracts/">MacRumors</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Orange, Three and T-Mobile have all rolled out the subsidized sales today, offering the 16 GB Wi-Fi + 3G iPad model for &Acirc;&pound;199 with a two-year data contract in the range of &Acirc;&pound;25 per month. Orange and Three are also offering subsidized 32 GB and 64 GB models at &Acirc;&pound;249 and &Acirc;&pound;349 respectively.</blockquote></p>
<p>Three's 10GB per month for just &Acirc;&pound;15 sounds fantastic. I was thinking why the iPad in its home country doesn't have subsidized pricing. Instead of not having subsidized pricing we have the freedom to turn on/off the 3G data service anytime and as often as we'd like. Nonetheless, I'd like the option to choose between the two: less price or more freedom.</p>
