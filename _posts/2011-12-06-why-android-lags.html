<p><a href="http://www.redmondpie.com/heres-why-androids-ui-will-never-be-as-smooth-as-ios-or-windows-phone-7/">Awais Imran, Redmond Pie</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>That</em> has been answered by Andrew Munn &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; software engineering student, ex-intern at Google and future intern with Windows Phone 7 team at Microsoft &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; who states that UI rendering processes in iOS occur with dedicated threads with <em>real-time priority</em> whereas on Android, UI rendering processes occur along with the main thread with normal priority. Whenever an iOS devices detects touch, it stops other processes and focuses all attention to rendering the UI. Android devices <em>don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t</em> do this, instead general processing and UI rendering occurs concurrently which results in choppy UI.</blockquote></p>
