<p><a href="http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/business/T120107003536.htm">The Yomiuri Shimbun</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The company said it would continue its sales, research and development of organic EL panels for monitors used by broadcasting companies and other corporate clients, but will withdraw from the market for home-use models of organic TVs.</blockquote></p>
<p>What timing. Just as LG and Samsung prepares to show off their 55-inch OLED TVs.</p>
