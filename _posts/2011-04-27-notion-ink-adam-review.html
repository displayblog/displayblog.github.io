<blockquote><p>Not only do you have to affix an (included) screen protector to achieve the matte effect, but the Adam's viewing angles are terrible. Approach it from any angle but head-on and either the whites or blacks wash out, and if you tilt it to the left everything begins to turn a sickly yellow. The colors are also a bit washed out, and if you're a fan of deep, inky blacks you'd best look somewhere else, as the best the Adam can do is a shade of noisy purple. Moreover, the matte screen protector is fairly thick and we suspect it may be to blame for making the tablet's capacitive digitizer less effective than it should be, as it often felt like we had to press with a little bit of effort to get the Adam to respond to our touch. All that said, the Pixel Qi's reflective mode most certainly does work, and it does its job well, saving hours of additional battery life and making the screen quite viewable outdoors. The question is whether that's worth all the other tradeoffs.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/07/01/pixel-qi-10-1-inch-netbook-lcd-panel-available-now/">I wrote back in July 2010</a> with much excitement about the 3Qi LCD by Pixel Qi:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pixel Qi&acirc;&euro;&trade;s 3qi is a fantastic technology that allows full-color dis&Acirc;&shy;plays that also can be a reflective display that sips tiny bits of power good enough to be used as an ebook display. It can even be seen in direct sunlight and that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not just marketing speak.</blockquote></p>
<p>Yes, the unique reflective mode works as promised. But the regular transmissive mode with full color has terrible viewing angles. A matte screen protector film? How about a screen that's matte, without the film?</p>
<p>Poor touch response will kill any tablet experience, including the Adam, regardless of how much power the Pixel Qi display saves. If reading is your pleasure then there are other more capable products like the Amazon Kindle. In regards to the Pixel Qi 3Qi display and the Notion Ink Adam, I'm surprised to be disappointed.</p>
