Sony wants a piece of the market in between compacts and full-blown DSLRs. That piece of the market is currently dominated by the Micro Four Thirds system with exciting models from Olympus and Panasonic. Here come Sony's NEX3 and NEX5 compact DSLRs and their preliminary specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>NEX3: 14.2MP APS-C CMOS image sensor with ISO 200-12800, Contrast 25-point AF, Memory Stick/SDXC, 720/30p video capture, articulating 2.95-inch TFT LCD, &acirc;&sbquo;&not;250 (about US$320).</li>
<li>NEX5: Same as NEX3 except for AVCHD 1080i video capture, &acirc;&sbquo;&not;350 (about US$450).</li><br />
</ul><br />
The 16mm f2.8 lens is &acirc;&sbquo;&not;250. Availability is in June. The 18-55mm f3.5-5.6 optically stabilized lens you see above is massive and will probably be a major turnoff for most who are interested in the NEX3 or NEX5. The 16mm "pancake" would probably be the default and most popular choice. The entry price for a compact APS-C DSLR from Sony is $640. Not too bad at all and potentially very bad news for the folks in the Micro Four Thirds camp.
