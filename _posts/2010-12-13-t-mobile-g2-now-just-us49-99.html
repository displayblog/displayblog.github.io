<p><a href="http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/Phones/cell-phone-detail.aspx?cell-phone=T-Mobile-G2-with-Google">T-Mobile</a>: Before <em>the</em> Google phone v.2, that would be the Nexus S, becomes available, T-Mobile wants to move its G2 and has slashed the price to just $49.99. With a new two-year agreement, of course.</p>
