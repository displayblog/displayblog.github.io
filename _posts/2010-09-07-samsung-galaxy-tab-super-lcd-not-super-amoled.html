<p>Samsung's Galaxy line of smartphones all use the well-received Super AMOLED. You would think the new Galaxy Tab would too, but then you'd be wrong. The Galaxy Tab uses a Super TFT. Why? Lower power consumption and lower manufacturing costs.</p>
<p>This is big. Samsung is by far the largest promoter of OLED technology and it seems OLED will be relegated to only small sizes good for gadgets like smartphones, for the time being.
