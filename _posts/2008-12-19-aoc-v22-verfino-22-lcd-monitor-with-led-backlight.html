<p><img class="size-full wp-image-3500 aligncenter" title="aoc_v22_verfino" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/aoc_v22_verfino.jpg" alt="aoc_v22_verfino" width="500" height="703" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/12/19/aoc-takes-wraps-off-of-22-inch-led-backlit-v22-display/">Engadget</a>: The AOC V22 Verfino is a fine-looking LCD monitor. It sports a TN (Twisted Nematic) 22" TFT LCD featuring a pixel format of 1680x1050. TN technology limits the viewing angles (160/160) but is ultra-fast with a 2ms response time. Limited viewing angles are not too important unless you need high color fidelity at off axis viewing and if you are thinking of pivoting a monitor in portrait mode. I have HP's w2408h monitors and they are great when used in landscape mode. In portrait mode, pictures and text is not so great. There seems to be some banding of colors and blurring of text. If you require very good viewing angles you should look for LCDs that incorporate VA (PVA-Samsung, ASV-Sharp, MVA-AU Optronics, Chi Mei Optoelectronics) or IPS (LG Display, IPS Alpha) LCD panels.</p></p>
<p>Brightness at 280 cd/m2 is bright enough for a monitor. It could be slightly brighter, but it is not necessary since you are fairly close to it. The V22 Verfino seems to have a built-in microphone and a webcam on top. The little dot next to the webcam might instead be an ambient light sensor. I am not sure.</p></p>
<p>I don't put too much importance into dynamic contrast ratio unless there are two technologies involved: a LED backlight and local dimming. Well, the V22 Verfino does have a LED backlight. I am not sure if local dimming technology is incorporated into the V22 Verfino but I will guess that AOC is doing it. The 100,000:1 figure for its dynamic contrast ratio is very high and will probably require making use of local dimming technology. Just a guess.</p>
<p>The V22 Verfino would have been near perfect if it featured a 1920x1200 pixel format instead of 1680x1050. There might be ways to watch 1080p HD content on the V22 Verfino but based on the pixel format you're limited to 720p HD.</p>
<p>Bottomline: The V22 Verfino is a 22" LCD monitor that incorporates a LED backlight and improves the dynamic contrast ratio to unheard levels for a LCD monitor: 100,000:1. Watching HD video content will be better than most other LCD monitors with an ultra-fast 2ms response time in addition to the excellent contrast ratio. Just make sure you're right in the middle of the screen.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> Vishnu, who seems to be from AOC, has stated in the comment area that the little dot next to the webcam is not a light sensor but a microphone. Thanks vishnu!</p>
