<blockquote><p>My first thought was to laugh, but, hey, at this point, let&acirc;&euro;&trade;s give Google the benefit of the doubt and hope these things are actually useful and cool. We&acirc;&euro;&trade;re not going to be tapping on 3 to 5 inch pieces of glass for the entire future of mobile computing. Something&acirc;&euro;&trade;s got to come next. Maybe heads-up displays are next.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote><p>The heads up display (HUD) is only for one eye and on the side. It is not transparent nor does it have dual 3D configurations, as previously speculated.</blockquote></p>

<p><em>Update 2012.02.23:</em> Google should consider using the <a href="http://www.lumus-optical.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=9&Itemid=15">Lumus OE-32 optical engine</a>.</p>
