  a white Adamo. There's also a black one (after the jump). Most of the ports are

  connection. The Adamo is THINNER than <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=apple\">Apple</a>'s

<p style="text-align: left;">The pictures are courtesy of bub.blicio.us and Brian Solis has kindly uploaded <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/briansolis/sets/72157612318638931/detail/">a bunch of pictures up on Flickr</a>. I like the minimalist design, the backlit keyboard (but not the additional keys on the right) and that the right side of the Adamo is clear (except for little connector). But I don't think it was the best idea to have a cheap-looking thing light up right in the middle. Quite cheesy. Make the Dell logo light up, but barely instead.</p></p>
