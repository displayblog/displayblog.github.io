<p>Andrew Kim on <a href="http://designfabulous.blogspot.com/2010/11/seoul-8-coex-galaxy-tab-and-more.html">Design Fabulous</a> regarding the Samsung Galaxy Tab:</p>
<blockquote><p>- The perfect size for reading a book. But if reading books is your key need, get a Kindle.<br />
- Too small for comfortable web browsing and reading magazines.<br />
- It's too large to carry without a bag and if you're going to carry it in a bag, wouldn't you want something larger?<br />
- Some people say that the 9.7" display is too large on the iPad. However 7" definitely not the right size. Maybe 9" is.</blockquote></p>
<p>Just like Apple has stuck to 3.5 inches for all four iterations of its iPhone, I think the company will stick to 9.7 inches for its iPad for some time. I am looking forward to when Apple announces the next-generation iPad.</p>
