excerpt: '<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dell">Dell</a>
  is planning to transition all of its notebook PC LCDs from CCFL backlight technology
  to <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=backlight">LED backlight</a>.
  Why? LED has many advantages over CCFL. First off, LED consumes less energy than
  CCFL. And this is a good thing in light of our current energy situation. Not only
  that, less energy consumption will mean less out-of-pocket for electricity bills
  when you''re computing from home. Less energy consumption also means you can compute
  for longer durations since the battery will last longer, assuming the same battery
  is used. The second advantage is size. LED backlights allow for thinner profiles
  than CCFL backlights. Assuming thinner equals less weight, you''ll be using less
  energy to carry the thing around. Another benefit of LED technology is that it is
  more rugged than CCFL. I don''t recall hearing any news about broken CCFLs, but
  it is good to know that LEDs will be even tougher. With the new <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=rgb-led-backlight">RGB
  LED backlight</a>s, you can expect roughly a 100% NTSC color gamut as well.
  Typical color gamuts on notebook PCs are at best 72% NTSC and generally much less
  than that. Finally, mercury is eliminated, which is an important step toward becoming
  more environmentally friendly. '

<p>According to Dell, 67% of the company's Latitude E-series notebook PCs will sport a LED backlight as a standard feature. The models include the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/08/15/dell-e4200-121-notebook-pc/">Latitude E4200</a>, E4300, E6400, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/07/29/dell-e-6400-atg-mil-810f-compliant-rugged-notebook-pc/">E6400 ATG</a>, and E6500. Dell's Precision M2400 and M4400 will also have the LED backlight. It only gets better. By the end of 2009, 80% of all Dell's notebook PCs will sport LED backlights and by 2010 the company will reach 100%.</p>
<p>Dell is reporting a 43% reduction of power consumption at maximum brightness for a 15"-class LCD. Across millions of notebook PCs that's a tremendous amount of power savings and should bode well to alleviate the energy crisis. As mentioned above, you'll be able to use your notebook PC for many more hours and up to 24 hours in some cases. Dell is also planning to shift to LED backlight technology for LCD monitor applications in the "not-too-distant future" according to Michael Murphy, Dell's Senior Manger of Worldwide Environmental Affairs.</p>
