<p>The Acer Aspire S3 is a rather nice looking 13.3-inch ultrabook. The chassis is made of an aluminum magnesium alloy and it's thin, at 13 mm, and light, at 1.4 kg.</p>
<p>Comparison to the 13.3-inch MacBook Air is inevitable, so I'll get right to it. At its thickest point the MBA is 17 mm and weighs 1.35 kg. So the S3 is thinner, by 4 mm, but heavier, by 0.05 kg.</p>
<p>CPU choices are Intel Core i3, i5, and i7; the MBA does not have an i3 option. A 240GB SSD is optional, but with it battery life goes up to seven hours, matching the MBA.</p>
<p>Now the bad part: the 13.3-inch LCD on the S3 sports a 1366x768 pixel format. Right here, the S3 fails to meet the standard set by the 13.3-inch MacBook Air, which packs 1440x900 pixels.</p>
<p>Official pricing has not been determined, but Acer wants to price it between &euro;799 and &euro;1,199. The MBA with an i5 CPU and a 128GB SSD starts at US$1299, or about &euro;920 as of this writing. At any price near the MBA the S3 will be a tough sell considering the starting price will likely include an i3 CPU, a 320GB hard drive, and a pixel-starved 13.3-inch LCD.</p>
