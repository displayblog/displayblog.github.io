<p>I was going through my email this morning and in came an email flyer from Tiger Direct. I glanced at some of the smaller sized LCD monitors and came up to the Scepter 24". The price is quite unbelievable for a 24". For those that simply need the number of pixels (1920 x 1200) and do not mind the limited viewing angles, the price of $299.99 is a great deal. The 160/160 viewing angles suggest that this is using a TN LCD panel, which is not the greatest, but for just $300, the performance hit might just be swallowable considering the price. TN panels generally have faster response times and the Scepter x24wg-Naga delivers with a quick 2ms. If you like playing games on the PC and are on a budget, this might be a good choice.</p>
