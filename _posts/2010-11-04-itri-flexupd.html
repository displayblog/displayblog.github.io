<p><img src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/ITRI_FlexUPD.jpg" alt="" title="ITRI_FlexUPD" width="480" height="406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13902" /></p>
<p>Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) has won the Overall Gold <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703860104575507662614225090.html">2010 Wall Street Journal Technology Innovation Award</a> for its FlexUPD. The paper-thin, low-cost and flexible flat display allows for two-sided surface visibility and can be manufactured inexpensively. The FlexUPD is technologically compatible with current LCD production lines. Only the de-bonding equipment needs to be added to LCD manufacturing facilities for FlexUPD.</p>
<p>The photo above is a 6-inch color flexible AMOLED e-paper made with FlexUPD technology. The OLED display is just 0.1mm thick with a folding radius of 5cm or less. Brightness is 150 cd/m2. The flexible e-paper can be scrolled up to 15,000 times.</p>

<p>What FlexUPD enables is the removal of the flexible portion of the panel after all of the typical processing has been completed on a glass substrate. A foldable Bluetooth OLED keyboard would be something that would fill a need right now!</p>
