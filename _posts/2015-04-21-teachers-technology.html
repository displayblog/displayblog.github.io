<p><a href="https://medium.com/bright/ipads-teachers-e51896af3930">Peg Tyre</a> shares four observations about blended learning:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no magic device that helps kids learn more.</li>
<li>For the most part, education software is worse than you think.</li>
<li>Tech-assisted personalized learning is not going to be the answer for every kid.</li>
<li>Technology-assisted personalized learning is not going to get rid of a central problem in American schooling: We are not training and retaining nearly enough great teachers.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Great teaching is not easy:</p>
<blockquote><p>Master teachers are something like NBA stars; they have a seemingly endless supply of tiny, almost gestural moves that can have a big impact on a kid&acirc;&euro;&trade;s cognition. They make split-second choices about how to introduce new ideas, speak in a way that resonates, order concepts for maximum comprehension, and reinforce ideas and skills. Those choices depend on the teacher&acirc;&euro;&trade;s reading of the subtleties of a specific situation.</blockquote></p>
<p>Just like NBA stars, few are master teachers; we need more.</p>
