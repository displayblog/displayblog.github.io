<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/lg-star/preview/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The 800 x 480 panel on this phone is rather gorgeous. We can tell from its imperfect blacks that it's not an AMOLED display, but it also exhibits viewing angles that are distinctly superior to your run-of-the-mill LCD. Whatever it is, it delivers a lucid and vibrant picture. The glass covering it is flat -- none of that fancy Nexus S stuff -- but slopes off at the sides to soften the edges and improve ergonomics slightly.</blockquote></p>
<p>The LG Star probably has an IPS LCD.</p>
