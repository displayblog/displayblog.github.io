<p>Yours truly quoted, <a href="http://my.opera.com/chooseopera/blog/2011/09/27/living-mobile-in-south-korea">Anna Rohleder at Opera News</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Folks have their phones with them at all times. And because of the way they move around using a lot of public transportation, a good percentage actually hold their phones." Being so visible to others, the mobile then also becomes an object to be decorated for display. He continues: "From young to not so young, people go beyond just putting a case on their phones. There are stickers, photo stickers, extensions with cute things on them or lights sometimes."</blockquote></p>
<p>In South Korea the 'handphone' is essential.</p>
