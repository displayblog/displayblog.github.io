<p><a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/7519/apple-ipad-mini-with-retina-display-reviewed/3">Anand Lal Shimpi, AnandTech</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The iPad mini with Retina Display has the same color gamut as the standard iPad mini, which is narrower than the iPad Air and less than the sRGB coverage we normally look for.</blockquote></p>
<p>Wasn't expecting this; if sRGB &mdash; and color overall &mdash; is important to you, get the iPad Air.</p>
