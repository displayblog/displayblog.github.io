<blockquote><p>Amazon has settled on a Taiwan-based supply chain for its tablets to be launched in the third quarter of 2011, with TFT-LCD panel maker Chunghwa Picture Tubes (CPT) to supply touch sensors for use in 7-inch G/G (Glass on Glass) touch panels, according to supply chain makers.</blockquote></p>
<p>Amazon's tablet is rumored to sport E Ink's Hydis-developed fringe field switching (FFS) TFT LCD, a wide-viewing display technology that is as good as IPS. To make use of CPT's Gen. 6 TFT LCD line, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/07/20/e-ink-and-chunghwa-picture-tubes-form-strategic-alliance/">E Ink will soon own a piece of CPT</a>.</p>
