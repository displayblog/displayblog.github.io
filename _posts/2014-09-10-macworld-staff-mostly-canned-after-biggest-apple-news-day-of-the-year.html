<p>Sam Biddle, <a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/macworld-staff-canned-after-biggest-apple-news-day-of-t-1633040642/+sambiddle">Valleywag</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The economic reality of running a print publication dedicated to Apple news is a total disaster, of course &mdash; blogs run a monopoly on that, and have for years. But squeezing one last grueling day of marathon iPhone coverage out of a team you're on the verge of firing is not cool.</blockquote></p>
