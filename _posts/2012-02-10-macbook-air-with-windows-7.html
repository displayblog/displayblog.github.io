<blockquote><p>What is clear is that there is not yet a perfect ultrabook for Windows 7 users &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; one with the perfect balance of features and value. Obviously, Apple is never going to make that machine, but in many ways its hardware enables the best Windows experience right now, even if it hasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t been tweaked for power efficiency and costs too much for the tradeoffs involved.</blockquote></p>
