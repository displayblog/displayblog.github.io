<p>I'm not a lawyer but this doesn't seem right. Between September 2008 and October 2009 <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=sprint&amp;sa=Search#1313">Sprint</a> Nextel gave customer GPS location data more than 8 million times. Sprint clarified stating that huge 8 million is the number of pings. Regardless, I would want that.
