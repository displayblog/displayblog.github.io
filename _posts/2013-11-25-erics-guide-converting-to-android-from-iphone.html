<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/app/basic/stream/z12fjzfxvwnws1e3d23vhni5lybzclmaq04">Eric Schmidt</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many of my iPhone friends are converting to Android.  The latest high-end phones from Samsung (Galaxy S4), Motorola (Verizon Droid Ultra) and the Nexus 5 (for AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile) have better screens, are faster, and have a much more intuitive interface.  They are a great Christmas present to an iPhone user!</blockquote></p>
<p>I'm sure Eric Schmidt has many friends, and of those many who use iPhones. But to infer a broader trend of iPhone users converting to Android is a market research rookie mistake. Having said that I do have many friends who wish the iPhone had a bigger display.</p>
<p>What would Eric Schmidt know of better screens. I'm assuming he goes by the assumption: Bigger displays are better; more pixels are better. And if that is the case, he is right. Android smartphones have way bigger displays than the 4-inch LCD on the iPhone 5, 5c, and 5s. Some Android smartphones also sport resolutions that are <em>much</em> higher than the 326 ppi found on the latest iPhones.</p>
<p>I wouldn't say the 4-inch LTPS IPS LCD used in the latest iPhones are better than the Samsung Galaxy S4 or the Google Nexus 5, but I don't think you can claim it's the other way either. I'm an iPhone 5 user, but I am itching to get some time on a much larger smartphone like the Sony Xperia Z Ultra. I want to find out for myself if a massive smartphone works for me or not, and why. Any Android users out there (I'm looking at you Eric Schmidt) generous enough to send one to me as a Christmas present?</p>
