<p><a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2010/11/19/apple-to-offer-free-mobileme-service-to-some-ios-users/">MacRumors</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>New evidence uncovered in recent iOS 4.2 builds and the iOS 4.2.1 golden master seed is suggesting, however, that Apple will be offering a free MobileMe tier to users. The evidence comes in the form of a new private framework known as AppleAccounts.framework that includes a series of device-specific error messages referring to free MobileMe accounts.</blockquote></p>
<p>I used to dabble in programming a long time ago, so I won't pretend to know what this means. All that I know is that Apple needs to offer a compelling cloud-based syncing iOS platform and for free, to compete against Google and what they have done with Android. Android is way ahead of iOS when it comes to cloud-syncing and a greatly enhanced free MobileMe will bridge the gap somewhat. I hope the rumor is true because it is about time.</p>
