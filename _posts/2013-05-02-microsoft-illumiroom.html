<p><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/illumiroom/">Microsoft Research</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>IllumiRoom uses a Kinect for Windows camera and a projector to blur the lines between on-screen content and the environment we live in allowing us to combine our virtual and physical worlds. For example, our system can change the appearance of the room, induce apparent motion, extend the field of view, and enable entirely new game experiences.</blockquote></p>
<p>Neat idea.</p>
