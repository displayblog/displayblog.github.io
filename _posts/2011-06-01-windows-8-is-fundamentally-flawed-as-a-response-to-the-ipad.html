<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2011/06/windows_8_fundamentally_flawed">John Gruber</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s radical notion is that touchscreen personal computers should make severely different tradeoffs than traditional computers &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; and that you can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t design one system that does it all. Windows 8 is trying to have it all, and I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t think that can be done. You can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t make something conceptually lightweight if it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s carrying 25 years of Windows baggage.</blockquote></p>
<p>I think you <em>can</em> design a single system that works as a touchscreen personal computer and a traditional computer. It's just that the design won't be as crisp, elegant, and lightweight as something that's dedicated to a touchscreen personal computer, like iOS.</p>
<p>Microsoft has a good chance of getting away with a less elegant solution though: <em>via</em> brut force hardware. If the new chips from Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, and Texas Instruments are any indication Microsoft has a lot of CPU power to work with for its Windows 8 tablets. And that means Microsoft can get sloppy and a little bloated with Windows 8 and still sell millions upon millions.</p>
<p>With Windows 8 it be might be a case where good enough is good enough for hundreds of millions of existing Windows users wanting an iPad-like tablet experience. But I'm guessing a lot of them have already bought an iPad.</p>
