<p>Cat Griffin, Amazon spokesperson, <em>via</em> <a href="http://arstechnica.com/media/news/2011/03/amazon-on-cloud-player-we-dont-need-no-stinkin-licenses.ars">ars technica</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cloud Player is an application that lets customers manage and play their own music. It's like any number of existing media management applications. We do not need a license to make Cloud Player available.</blockquote></p>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote><p>[W]e do not need a license to store music in Cloud Drive. The functionality of saving MP3s to Cloud Drive is the same as if a customer were to save their music to an external hard drive or even iTunes.</blockquote></p>
<p>If I purchase music, store it in the cloud, and listen to it on my computer later on, what's the problem? I love this cloud MP3 player.</p>
