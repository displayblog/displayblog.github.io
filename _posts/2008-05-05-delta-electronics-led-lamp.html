<p>Delta Electronics introduced its LED lamp during the Light+Building 2008 Exhibition in Frankfurt, Germany back in early April. Delta's LED lamp is shaped like a normal compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) and is compatible with the bulb sockets that are used worldwide. There are three versions: 5W, 9W, 12W. According to Delta, the 5W Delta Lamp is equivalent to a 25W incandescent lamp leading to a 80% reduction in power consumption. Thermal dissipation is 25% better than other LED lamps on the market, according to Delta. Thermal management is extremely important as LEDs are somewhat sensitive to high temperatures. LED's life expectancy can be drastically reduced in very high temperatures.</p>

<p>The company is stressing that its LED lamp works extremely well in low temperatures. The Delta LED lamp is six times more efficient compared to CFLs in zero degrees (Celcius) temperatures. You can expect the Delta LED lamp to last 35,000 hours and once it needs to be retired, you don't need to worry as it does not have mercury, as do the CFLs. Delta is forecasting that by July 2008 the luminous efficacy of the LED lamp will reach 70 lumens per watt (lm/w).</p>
<p>Eventually, most lightbulbs will move from incandescent to compact fluorescent to LED. The biggest barrier to more efficient LED bulbs? Price. Currently, a <a href="http://www.ccrane.com/geobulb/index.aspx">8w high-quality LED bulb</a> (similar in brightness to a 60w incandescent bulb) can cost about $120! The price of a 60w incandescent equivalent 13w CFL can cost $2.50. The kicker is that a regular 60w incandescent bulb can be had for just <a href="http://www.bulbs.com/%22Regular%22_(A--Shape)/results.aspx">$0.84</a>. I don't know how much Delta's LED bulb will cost but hopefully when Delta starts volume shipping in July, the cost will be quite a bit lower than $120 per bulb.</p>
