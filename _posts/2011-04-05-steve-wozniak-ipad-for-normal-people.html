<p>Steve Wozniak <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/wozniak-tablets-are-for-normal-people/89147">Cult of Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The tablet is not necessarily for the people in this room. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s for the normal people in the world.</blockquote></p>
<p>Wozniak spoke at a keynote session at Storage Network World in Santa Clara, Calif. Not only is it for normal people in the world, the iPad is for people who have stayed away from computers because they were seen as too difficult to use.</p>
