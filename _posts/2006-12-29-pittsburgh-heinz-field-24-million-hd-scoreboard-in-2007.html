<p><a href="http://www.engadgethd.com/2006/12/28/pittsburghs-heinz-field-to-get-2-4-million-hd-scoreboard-in-20/">Engadget HD</a>, <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06356/748254-53.stm">Post Gazette</a>: Pittsburgh's Heinz Field has a scoreboard that is fit for an upgrade. The scoreboard has a low-tech SD resolution and has been there since 2001. Time to upgrade. Daktronics will be manufacturing the new scoreboard and will be installed in 2007. The new system will focus on improving viewing angles to allow 3600 additional ticket holders to watch the action on the new screen. So, when you buy tickets for the 2007 season, make sure you're not one of 400 that will get stuck at the south end of the stadium with no view of the new HD screen.</p>
