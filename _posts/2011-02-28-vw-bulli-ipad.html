<p><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2011/02/28/volkswagen-bulli-concept-is-a-microbus-redux-for-geneva/">Autoblog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This time it's called the Volkswagen Bulli, and like its 2001 ancestor, this one is designed to carry on the legacy of the brand's famous Microbus. This Geneva concept packs a 113-horsepower electric motor drawing power from a lithium-ion battery pack. At full charge, the Bulli is said to be theoretically good for 186 miles before a recharge. When it's time for more juice, VW says the Bulli can be fully charged in less than an hour.</blockquote></p>
<p>What a cool concept.</p>

<p>And here's something even cooler: the iPad controls the stereo, navigation, communications and HVAC. Of course, the iPad is removable.</p>
