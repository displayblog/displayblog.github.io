<p><a href="http://allthingsd.com/20111109/amazon-has-acquired-yap-the-closest-thing-to-a-siri-clone-it-can-find/">Tricia Duryee, AllThingsD</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most recently, Yap&acirc;&euro;&trade;s servers were being used by Sprint and others to convert voicemails to text. It was being shipped on a majority of Sprint&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Android handsets. Yap also had an iPhone app.</blockquote></p>
<p>I expect a Siri-like Yap to be the voice activated front end to future mobile devices from Amazon.</p>
