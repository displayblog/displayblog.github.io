<p>Acer is in the ultraportable notebook PC bandwagon with its Aspire One, showcased during Computex 2008 in Taipei, Taiwan. The Aspire One sports a 8.9" LCD with a pixel format of 1024 x 600, great for net surfing. It also has integrated WiMax capability so when that gets turned on the world over, you're right there ready to surf the big one. The price of $399 is unofficial but that's quite affordable! The 3-cell battery has 2200mAh of juice so the 6-cell battery should have 4400mAh? That will keep the Aspire One kicking until the entire day is over. Ah one more thing, folks are calling these category of notebook PCs something new: netbooks.</p>
