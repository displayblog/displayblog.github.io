<blockquote><p>Instead of just &acirc;&euro;&oelig;translating&acirc;&euro;¬ù paper charts, for example, chart notes should automatically fill-in preexisting prescription information and past medical history. Providers should be able to instantly send chart-note information in fax referrals to their colleagues. Keeping the doctor&acirc;&euro;&trade;s basic need in mind, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s easy to see that prescribing and making referrals are essential to a patient-visit workflow. But they can only be combined this efficiently on a digital platform. These little features add up to big time savings over paper.</blockquote></p>
