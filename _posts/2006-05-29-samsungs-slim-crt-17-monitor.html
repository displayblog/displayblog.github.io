<p>Let's get this straight: Originally 358mm thick and now 308mm thick. That's still thick. I don't think you can call that thin or slim. It's fat and probably heavy and something that only folks that can't spend $199 on a 17" LCD monitor will want to get. Actually, I take that back. Hardcore gamers might want something like this because they know gaming requires fast screen performance and LCDs are just barely cutting it.</p>
