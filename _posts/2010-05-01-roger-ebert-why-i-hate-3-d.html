<p><a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/237110/page/1">Roger Ebert</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's the waste of a dimension.</li>
<li>It adds nothing to the experience.</li>
<li>It can be a distraction.</li>
<li>It can create nausea and headaches.</li>
<li>Have you noticed that 3-D seems a little dim?</li>
<li>There's money to be made in selling new digital projectors.</li>
<li>Theaters slap on a surcharge of $5 to $7.50 for 3-D.</li>
<li>I cannot imagine a serious drama, such as Up in the Air or The Hurt Locker, in 3-D.</li>
<li>Whenever Hollywood has felt threatened, it has turned to technology: sound, color, widescreen, Cinerama, 3-D, stereophonic sound, and now 3-D again.</li><br />
</ul><br />
The only 3D movie that I've seen is Avatar and I really enjoyed the experience. But I also have read that James Cameron did a superb job in integrating 3D into Avatar, avoiding a lot of the reasons why Ebert hates 3D.</p>
