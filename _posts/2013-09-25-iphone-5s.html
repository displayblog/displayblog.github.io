<p>Two reasons<sup>*</sup> to upgrade from an iPhone 5:</p>
<ol>
<li>The camera, is better in low light, has 10fps burst mode and <a href="http://vimeo.com/75285430">slow-mo video</a>.</li>
<li>Fingerprint reader, for those who hate passcodes as much as leaving their iPhones unlocked.</li><br />
</ol></p>
<p>One reason <em>not</em> to buy: The two reasons mentioned above don't mean much.</p>
<p><sup>*</sup>There are more reasons, but will be invisible for most of us most of the time.</p>
