<p>[ <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/24/technology/justice-department-wants-apple-to-unlock-nine-more-iphones.html">The New York Times</a> ] Eric Lichtblau and Joseph Goldstein:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Justice Department is demanding Apple&rsquo;s help in unlocking at least nine iPhones nationwide in addition to the phone used by one of the San Bernardino, Calif., attackers.</p>
<p>The disclosure appears to buttress the company&rsquo;s concerns that the dispute could pose a threat to encryption safeguards that goes well beyond the single California case.</blockquote></p>
<p>At least nine.</p>
<blockquote><p>And in a note on its website on Monday, Apple said law enforcement agencies nationwide &ldquo;have hundreds of iPhones they want Apple to unlock if the F.B.I. wins this case.&rdquo;</blockquote></p>
