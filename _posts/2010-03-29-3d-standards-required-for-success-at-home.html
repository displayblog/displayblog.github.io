<p>Carolyn Glardina for The Hollywood Reporter in <em><a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i68c9747cd968ca8d5b27fcb8619d8b88">How 'Avatar' changed the rules of deliverables</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>... since the industry began its shift into the digital and stereoscopic 3D realm, a theatrical release now amounts to a large number of film prints as well as multiple versions of digital media with various technical specifications.</blockquote><br />
100 versions of Avatar were created for the December 18 release in 102 countries.&Acirc;&nbsp;There were even three aspect ratios: 2:39:1 (Scope), 1.85:1 (flat) and 1.43:1 (IMAX). If participants in the 3D industry do not come together and forge a single standard for the home I expect success the likes of Avatar in the theater to be elusive, for quite some time.</p>
