<p><strong>Optimistic</strong> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=au+optronics&amp;sa=Search">AU Optronics</a> (AUO) is optimistic about LCD panel demand in the fourth quarter of 2009. The company's chairman shared optimism that lower LCD panel prices will not have much of an impact. According to analysts, LCD panel prices are expected to continue dropping through the first quarter of 2010. KY Lee, AUO's chairman, stated that he does not see any negative factors impacting the overall demand for LCDs in China and North America. He also shared that LCD panel prices will only fall slightly in the fourth quarter.</p>
