<blockquote><p>We're not nearly as impressed with the TN-based screen though. From the ideal viewing angle, it is at best average. Colours are bright and punchy thanks in part to its glossy coating, but this also causes distracting reflections. Black differentiation is poor, meaning you'll miss out on dark detail in films. However, there's no sign of banding, backlighting is even and sharpness good.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the aforementioned ideal viewing angle is very narrow, with contrast and colour shift whether off-axis horizontally or vertically. [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>The capacitive-based multitouch 12-inch 1280x800 TFT LCD false short. Viewing angles need to be exceptional especially with a product that will be used in both portrait and landscape orientations.</p>
