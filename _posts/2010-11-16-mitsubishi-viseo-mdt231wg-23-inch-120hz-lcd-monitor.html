<p><a href="http://en.akihabaranews.com/72412/displays/mitsubishi-introduces-high-end-all-in-one-monitor?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=mitsubishi-introduces-high-end-all-in-one-monitor">Akihabara News</a> &rarr; <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/16/mitsubishi-mdt231wg-monitor-is-23-inches-of-120hz-gaming-goodnes/">Engadget</a>: It has been a long time since Mitsubishi has made a decent monitor. I remember the MultiSync CRT monitors that made use of Sony's flat Trinitron technology. Those were what everyone wanted. After how many years, I don't know, Mitsubishi seems to be making a comeback with its VISEO MDT231WG. It is a 23-inch LCD monitor that sports a 1920x1080 pixel format, 120Hz frequency, 5.5ms response time, 350 cd/m2 brightness, 178-degree viewing angles, 900:1 contrast ratio (static) and to top it all of it is an IPS LCD. Connectivity options include S-Video, component, VGA, DVI-D, HDMI (2) and D5. It will be expensive at around &Acirc;&yen;118,000.</p>
