<p><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-57428643-92/did-apple-settle-on-plan-b-for-the-third-generation-ipad/">Raymond Soneira</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The plan was to use this new technology called IGZO from Sharp&mdash;a lot higher electron mobility that allows them to make the transistors a lot smaller and the circuit elements a lot smaller. There's no question that the iPad 3 is Plan B. They pushed amorphous silicon to a higher [pixels per inch] than anybody else. But the light throughput is not good. So it has roughly twice as many LEDs, and they had to get a 70 percent larger battery.</blockquote></p>
<p>I'm curious as to what Apple will do once Sharp volume manufactures IGZO-based 9.7-inch Retina displays. Will Apple equip the new iPad with the improved display mid-cycle? That could happen. <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/5789/the-ipad-24-review-32nm-a5-tested/4">The iPad 2,4 with a 32nm Samsung-built A5 is reported to have better battery life, by a significant margin</a>. If Apple decides to implement "Plan A" later this year we might either see the new iPad's battery life improve quite a bit or have the same battery life with less weight. Either would be good.</p>
