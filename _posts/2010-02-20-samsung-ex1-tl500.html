<p>I personally think it would be best to have a global model number: Samsung's EX1 in Europe is the TL500 in the US. Canon does this too. Nevertheless the EX1 or TL500 was introduced on February 20, 2010 and makes use of a 1/1.7-inch CCD image sensor, which is larger than what is typically found in compact digital cameras. The Schneider KREUZNACH lens is impressive too: 24mm f/1.8, which means it is wide angle and very fast. Samsung claims the sensor and lens combination allow for "better photos in low-light environments" with a max ISO of 3200 combined with a DRIMeIII image processor. Samsung makes use of Dual Image Stabilization technology. I am not sure if that means the TL500 makes use of both optical and in-body digital IS. You can also record video at 640x480 encoded in H.264.</p>
<p>An interesting feature is the articulating 3-inch AMOLED display:</p>
<blockquote><p>Compared to the traditional TFT-LCD found on most digital cameras, the EX1&acirc;&euro;&trade;s AMOLED provides users with a higher contrast ratio, deeper blacks and more accurate, vivid colors, even when viewed from an angle or in direct sunlight.</blockquote><br />
I wonder how you're supposed to take a picture with the display articulated toward the front without an optical viewfinder. Hmm. Although I will get fairly deep into details regarding Samsung's AMOLED displays in a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/02/11/display-showdown-nexus-one-vs-iphone-3gs/">soon-to-be-released Nexus One technical review</a>, just because the colors are more vivid does not necessarily mean more accurate colors, on the contrary, the colors are likely to be quite inaccurate. The claimed higher contrast ratio thanks to deeper blacks is believable but the ability to view the AMOLED in direct sunlight with deep blacks and vivid colors is questionable. Samsung also claims more efficient power consumption but that would only apply when the photographs are generally on the darker side.&Acirc;&nbsp;Design wise, on the front of the TL500 is the text "F1.8" and on the back is "AMOLED". Tacky. Source: <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/1002/10022005samsungex1.asp">DPReview</a></p>
