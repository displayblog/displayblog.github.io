<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2010/11/smartphone-banking-apps-expose-sensitive-customer-data.ars">Ars Technica</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>... at least one Android application, distributed by Wells Fargo, stored an account holder&acirc;&euro;&trade;s username and password on the phone in cleartext.</blockquote></p>
<p>Whatever app you're using from whatever bank don't save your password. In this case a little inconvenience can save a lot of it later on.</p>
