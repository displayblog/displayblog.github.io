<p><strong>Update 2008.10.15 4:39PM PST</strong> I came to the Valley Fair (Westfield) Apple Store in San Jose to check out the new MacBooks but they are nowhere in sight. So I asked someone and the guy told me that, "We had it in stock and before we could set them up for display, they were all sold." So I asked him if there was a line and he replied, "Yup." I guess the new MacBooks and MBPs are popular! Updating from the Apple Store via a 20" iMac. :-)</p>
<p><strong>Original</strong> The new MacBook has a LED backlit LCD, a multitouch glass trackpad, an anluminum unibody enclosure, the mini-DisplayPort connector, and the new integrated NVIDA GeForce 9400M GPU, which is quite a bit faster than the Intel part Apple was using up to now.</p>
<p>Wow, 2 out of 2. First the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/10/14/apple-24-led-cinema-display/">24" LED Cinema Display comes sporting a LED backlight</a>, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/08/08/apple-cinema-displays-with-led-backlight/">just like I thought it would</a>. And now the new MacBook has a LED backlight too. Way back <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/05/24/100-led-backlight-for-macbook-in-2008-not-2009/">on May 24, 2008, I guessed that MacBooks would go LED in 2008</a>, a counter argument to a DigiTimes' report that Kenmos Technology, the Taiwan-based backlight unit (BLU) supplier, stated that Apple's MacBooks would go all LED BLU in 2009. I guessed that it would go 100% LED BLU in 2008. I wish I could have been this lucky with the stock market...</p>
