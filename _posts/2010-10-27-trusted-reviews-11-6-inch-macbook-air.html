<p><a href="http://www.trustedreviews.com/laptops/review/2010/10/27/Apple-MacBook-Air-11-6-inch/p1">Trusted Reviews</a> on the 11.6-inch MacBook Air:</p>
<blockquote><p>The screen didn't make quite as much of an impact as we hoped, looking like a lesser quality panel than those of other MacBooks; contrast, colour saturation, and viewing angles all seemed worse. That said it is still a more than nice display for general use. Moreover it's resolution of 1,366 x 768... is a combination of screen size and resolution that seems to have fallen out of favour so we're glad to see it return. Essentially, to our minds it's the perfect balance of portability and practicality.</blockquote></p>
<p>Can we expect an IPS LCD to show up on a MacBook? I sure hope so.</p>
