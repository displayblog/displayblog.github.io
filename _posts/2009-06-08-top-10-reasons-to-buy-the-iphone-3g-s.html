<p>The iPhone 3G S is the fastest iPhone, yet. I hate stuffing multiple gadgets into my jeans. But it is uncool for a tech guy living in Silicon Valley to carry around a manbag. I've tried and it feels a bit awkward. So far my iPhone has been the best all-in-one pocketable device but with a few areas that needed improvement. The weakest feature of the iPhone 3G is the camera--it sucks. The new iPhone 3G S has a much improved camera and a whole lot more. If you want just one device in your pocket (or purse) that does it all and does it well the iPhone 3G S, in my opinion, is simply the best pocketable do-everything gadget available. Yes, better than the Palm Pre. Here are ten reasons why you should seriously consider getting the iPhone 3GS, in no particular order:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>3.2 Megapixel Camera</strong>: Autofocus. You can also manually focus. It has macro that get you real close. Bokeh? Yup.</li>
<li><strong>Video</strong>: Flip? Good bye. The iPhone 3GS can take video with a 640 x 480 resolution at 30fps. That's good enough for most applications. You can trim the video and then tap to upload to YouTube. Nice.</li>
<li><strong>Voice Control</strong>: You like your RAZR because it has voice control? It took a long time (too long actually) but the iPhone 3GS has it too. Just press the button until you hear a tone. "Call Mom." And you've got Mom on the line.</li>
<li><strong>GPS</strong>: The full-blown kind. With a compass to make it more accurate. Tom Tom announced its <a href="http://iphone.tomtom.com/">Tom Tom for iPhone</a>. No need to have a separate GPS device.</li>
<li><strong>Voice Memos</strong>: A student and need to tape lectures? Or just want to record your own? This feature save a lot of hassle.</li>
<li><strong>7.2mbps HSDPA</strong>: Data transmission speeds are twice as fast. That's always nice in a Web 2.0 world. Let's hope AT&amp;T delivers.</li>
<li><strong>Longer Battery Life</strong>: 3 more hours of data on WiFi to 9. 6 more hours of audio to 30. 3 more hours of video to 10. talk time is the same at 5 hours.</li>
<li><strong>Water &amp; Oil Resistant</strong>: Wow, this is a surprise. You don't have to worry about water or oil spills on the iPhone 3GS.</li>
<li><strong>Nike+</strong>: Built-in support. Great for those that love to walk, jog and run.</li>
<li><strong>Faster Processor</strong>: Everything is faster up to twice as fast. The fact that you have to close an app to get another running takes much less time. You almost don't miss background processes with fast task switching.</li><br />
