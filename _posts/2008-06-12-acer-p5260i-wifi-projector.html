<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=acer">Acer</a>'s P5260i is a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=front-projection">projector</a> that can be connected wirelessly: 802.11b/g to be exact. Unfortunately, there is no 'n' support. Even though the P5260i has a HDMI connection, the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dlp">DLP</a> chip is limited to <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1024-x-768">1024 x 768</a> pixels. If you pump more into it then it will scale it down; not the type of experience you'd want when you're watching your $25 Blu-ray title or via your $80/mo HD cable subscription. You don't want to waste a single pixel.</p>
<p>The P5260i shines as a business projector, especially a business that deals with too many cables during meetings. The 1024 x 768 pixel format will be much better suited for PowerPoint presentations. But even in the business market the P5260i has some serious challenges. First off is that every business person that I know already has a notebook PC with a wide LCD. Either the PowerPoint presentation will look it it has grown taller, or you'll need to change the pixel format of the notebook PC. Either way it is a pain. So, to all the projector companies in the world: let's go wide, shall we?</p>
