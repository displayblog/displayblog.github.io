<p><a href="http://www.dpreview.com/previews/PanasonicGF1/">DPReview</a>: Ah, exactly the camera that I have been waiting for since having seen the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/06/15/olympus-e-p1-micro-four-thirds-compact-digital-camera/">PEN EP-1</a> from Olympus. Panasonic's Lumix DMC-GF1 packs a 12.1 megapixel Live MOS sensor with an ISO sensitivity up to 3200 in a rangefinder body.</p>
<p>Video? No problem! How does 720p at 320fps sound? The video is packed in AVCHD Lite or Motion JPEG format. Although 1080p recording capability is cool, I am not sure that most computer systems or TVs out there can display 1080p very well. And for most people the difference between 720p and 1080p is subtle enough that they won't know the difference. The display is a 3-inch LCD probably with a VGA-class resolution. And of course you need to be able to connect this little wonder to your HDTV and you can do that via an HDMI connection.</p>
<p>You'll need to wait until October to get the chance to buy one of two kits: one with a 20mm f/1.7 prime lens and the other with a 14-45mm f/3.5-5.6 zoom lens. Both will be priced at US$899.95. Compare this to the Olympus PEN E-P1 that's going for US$800. Choices choices.</p>
