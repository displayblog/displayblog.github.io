<blockquote><p>We only got to heft the one-pound slate for a few seconds, but we got the basic feel of the device in the hand -- warm to the touch, solid if a little plasticky, with a responsive glass touchscreen up top and a bottom that's mildly rubberized.</blockquote></p>
<p>That's not what I saw. There was a slight delay between the touch gestures and the actual response. What makes or breaks a UI is whether or not this slight delay exists. I was also discouraged to see how much RIM copied Palm's webOS.</p>
