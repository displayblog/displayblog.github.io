  x 480</a> resolution is good but I hope the fonts aren't too small. With more
  resolution you'll also need a bit more powerful GPU to make sure every UI bit is
  running smoothly. The 4.3-inch display is also on the large side--a plus, but just
  a reminder: the average size of our hands don't change much. I personally like larger
  displays and more resolution but the trick is to make it work in your hands and
  with your eyes. Let's see if Archos did that with its Phone Tablet... at CES. From
  the video the Phone Tablet looks very well made and quite sexy. "

<p><strong>Titanium</strong> Remember <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=apple&amp;sa=Search">Apple</a>'s Titanium PowerBook G4? It was made of titanium and it sounded good too. And there's good reason: titanium has a high strength-to-weight ratio and is corrosion resistant. But there was a major problem with the Titanium PowerBook G4s: terrible WiFi signal strength. It turns out titanium doesn't do a good job of letting these signals through to the radios. I am sure Archos worked around this limitation to make sure its Phone Tablet has solid radio signals. I'm just wondering why titanium when the company could have used cheaper materials such as aluminum and/or magnesium alloy for most of the benefits of light weight strength.</p>
