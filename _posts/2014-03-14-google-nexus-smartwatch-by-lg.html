<blockquote><p>More Google (LG) smartwatch specs: 1.65" IPS LCD @ 280x280, 512MB RAM, 4GB internal storage, processor TBD.</blockquote></p>
<p>A 280x280 pixel format would make the Google Nexus Smartwatch <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/01/06/ces-2014-pebble/">a square, which is a good thing in my opinion</a>. These hardware specs are interesting &mdash; for instance, I'm glad the display is IPS &mdash; but what I'm most curious about is the experience of using it: Will it be like using a small, square, Android smartphone? Or will it be something completely different, more intuitive, more watch-like?</p>
