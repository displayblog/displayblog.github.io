<blockquote><p>The BlackBerry PlayBook with Wi-Fi will be available in three models and will feature a Manufacturer&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $499 in the United States and Canada.</blockquote></p>
<p>The BlackBerry PlayBook matches the $499 price of the iPad 2 and will be available at AT&T, Best Buy, RadioShack, Sprint, Verizon, you name it. Unfortunately the 7-inch LCD is limited to just 1024x600 pixels, though resolution wise it is a better-than-iPad 2 169.6 ppi. Available on April 19th.</p>
