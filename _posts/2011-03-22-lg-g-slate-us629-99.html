<p><a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2011/03/21/lg-g-slate-on-t-mobile-gets-priced/">CrunchGear</a>: The LG G-Slate is an 8.9-inch Honeycomb tablet that is 3D capable, meaning you can record in 3D and view in 3D. The G-Slate connects to T-Mobile's 4G network with a US$529.99 price after a $100 mail-in-rebate. You're also chained to a two-year agreement. If you're going after the iPad 2 might as well go all the way. My recommendation? Reduce the price to $499.99 out the door without a mail-in-rebate and get rid of the two-year leash.</p>
