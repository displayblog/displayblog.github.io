<p><a href="http://www.macdirectory.com/component/option,com_exclusive_news/task,viewDetail/news_id,3092/">Mac Directory</a> interviewed Al Gore:</p>
<blockquote><p>MD: Are there Macs in the White House? </p>
<p>AG: I had the last Mac in the West Wing. I was the last holdout and a lot of specialized programs that are in use in the executive branch were developed on the PC platform and I finally and reluctantly switched over. But I'm glad I switched back now. And I think now there's really no reason not to switch to Mac because they can run any PC program now. </blockquote></p>
