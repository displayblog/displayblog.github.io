<p>Richard Shim, DisplaySearch Senior Analyst, in an interview with <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13924_3-57329257-64/production-starts-for-ipad-3-qxga-display-analyst/">Brooke Crothers, CNET</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It's happening--QXGA, 2048x1536. Panel production has started [for the next-generation iPad]. There's three suppliers.</blockquote></p>
<p>Those LCD manufacturers are LG Display, Samsung, and Sharp.</p>
<blockquote><p>I would imagine there would be concerns about [adequate] supply given the resolution of the display but you've got three different suppliers at this point. They should have enough to launch the product</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple's iPhone or iPad launches are not regular launches and more like blockbuster movie launches. Millions of 9.7-inch 2048x1536 IPS LCD panels will need have been manufactured, integrated into iPad 3s, distributed and stocked. And that's just at launch.</p>
<p>Shim expects the iPad 3 will be ready to be shipped in January with volumes ramping up in February and March. I think that's a bit early and expect launch to be in March. And the time between announcement and launch has been shrinking. It was mere days for the iPad 2. So when I say I expect the iPad 3 to launch in March I'm also saying I expect the announcement to be made around that time.</p>
<p>LGD, Sharp, and Samsung have all been working toward perfecting the iPad Retina Displays for a while. Limited production runs have been going on for some time, but maybe the three are at the starting point of ramping production.</p>
<p>Like many others I have been waiting for the iPad to undergo the same Retinal metamorphosis the iPhone underwent. The visual experience on the iPad 3 should be simply amazing.</p>
