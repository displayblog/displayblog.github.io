<blockquote><p>Check out this video of the iPad 2 playing Chair Entertainment&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>Infinity Blade</em> on a 50-inch LG HDTV running at 1080p, thanks to the new iPad HDMI adapter. That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a ten-dollar game looking just as lurid and beautiful in high-definition as a $60 Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 game.</blockquote></p>
<p>The video does look <em>good</em>. I'm thinking how an A5-based iPod touch with an HDMI adapter might completely destroy the market for Xbox or PS3.</p>
