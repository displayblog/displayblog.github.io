<blockquote><p>The OLED display on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is the best performing OLED display to date across the board, including picture quality and color accuracy. But its most impressive advancement is a significantly brighter screen (a traditional weakness for OLEDs) - it's brighter than LCDs, hitting an incredible 660 cd/m2 in high ambient light, the brightest mobile display we have ever tested. An impressive achievement for OLEDs!</p>
<p>In a span of just a few years OLED display technology is now challenging and even exceeding the performance of the best LCDs across the board in brightness, contrast, color accuracy, color management, picture quality, screen uniformity, and viewing angles.</blockquote></p>
<p>Impressive. OLED has caught up to LCD. There's just one thing: Does it last as long?</p>
