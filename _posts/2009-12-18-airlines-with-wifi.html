<p>The "<a href="http://www.jaunted.com/story/2009/12/17/03742/540/travel/Jaunted%27s+2009+Airline+In-Flight+WiFi+Status+Update">Jaunted's 2009 Airline In-Flight WiFi Guide</a>" spells out which airlines offer WiFi. Good to know. Seems like Virgin America is leading the pack with 100% WiFi and both 100V and USB plugs at your seat.</p>
