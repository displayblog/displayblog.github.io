<p>I will be attending the 2011 SGIA Printed Electronics & Membrane Switch Symposium from June 14 to 16 at the San Jose Convention Center, San Jose, CA and am looking forward to these talks:</p>
<p><strong>Hi-Definition Flat Screen Printing in a Roll to Roll Format</strong> by Mike Thompson, Kammann Northeast Sales Manager at 4:30pm on June 15:</p>
<blockquote><p>High speed, roll-to-roll printing of conductive, dielectrics and epoxies opens up a whole world of questions and opportunities for the Printed Electronics Industry. The ability to print, coat, and dry within a minimal production footprint is a luxury of Kammann K61 users. We will [illustrate] the practical uses for roll to roll screen printing and the reasons why this industry is demanding controlled web tension machines for maximum efficiency of printed electronics. [...] The focus will be to demonstrate practical applications and break down industry examples of where this technology greatly benefits converting and production cycles.</blockquote></p>
<p><strong>Thick Film EL and OLED Technologies in Printed Electronics: Fundamentals and Practical Aspects</strong> by Eric Bruton, Jost Chemical at 9:30am on June 16:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thick film AC electroluminescent (EL) has been an important technology in printed electronics for some time, from night lights to the [RAZR] phone back light and SuperFlex lighting. Now the organic light emitting diode (OLED) is a quickly developing technology that promises to be the next significant jump in printed electronic light emitting devices, having already made its way to conventional printing processes (i.e. screen printing). Both of these technologies have multiple applications, including displays, backlighting, white lighting, etc. Here we will discuss the fundamental workings and materials used in thick film AC EL and OLED technologies to produce lamps. Understanding the fundamentals of thick film AC EL and OLED technologies is essential to improving functionality and developing new products and applications for them. These fundamentals include the physics of electron movement, the chemistry of the materials in the different layers of the lamp, and the relationship between the optics of the lamp and the light leaving it.</blockquote></p>
<p><strong>Interactive Electrochromic Magazine Cover: A Case Study Panel Presentation</strong> by Alain Briancon (NTERA), Malcolm Keif (California Polytechnic State University), and Richard Morris (Si-Cal) at 4:30pm on June 16:</p>
<blockquote><p>The February 2011 issue of Canvas Magazine was the first entirely printed, interactive magazine cover on a publication, with more than 10,000 copies produced and mailed to subscribers. The purpose of this presentation is to discuss the design and development of the electrochromic cover. Included in this case study will be how the technology was selected, project goals, partners and the role of students in the project.</p>
<p>Additionally, we will discuss what we learned from the project, including ways to improve production effectiveness and pitfalls to avoid.</blockquote></p>
<p>And then there are booths where all the interesting stuff is hiding. I'll be around the 3M (membrane switch), Bayer Material Science (functional films), and FUJIFILM Dimatix (materials printer) booths learning more about printed electronics. Let me know if you are planning to attend the <a href="http://www.sgia.org/events/printed_electronics/11/index.cfm">2011 SGIA Printed Electronics & Membrane Switch Symposium</a>.</p>
