<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/1/5672626/starting-today-yahoo-will-not-honor-do-not-track-settings">Russell Brandom, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Starting today, anyone visiting Yahoo will be tracked by default, regardless of whether they've enabled the Do Not Track setting on their browser.</blockquote></p>
<p>That's why I have <a href="https://disconnect.me/">Disconnect</a> installed on my Chrome browser, and always will.</p>

<blockquote><p>We fundamentally believe the best web is a personalized one.</blockquote></p>
<p>I don't like passively receiving automated personalizations by some big company's personalization algorithms; I'd rather do that on my own.</p>
