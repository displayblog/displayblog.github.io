<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/7/5074194/amazon-kindle-fire-hdx-review-8-9-inch">Dan Seifert, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Amazon&acirc;&euro;&trade;s always touted the displays on its tablets, and the screen it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s using on the HDX 8.9 is a doozy. At a ridiculous 2560 x 1600-pixel resolution and 339ppi, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s either higher-resolution or more pixel-dense than virtually any other tablet on the market. It also has great viewing angles, excellent color reproduction, and high brightness levels. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s really just a great screen, whether you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re gaming, watching video, or reading text &mdash; it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s right up there with, if not better than, the Retina display on the iPad Air.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote><p>The 2560-by-1600-pixel screen features the by-now-customary &acirc;&euro;&oelig;better than the human eye&acirc;&euro; 339-ppi density, and the image quality is further enhanced with what Amazon promises is &acirc;&euro;&oelig;100 percent sRGB color accuracy.&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>The improvement is hard to fully appreciate unless you lay the HDX side-by-side with the Air, but it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a gorgeous display with rich contrast, and the improvement is noticeable. This is probably the best screen I own for watching movies.</blockquote></p>
<p>These reviews are right in line with <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2013/11/04/flagship-tablet-display-technology-shoot-out/">Raymond Soneira's display test results</a>: The Kindle Fire HDX 8.9-inch has the best tablet display today.</p>
