<p>LG Electronics (LGE) is introducing a 60" plasma display panel (PDP) TV with a wood bezel or frame. LGE is releasing only 1000 such units in the South Korean domestic market in March.</p>
<p>Continued research to improve flat panel display (FPD) TV into its surroundings is the likely reason why LGE is releasing such a unique product. Concerns regarding the use of wood would include: expansion and contraction due to moisture or lack thereof, changes in color, lower resistance to sharp objects relative to aluminum or plastic, etc. I am assuming LGE did its best to ensure long-term quality of the wood on the 60PT1.</p>
