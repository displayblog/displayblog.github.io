<p><em>Tablet</em></p>
<p>ViewSonic showcased a 24-inch Jelly Bean display. Or is it a giant tablet. Reminds me of the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/01/07/lenovo-27-inch-tablet">27-inch Lenovo IdeaCentre Horizon</a>.</p>
<p>A pre-production Surface Pro was shown. Tom Warren, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/9/3857076/microsoft-surface-pro-in-depth-impressions">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Surface Pro has a gorgeous 10.6-inch ClearType Full HD Display that outputs a 1920 x 1080 resolution. I say it's gorgeous because this display is unprecedented on this type of device. Text reproduction and colors were spot on and viewing angles were great for tablet use.</blockquote></p>
<p>Unprecedented? Yes, unprecedented. The Surface Pro should be categorized as a full-blown computer in slate form, and not like the iPad or Android tablets. Remember the term "tablet PC"? That's what the Surface Pro is. And as far as I can remember there has not been a tablet PC this small with this many pixels.</p>
<p><em>Camera</em></p>
<p>Polaroid is getting whipped. Jeff Blagdon at <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3849692/polaroids-im1836-interchangeable-lens-camera-is-bad">The Verge</a> thought the Polaroid iM1836 mirror-less interchangeable lens Android camera was awful. Now Michael Zhang at <a href="http://www.petapixel.com/2013/01/09/a-hands-on-first-look-at-the-android-powered-polaroid-im1836">PetaPixel</a> thinks it's "a bit like playing with a mid-level smartphone combined with a mid-level airplane entertainment system."</p>
<p>A bit more about that squarish Canon N. <a href="http://www.petapixel.com/2013/01/09/hands-on-with-the-portable-and-flexible-canon-powershot-n">PetaPixel</a>'s Michael Zhang:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unfortunately for Canon, smartphones DO exist, so the question will be whether the general public is still willing to shell out $300 and carry an additional gadget in order to document their daily lives.</blockquote></p>
<p>I think the trend is clear: We want to carry one gadget that can do everything. Fortunately a lot of great smartphones can be that one gadget. And not so fortunate for Canon these smartphones take great photos, videos, and are always connected. If only Canon made the N an Android camera instead... </p>
<p><em>Notebook</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/09/Dell-XPS-13-1080p-screen-hands-on/">Engadget</a>: Dell XPS 13 had a terrible 1366x768 display, now it's better with a 1920x1080 LCD sporting an improved color gamut of 72%... of? The improved display option will cost an extra US$300. That's expensive.</p>
<p><em>Smartphone</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/9/3855960/samsung-flexible-oled-phone-prototype-hands-on">Samsung showed off a prototype smartphone sporting a flexible OLED</a>. Samsung has a name for that curvy OLED: Youm. Terrible name. The flexing capability of displays will certainly come in handy for certain applications, but this? I don't think we have a pressing need to look at our smartphones from the side. Samsung thinks it might be good for notifications such as text messages and stock tickers. I think this is a good example of a solution searching for a problem.</p>
<p><em>Monitor</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/9/3855420/lg-display-30-inch-4k-tv-at-ces-2013">LG Display introduced a 30-inch 4K LCD monitor with a 4096x2160 pixel format</a>. That's four 1024 pixel windows on a single display. I can get used to that.</p>
<p><em>AIO</em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6585/lenovo-thinkcentre-m92z-antiglare-touchscreens">Lenovo ThinkCentre M92z</a> is an all-in-one (AIO) sporting a 23-inch IPS LCD with a 1920x1080 pixel format. Touch is optional, but what a touch it is. A specially etched glass is used resulting in a matte display that's resistant to wear and fingerprints. Soon everyone will be touting how fingerprint resistant their touch displays are. A good thing.</p>
<p><em>TV</em></p>
<p>Sony unveiled a 4K OLED TV. So did Panasonic. Now anyone willing to procure a <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20130109PR205.html">56-inch 4K OLED TV panel from AUO</a> can, too.</p>
