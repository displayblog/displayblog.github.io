<p>On March 12, Royal Philips Electronics NV announced that it had sold 6.7% or 24M shares of LG Display for net proceeds of around E680M. The company now holds just 13.2% stake at LGD, formerly known as LG.Philips LCD (LPL).</p>
<p>
It is fitting that LG.Philips LCD changed its name to LG Display. Philips is no longer a meaningful player at LGD.<br />
