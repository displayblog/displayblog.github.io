<p><a href="http://www.chimei-innolux.com/opencms/cmo/modules/news/MCNews/mcnews_0182.html?__locale=en">Chimei Innolux</a>: I just received a press release in my inbox. Though there were several announcements made by CMI there was only one product that interested me:</p>
<blockquote><p>CMI&acirc;&euro;&trade;s 9.7-inch and 330-ppi ultra high resolution displays, using TAOS (Transparent Amorphous Oxide Semiconductors) and AAS (Azimuthal Anchoring Switch) technologies, meet these requirements by offering higher resolution and refined image quality, delivering a plsasure viewing experience with any content.</blockquote></p>
<p>Unfortunately there isn't much more information regarding this display, but this is a much higher resolution 9.7-inch LCD than the one used in the iPad (264 ppi). I guess CMI's version of IPS is called AAS.</p>
