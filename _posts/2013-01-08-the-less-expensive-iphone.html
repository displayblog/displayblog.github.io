<p>Jessica E. Lessin, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324391104578230060513922882.html">The Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple Inc. is working on a lower-end iPhone, according to people briefed on the matter, a big shift in corporate strategy as its supremacy in smartphones has slipped.</blockquote></p>
<p>The less expensive iPhone has always been the previous iPhone model. For example, the less expensive iPhone right now is the iPhone 4S, which you can get for US$99 with a new two year agreement. The least expensive iPhone is the iPhone 4, which you can get for free with a new two year agreement. When the iPhone 5S comes out the iPhone 5 (without the 'S') will become the less expensive iPhone, and the iPhone 4S will become the least expensive iPhone. At least that's how Apple has worked on lower-end iPhones since the original iPhone.</p>
<p>This year might be different since the iPhone 5 has a Lightning connector instead of the 30-pin connector. I don't think Apple, after it starts selling the iPhone 5S, wants to sell a whole bunch of iPhone 4S's with the old connector when the price goes to zero. So maybe Apple is working on a stripped down free iPhone 5. An 8GB version perhaps?</p>
<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/01/10/schiller-iphone">John Gruber</a>. Chinese newspaper <a href="http://newspaper.jfdaily.com/xwwb/html/2013-01/09/content_954119.htm#">Shanghai Evening News</a> interviewed Apple SVP of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller. Matthew Panzarino, <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2013/01/10/apples-schiller-says-that-despite-the-popularity-of-cheap-smartphones-they-will-not-be-the-future-of-apples-products/">The Next Web</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;At first, non-smartphones were popular in the Chinese market, now cheap smartphones are more popular and non-smartphones are out,&acirc;&euro; Schiller added later. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Despite the popularity of cheap smartphones, this will never be the future of Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s products. In fact, although Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s market share of smartphones is just about 20%, we own the 75% of the profit.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>Cheap smartphones are popular in China. Not-so-cheap smartphones are, too. Let's assume the top 10% of the Chinese population of 1.35 billion can afford iPhones. That's 135 million, which is probably popular enough&mdash;and profitable enough&mdash;for Apple to focus on serving.</p>
