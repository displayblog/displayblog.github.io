<p><a href="http://www.9to5mac.com/50297/exclusive-ipad-2-screen-fresh-from-china">9To5Mac</a> hopped on over to <a href="http://www.ifixyouri.com/16-ipad-repairs">iFixYouri</a>, ordered and acquired a LCD with model number LP097X02-SLN1, which is claimed to be the LCD used in the iPad 2. The LCD is manufactured by LG Display. No surprise there as LGD is the primary display supplier for the current iPad. The specs for it are as follows:<br />
<font face="verdana" size="2"></p>
<ul>
<li>Display Tech: H-IPS TFT LCD</li>
<li>Display Size: 9.7 inches</li>
<li>Pixel Format: 1024x768</li>
<li>Aspect Ratio: 4:3</li><br />
</ul><br />
</font></p>
<p>The letter L stands for LG Display. All LCDs manufactured by LGD have model numbers that start with the letter L. The P stands for portable. The 097 stands for 9.7 inches. The X stands for XGA or 1024x768. The rest I am not certain. So what's so special about this LP097X02-SLN1 LCD? There are three things going for it.</p>
<p>First, it is claimed to be lighter. Not sure by how much compared to the current LP097X02-SLA3. Second, it is thinner by about 1mm. Every millimeter counts because that extra space can be used to pack in a bit more battery, which in turn lets you use the iPad a little longer. Third, the bezel is considerably thinner. Now this might not be such a big deal since the iPad <em>requires</em> a rather thickish bezel, which is what we use to hold the iPad. But it really is a big deal: it allows Jonathan Ive to taper the edges of the iPad 2, like he did to the most recent iPod touch. I also think the iPad 2 will have the cover glass optically laminated to the LCD, like what Apple did with the iPhone 4. I would also like the display to be less glossy and bounce less ambient light.</p>
<p>There is one thing missing though.</p>
<p>The letter Q. Which would stand for QXGA or 2048x1536. <em>If</em> this LP097X02-XLN1 LCD by LGD is in fact the display used in the iPad 2 then it also means that the iPad 2 will not have a Retina Display. For that to happen we'll need to look for a LCD model number that starts with LP097Q.</p>
<p>The iPad 2 is shaping up to be thinner, lighter, and possibly with a longer-lasting battery life. If the optical lamination, reduced glare and reflection bits turn out to be true, though mere incremental changes, I expect the iPad experience to be significantly better than what it is today. Of course, I'll be holding out for the next <em>next</em> iPad, which I hope will sport a Retina Display.</p>
