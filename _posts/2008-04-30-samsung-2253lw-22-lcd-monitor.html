<p><a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/consumer/detail/detail.do?group=computersperipherals&type=monitors&subtype=lcd&model_cd=LS22AQVJFV/XAA">Samsung</a>: Another Samsung 22-inch LCD monitor! The 2253LW, similar to the 2243NWX has a superb 8000:1 dynamic contrast ratio specification. Aside the from the size and the limited viewing angle, the two are distinct. For instance, the GTG response time of 2ms for the 2253LW is extremely fast. What this means is that watching motion picture or playing games on it would look fairly good. The DVD-D with HDCP will allow you to watch HD content without a hiccup. Also the design is fairly nice. I am noticing a transparent bar on the bottom of the 2253LW. I wonder what that's for.</p>
