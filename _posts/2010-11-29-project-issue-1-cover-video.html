<p>Richard Branson's <em>Project</em> magazine is rumored to launch tomorrow. <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5701553/richard-bransons-ipad+only-mag-may-launch-tomorrow-with-tron-goodness">Gizmodo</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It'll be exciting to see just what a magazine built from the ground up for the iPad can accomplish, rather than titles that have fumbled&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to varying degrees&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;in the process of translating dead tree content into a tablet experience. Leading the charge in the inaugural issue: that Bridges profile, a 205mph "supercar," the search for Earth 2.0, and other stuff that just seems, well, cool.</blockquote></p>
<p>Yes, very cool.</p>
