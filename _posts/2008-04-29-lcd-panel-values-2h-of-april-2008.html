<p>For those who purchase LCD panels, this set of information might be interesting. I took publicly available pricing information for LCD panels from Witsview and DisplaySearch, took the average, and then did some analysis on maximum value.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this blog post, maximum value is defined as dollar per megapixel ($/MP, lower is better). What this value shows is how many pixels you are getting for each dollar. Many might say that overall diagonal size is a much more important indicator and that might be true. But given the same size, I prefer a higher resolution LCD leading me to conclude that I value the number of pixels.</p>
<p>The value of pixels can be seen clearly in the trend toward 1080p in LCD TVs. Given the same size, say 42", most consumers will desire a 1080p model compared to a 720p. The recent trend toward 1080p 32" LCD TVs is another case in point.</p>
<p>For the second half of April 2008, here are the top three values by application in terms of $/MP:</p>
<ol>
<strong>LCD monitor panel</strong></p>
<li>20" 1680 x 1050 at 79.93 $/MP<br />
</li>
<li>22" 1680 x 1050 at 89.57 $/MP<br />
</li>
<li>17" 1280 x 1024 at 92.70 $/MP<br />
</li></ol><br />
I was slightly surprised by these results. I thought clearly 22" would have the value advantage, but this shows that for the same amount of pixels a 20" has the better value than 22".</p>
<ol>
<strong>NBPC panel</strong></p>
<li>14.1" 1280 x 800 at 93.26 $/MP<br />
</li>
<li>17.0" 1440 x 900 at 93.75 $/MP<br />
</li>
<li>15.4" 1280 x 800 at 96.68 $/MP<br />
</li></ol><br />
The most popular 15.4" 1280 x 800 does not have a value advantage over 14.1" 1280 x 800 or 17.0" 1440 x 900.</p>
<ol>
<strong>LCD TV panel</strong></p>
<li>26" 1366 x 768 at 224.48 $/MP<br />
</li>
<li>32" 1366 x 768 at 310.75 $/MP<br />
</li>
<li>37" 1366 x 768 at 413.22 $/MP<br />
</li></ol><br />
The results for LCD TV panels are fairly straightforward because all three have the same number of pixels. Unfortunately, 1080p LCD TV panel prices were not publicly available from both market research companies. DisplaySearch did post a $750 price on a 46" 1080p LCD TV panel that puts the value at 361.69 $/MP, a much better value than 37".</p>
