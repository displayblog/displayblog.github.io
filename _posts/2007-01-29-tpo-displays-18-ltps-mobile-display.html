<p>TPO Displays announced on January 25 a 1.8" LTPS sporting a pixel format of just 120 x 160 to 128 x 160 also known as QQVGA or Quarter QVGA. The 1.8" display can display up to 262,000 colors with standard CPU and RGB interfaces. Size was minimized by incorporating one of the smallest driver ICs and is currently in volume production.</p>

<p>Research and development is racing toward making mobile displays smaller and thinner enabling for slimmer mobile phones. Although this trend will continue there will be a point when the human hand will consider it too thin and begin to feel uncomfortably thin. Of course there is the challenge of keeping very thin devices durable as well.</p>
