<p><a href="http://www.phonescoop.com/news/item.php?n=6926">Phonescoop</a>: November 8th is the day when you can order a Windows Phone 7 device online or buy at a local AT&T store. No preordering. The 8th is a Monday, so I'm guessing the folks who were thinking about WP7 phones for business-related activities won't be in line, instead there will probably be a few Xbox fans.</p>
