<p><a href="http://news.consumerreports.org/cars/2011/04/back-fire-tomtom-sold-user-data-to-police-motorists-then-targeted-with-speed-traps.html?EXTKEY=I72RSC0">Consumer Reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Following reports that TomTom had sold traffic data collected from GPS device users to police who then used it to determine locations for speed traps, the company has issued a statement and video in an effort to appease angry customers.</blockquote></p>
<p>You buy a TomTom GPS device expecting that it will help you get to where you want to go. It turns out it did that and then some: it also helped others, maybe including you, get a traffic ticket.</p>
<p>I don't have much GPS data to hide since I'm almost always stuck in front of my computer at home, but nevertheless I don't like being tracked. Not only did TomTom track users of its GPS device the company penalized them for buying its products. Never was I a TomTom customer and it seems that's how it'll be for the foreseeable future.</p>
