<p><a href="http://www.displaysearch.com/cps/rde/xchg/displaysearch/hs.xsl/120620_global_lcd_tv_shipments_fall_for_the_first_time_ever_in_q112.asp">NPD DisplaySearch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Worldwide TV shipments fell almost 8% Y/Y in Q1&acirc;&euro;&trade;12, the steepest rate of decline since Q2&acirc;&euro;&trade;09. Total TV shipments for the quarter were 51M units [...] The biggest contributor to this decline was a slowdown in shipments of LCD TVs, which fell year-on-year for the first time in the history of the category, declining just over 3%, to 43M units.</blockquote></p>
<p>What a title. Note the 43 million. That number represents <em>shipments</em>, shipments by LCD TV brands into the channel, not units sold to customers. It can't be since no one knows that number.</p>
<p>And you have to suspend your disbelief and assume LCD TV brands have a clue as to what TV customers want. 3D TVs with glasses? Smart TVs with keyboards? LCD TV brands shipped 3% less in Q1'12 compared to Q1'11. Which means? Not much.</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite the weak results on a unit basis, demand for larger sizes continues to grow. The market share for 40&acirc;&euro; and larger TVs increased from just under 31% a year ago to more than 37% in Q1&acirc;&euro;&trade;12 with total unit shipments for 40&acirc;&euro;+ rising 12% Y/Y.</blockquote></p>
<p>How do you get from TV brands reporting shipments into the channel to commenting about <em>demand</em>? Would not a report on how many TVs were <em>sold</em> to customers on a worldwide basis need to come first to have an intelligent discussion about demand?</p>
