<p>Christopher Ketcham in <em><a href="http://www.gq.com/cars-gear/gear-and-gadgets/201002/warning-cell-phone-radiation?currentPage=1">Warning: Your Cell Phone May Be Hazardous to Your Health</a></em> writes about damning evidence suggesting your cell phone may cause brain damage:</p>
<blockquote><p>Though the scientific debate is heated and far from resolved, there are multiple reports, mostly out of Europe's premier research institutions, of cell-phone and PDA use being linked to "brain aging," brain damage, early-onset Alzheimer's, senility, DNA damage, and even sperm die-offs (many men, after all, keep their cell phones in their pants pockets or attached at the hip). In September 2007, the European Union's environmental watchdog, the European Environment Agency, warned that cell-phone technology "could lead to a health crisis similar to those caused by asbestos, smoking, and lead in petrol."</blockquote><br />
The entire article is a must-read, so brew your coffee and set aside about 30 minutes and try to soak all of this in. Then, think of ways to minimize the risk.</p>
