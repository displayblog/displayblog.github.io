<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lg">LG</a>'s 32LC7DC is a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=32"-lcd-tv">32" LCD TV</a> geared for commercial applications such as B2B, healthcare, hospitality and IT. In most commercial applications high-resolution displays are not necessary as most people who will be seeing it are quite a distance away. So in this context the content that is created are generally vivid images with big text. The pixel format, true to the intended marketplace, is just <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1366-x-768">1366 x 768</a>. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dynamic-contrast">Dynamic contrast</a> ratio is a healthy 6000:1, but nothing that will knock your socks off. It has a built-in tuner that supports ATSC, NTSC and QAM. I am not sure, but looking at the very good viewing angles of 178/178, I would guess that it is using an <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=ips">IPS</a> panel. The response time is a fairly fast 5ms. The 32LC7DC is <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=energy-star">Energy Star</a> rated and sips less than 1W when in standby mode, a feature that is quite important in a commercial application since will almost never be turned off. But just because it is geared toward the commercial market doesn't mean you the regular consumer can't buy it.</p>
