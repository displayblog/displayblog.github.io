<p>Is it true? <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=dell">Dell</a> has beat Apple to the embedded-webcam-in-monitor race? I thought Dell was the quick follower when it came to technology innovation? Maybe it is no longer true. Or maybe it is <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=apple">Apple</a> being slow this time, though they have had embedded webcams on its iMac line for some time now. It's good to see Dell innovate and it seems the LCD panel is of a high-performance variety with 3ms response time and a very high contrast ratio of 2000:1. But the one thing that you should watch out for is that Samsung's <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=pva">PVA</a> LCDs have a very high contrast ratio when you're looking dead on; the contrast ratio drops quickly as you move away from zero degree. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=lg+display">LG.Philip LCD</a>'s <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=ips">IPS</a>, on the other hand, has a rather low contrast ratio at zero degree but falls slowly as you move from side to side. Which is better? I prefer IPS, but that' just my personal opinion. Dell's SP2008WFP seems to be a solid <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-monitor">LCD monitor</a>.</p>

<p><em>Update September 28, 2007</em></p>
<p>As of today, Dell officially announced the SP2008WFP. The integrated video camera is something new and even lets you take pictures at 1600 x 1200. I am not sure, but the video is probably capped at 640 x 480. Unfortunately for all <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=20">20"</a> and 22" <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=%22lcd+monitor%22">LCD monitors</a>, the pixel format of 1680 x 1050 is just useless for HD: <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=720p">720p</a> is scaled up and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=1080p">1080p</a> is scaled down. Scaling technology is pretty good in most high-end TVs, but for a monitor, I'm not sure. To get the best experience with this monitor, I would stay away from watching movies in hidef.</p>
