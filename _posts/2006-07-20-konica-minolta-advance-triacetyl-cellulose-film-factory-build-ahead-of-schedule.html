<p>Konica Minolta Holdings Inc. will advance the building of its fourth triacetyl cellulose (TAC) film factory by a few months: from this fall to summer. According to Reuters, Konica Minolta and Fuji Photo Film are the only two major producers of TAC film. TAC film is used to protect the polarizers in a LCD. With all major LCD applications growing well, such as LCD TVs, demand for TAC film has been strong, the main reason why Konica Minolta is building the TAC film factory ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>According to Konica Minolta, the breakdown of cost of manufacturing for TAC film is as follows:</p>
<p>11.0% Production of materials and parts<br />
85.6% Product manufacture<br />
2.0% Transportation<br />
1.4% Disposal</p>
<p>The company states that it will "promote reductions in energy consumed per unit of production." This is a unique statement as most companies are "consumed" with reducing cost.</p>
