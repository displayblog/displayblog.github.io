<blockquote><p>As we heard before, this tablet appears to be an Asus product &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; specs include a 1280 x 800, 7-inch display, 1.3GHz Tegra 3 processor, 1GB of RAM, and a 12-core GeForce GPU. It's also reportedly priced very aggressively &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; the 8GB version will come in at $199, with a 16GB version available for $249.</blockquote></p>
<p>Priced aggressively? Google better, with a 7-inch 1280x800 display.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.06.27:</em> According to <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/27/3120884/google-nexus-7-first-image-leak/in/2885052">The Verge</a>, at least it's IPS.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.06.28:</em> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/28/3124041/asus-me370t-nexus-7-transformation-google-nvidia">Sean Hollister, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The truth is that the Nexus 7 is the Asus ME370T, an Android tablet whose destiny has repeatedly changed.</blockquote></p>
<p><em>Update 2012.07.03:</em> According to <a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Nexus-7-Teardown/9623/3">iFixit</a> the 7-inch LCD is manufactured by Hydis with a model number HV070WX2. Gorilla Glass (version 2 or not is unsure) is fused to the LCD.</p>

<p><em>Update 2012.07.23:</em> The <a href="http://youtu.be/qqiSE-ukmgc">first commercial for the Nexus 7</a> titled "Camping" is a success: made me want to get one and go camping.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.07.23:</em> <a href="http://www.displaymate.com/news.html">Raymond Soneira</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Intensity Scale (often called the Gray Scale) is way off. The display's Brightness fails to increase sufficiently for bright image content, causing bright image detail to be compressed and lost. See the Figure at left for the Nexus 7 and <a href="http://www.displaymate.com/Gamma_6.html">this Figure to see what the Intensity Scale should look like</a>. The Nexus 7 Display Stumbles and Falls Short both figuratively and literally... There is about a 25 percent compression of bright image content, which is quite substantial. This holds for both the Gallery Viewer and the Chrome Browser. On some cheap displays this is done intentionally by the manufacturer because the compression actually makes them appear artificially bright. Here I think it's probably just incompetence by the manufacturer, which is too bad because they messed up a really nice display.</blockquote></p>
<p><em>Update 2012.07.26:</em> <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6073/the-google-nexus-7-review/3">AnandTech</a> measured the display on the Nexus 7 and here are the simplified results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brightness (white): 312 nits. The Nexus 7 is in last place among the tablets measured by AnandTech. For comparison the Samsung Galaxy 10.1 has a white brightness of 492 nits and the iPad (3) sports 394.</li>
<li>Brightness (black): 0.37 nits. Black is black on the Nexus 7 and trails behind only the ASUS Transformer Pad Infinity (0.35 nits) on AnandTech's list of tablets. The iPad 3 leaks a bit more light with black brightness at 0.45 nits.</li>
<li>Contrast: 852. The Nexus 7 is in the middle of the pack. The ASUS Transformer Pad Infinity leads with 1318 and the iPad (3) is slightly better at 877.</li>
<li>Resolution (ppi): 213. This is quite high and can be retina-class depending on how far you hold it. The iPad (3) leads with 264 ppi.</li>
<li>Color Gamut (sRGB): 59.6%. This falls short of the iPad's (3) 94.4% and the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1's 67.5%.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>There is something going on with white brightness levels. No doubt ASUS and Google decided to use a high quality LCD in the Nexus 7, but brightness at 312 nits is considerably lower than the competition. Even the higher ppi iPad (3) has a brighter display.</p>
<p>In the previous update Soneira mentioned an image compression issue where bright image content is compressed about 25% making it appear artificially bright. Google and ASUS might have done this intentionally to compensate for the dim LCD.</p>
