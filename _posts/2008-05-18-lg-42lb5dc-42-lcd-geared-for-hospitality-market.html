<p><a href="http://www.lgcommercial.com/downloads/pdf/18283_LG_42LB5DC.pdf">LG</a> (PDF): During the Hospitality Design Expo 2008 that was held in Las Vegas, LG unveiled its 42LB5DC LCD that is geared for the hospitality market. The 42LB5DC is a 42-inch LCD sporting a pixel format of 1920x1080 and featuring a dynamic contrast ratio of 50,000:1, which is excellent. Add to that a motion blur busting 120Hz frequency with deep color capability and you've got a winner. Because the hospitality market requirements are a bit more than just a regular LCD TV that goes into your living, LG has what is called Jack Packs. Jack Packs are boxes that have all the requisite connections to remotely control the 42LB5DC and other hospitality geared LCDs.</p>

<p>Color: Black (RJP-110F), White (RJP-110FW)<br />
