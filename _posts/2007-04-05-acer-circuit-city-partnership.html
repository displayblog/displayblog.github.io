<p class="P2">Acer and Circuity City will partner with Circuit City to begin distribution of Acer-branded LCD monitors in the second quarter of 2007. Acer expects this partnership to boost the company's sales of LCD monitors. This will also benefit those that are manufacturing partners such as Innolux Display, TechView Technology and TPV Technology. LCD panel manufacturers should benefit as well and include AU Optronics (AUO), Chi Mei Optoelectronics (CMO) and Chunghwa Picture Tubes (CPT).</p></p>
<p class="P2">Acer has been in and out of the US market before. Now with a partnership with Circuit City, the #2 retailer in the US after Best Buy, Acer is trying to come back with a big splash. Acer has nine LCD Value Line models with sizes ranging from 15" to 26" and a F-20" Ferrari-branded LCD monitor, pictured below.</p></p>
