<p>Sony announced the N Series notebook PCs on September 13, 2006. The N Series is your typical 15.4&acirc;&euro;&sup3; notebook PC but with a bit more attention given to the design. There are three colors available: black, white, and brown. Now, this isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t the first time brown has been added to the mix, supposedly Microsoft&acirc;&euro;&trade;s new Zune MP3 player has black, white, and brown. Brown is fashionable to wear, but to tote&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll have to see.</p>

<p>The 15.4&acirc;&euro;&sup3; wide screen comes with Sony&acirc;&euro;&trade;s XBRITE-ECO LCD technology, is Windows Vista Premium ready (not Ultimate?), has WiFi 802.11 a/b/g, a DVD+/-R DL/DVD+/-RW/DVD-RAM compatible optical drive and DVgate Plus software. The unit is priced at a nice $999 and will be available in October 2006.</p>
<p>I like the price. I hope there will be screen resolution options to at least 1440 x 900 or preferably 1680 x 1050. The standard screen will most likely be 1280 x 800 resolution with glare. I personally don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t like glare, but that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s just my taste. And for it to give us a decent Vista experience, I hope it has discreet graphics instead of an integrated one.</p>
