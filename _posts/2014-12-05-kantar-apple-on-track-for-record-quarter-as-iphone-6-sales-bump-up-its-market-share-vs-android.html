<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/12/03/kantar-apple-on-track-for-record-quarter-as-iphone-6-sales-bump-up-its-market-share-vs-android/">Ingrid Lunden, TechCrunch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple has been seeing its smartphone market share erode over the last several years as its simple-and-small line up of iPhones competed against model after model of low-priced, big-screened, fancy-featured Android-based handsets. But it looks like its latest iPhone 6 models &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; with their larger faces, 4G compatibility and Apple Pay support &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; may be helping it turn the tide a bit.</blockquote></p>
<p>Lunden uses the latest figures &mdash; the last three months ending on October 31 &mdash; from Kantar Worldpanel. The figures show nine countries and year-over-year changes in the three-month (August, September, October) smartphone operating system sales share. The nine countries are: Germany, Great Britain, France, Italy, Spain, U.S.A., China, Australia, and Japan, in no particular order. For instance in Great Britain, iOS gained 10.4% points from 29.1% in the Aug.-Sep.-Oct. period in 2013 to 39.5% in the same period in 2014. iOS showed gains in Australia too: 35.0% to 40.4% for a gain of 5.4% points.</p>
<p>Sounds good. But doesn't the size of the market matter? For instance, a 1% point gain in China (about 1.4 billion in population) should be way more significant than a 1% point gain in Australia (about 24 million in population). So I did some math and added in the total population &mdash; for simplicity sake &mdash; for each country and then figured out how significant these percentage point changes reported by Kantar and TechCrunch really were. I understand that there are differences among the countries mentioned (wireless infrastructure: overall reach, LTE deployment, cost, monthly payments, discounts, etc., per capita income, smartphone penetration/saturation, smartphone replacement rate, and many other differences), but all I wanted to see was how the size of a country's population impact these numbers that seem to point to Apple turning the tide. The results are quite interesting.</p>
<p>Android, in order of significance:</p>
<ul>
<li>China: +4.8% points &rarr; +65.7 million</li>
<li>Japan: +11.9% &rarr; +15.1M</li>
<li>USA: +1.1% &rarr; +3.5M</li>
<li>Italy: +1.4% &rarr; +851K</li>
<li>France: +0.9% &rarr; +595K</li>
<li>Spain: -1.9% &rarr; -8834K</li>
<li>Australia: -4.1% &rarr; -971K</li>
<li>Great Britain: -2.3% &rarr; -1.5M</li>
<li>Germany: -2.6% &rarr; -2.1M</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>All nine countries combined the percentage points changes from 2013 to 2014 resulted in an addition of about 80 million Android users, primarily because of the relatively small 4.8% point change in China. Now let's look at iOS, also in order of significance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Great Britain: +10.4% points &rarr; +6.7 million</li>
<li>China: +0.2% &rarr; +2.7M</li>
<li>Germany: +3.1% &rarr; +2.5M</li>
<li>France: +3.7% &rarr; +2.4M</li>
<li>USA: +0.7% &rarr; +2.2M</li>
<li>Italy: +3.4% &rarr; +2.1M</li>
<li>Australia: +5.4% &rarr; +1.3M</li>
<li>Spain: +2.3% &rarr; +1.1M</li>
<li>Japan: -13.1% &rarr; -16.6M</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>All nine countries put together iOS added over 4.3M users, despite the relatively large (-13.1% point Y/Y) percentage point decrease in Japan. The percentage point decrease in Japan is quite significant (-16.6 million users) because Japan's population is the third largest (almost 130 million) in this group, after China and the U.S.</p>
<p>Limiting our discussion to just these nine countries that Kantar profiled, Android added significantly (almost 19x more significant using our <em>really</em> simplified model) more users than iOS. So did iPhone 6 sales bump up the share of iOS versus Android? In Great Britain, yes. In China? No, because while iOS added 0.2% points (+2.7 million) Android added 4.8% points (+65.7 million). China is where it matters and Apple didn't bump up its market share there. Japan? No. And in the nine countries as a group? Nope.</p>
