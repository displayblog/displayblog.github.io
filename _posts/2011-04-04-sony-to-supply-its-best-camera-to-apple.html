<p>Sir Howard Stringer <em>via</em> <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2011/04/02/jobs-looms-large-as-stringer-talks-tech/">The Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It &acirc;&euro;&oelig;always puzzles me,&acirc;&euro; he said. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Why would I make Apple the best camera?&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple uses cameras for all of its MacBooks, iMacs, iPhones, monitors and the iPad 2, latest iPod touch. Which one was Stringer referring to? Who knows, but it seems Sony will be supplying Apple with its "best camera". Or that might have changed immediately after Stringer made that comment.</p>
