<p>Sharp's D4 WS016SH UMPC is a slider-type that sports Intel's new Centrino Atom Z520 CPU running at 1.33GHz. The LCD is a 5" sporting a very high pixel format of 1024 x 600 and is touch capable. The D4 has 1GB of RAM and a 40GB HD.</p>
<p>The inevitable needs to happen at this moment: a quick comparison to the Apple iPhone. I do like the simple and elegant operation of the iPhone's touch UI. Apple is touting the iPhone as the next computing platform. But the LCD is a bit lacking with just 480 x 320 pixels. And as of this writing you can't browse to Adobe Flash-enabled websites on the iPhone. The last thing that I would like to mention is the all-screen keyboard: it takes some getting used to, especially if you're used to a real keyboard.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the D4 WS016SH runs Windows Vista. My 3-year old Dell Inspiron 9300 with an upgraded 7200RPM 100GB HD, 2GB of RAM, and the original Pentium M 1.7GHz and every single un-needed software deleted off, HD and registry optimized *pause* barely runs Windows Vista Ultimate adequately. I can't imagine that the Atom running at 1.33GHz with just 1GB RAM and a 40GB HD (most likely a 4200RPM HD) would be sufficiently powerful to run Windows Vista Home Premium quickly, let alone hiccup-free.</p>
<p>But if it does. Wow. That would make the D4 WS016SH a strong contender for that lone computing device vying to replace the notebook PC. The slider format makes for much better design than what Sony's got.</p>

<a href="http://www.akihabaranews.com/en/news-16030-WILLCOM+D4+(Sharp+WS016SH)%2C+exclusive+Review!!!.html">Akihabara News</a> reviewed Sharp's WS016SH UMPC near-final prototype version. </p>

<p>Bear in mind that this little unit runs Microsoft's Vista, which is known to bring fairly capable PCs to a crawl. Akihabara News summarized the Vista performance as such: "...the D4 suffers a little with Vista... and [Vista] is clearly inadequate for running a mini-portable type UMPC." Despite the sluggish performance, Akihabara News is excited about testing the final version, and test it on Windows XP.</p>
