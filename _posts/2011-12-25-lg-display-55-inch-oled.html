<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/12/25/lgs-55-inch-worlds-largest-oled-hdtv-panel-is-official-comi/">Engadget</a>. LG Display press release:</p>
<blockquote><p>The panel adopts an Oxide TFT technology for backplane which is different from a Low Temperature Poly Silicon (LTPS) type generally used in existing small-sized OLED panels. The Oxide TFT type that LG Display utilizes is similar to the existing TFT process, with the simple difference lying in replacing Amorphous Silicon with Oxide. Moreover, the Oxide TFT type produces identical image quality to high performance of LTPS base panels at significantly reduced investment levels.</blockquote></p>
<p>Compared to a-Si electron mobility is improved by a factor of up to 30x on an oxide TFT backplane. This characteristic is required to precisely control current on a large OLED display. Cost is another factor. Even if it was possible to manufacture a 55-inch LTPS backplane it would be too expensive. Oxide TFT improves performance and lowers cost.</p>
<blockquote><p>Additionally, LG Display uses White OLED (WOLED). WOLED vertically accumulates red, green, and blue diodes. With white color light emitting from the diode, it displays screen information through color layers below the TFT base panel, which leads to a lower error rate, higher productivity, and a clearer Ultra Definition screen via the benefits of small pixels. Further, it is possible to realize identical colors in diverse angles via color information displayed through a thin layer.</blockquote></p>
<p>I wish I knew what vertically accumulating RGB diodes means. Maybe it means there are two transparent OLED diode layers with the three primary colors accumulating toward the front of the OLED display, kind of the reverse of what a Foveon X3 image sensor does. Vertical accumulation allows small pixels and "Ultra Definition" (or QuadHD or 4K2K) meaning a pixel format of 3840x2160 or higher. And viewing angles will probably be close to 180 degrees.</p>
<p>Although I'm excited about the possibility of a large OLED TV with deep blacks and an impossibly thin profile (to mount on the wall of course), I'm also concerned about how long it will last. As far as I know blue diode lifetimes are still limited and unlike smartphones we exchange every two or three years we tend to keep our TVs for quite a bit longer especially one that will most likely be very expensive.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> <a href="http://www.lgblog.co.uk/2012/01/world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s-largest-oled-tv-from-lg/">LG Electronics announced</a> its 55-inch OLED TV based on LG Display's panel mentioned above. I'm not terribly excited about the possibility of having to be forced to replace an expensive OLED TV every few years, but here's another reason for my dampened enthusiasm:</p>
<blockquote><p>The 4-Color Pixels feature allows for more accurate color depiction by using a set of four colors (red, green blue and white) in comparison to the RGB setup used by other OLED TV manufacturers.</blockquote></p>
<p>I believe that's code for RGBW PenTile Matrix. And that means the 3840x2160 or higher pixel format isn't exactly that either.</p>
