<p><img class="size-full wp-image-6257 aligncenter" title="nec_multisync_e222w_22_inch_lcd_monitor" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/nec_multisync_e222w_22_inch_lcd_monitor.jpg" alt="nec_multisync_e222w_22_inch_lcd_monitor" width="357" height="299" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20090601005129&amp;newsLang=en">BusinessWire</a>: The NEC 22-inch MultiSync E222W is greener than your average LCD monitor. It isn't totally green since it still uses a CCFL backlight that contains mercury. But the LCD monitor uses half the amount of mercury. Power consumption is down by 50 percent too. My guess is that by improving the optical film stack, light throughput has been enhanced. That allows the number of CCFL tubes to be reduced. In the case of the E222W by half. A LED backlight would have made the E222W a lot more green but that would have meant you'd have to part with more of your greenbacks.</p>
<p>Less power consumption is a good thing in my book but let's hope the picture quality wasn't compromised. The E222W features a 1680 x 1050 pixel format, a 1000:1 contrast ratio and a 5ms response time. You have two ways to connect: DVI and VGA. Price? US$269 in July.</p>
