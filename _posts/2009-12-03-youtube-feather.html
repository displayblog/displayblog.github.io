<p>On December 3, 2009 Google announced <a href="http://www.youtube.com/feather_beta">YouTube Feather</a>, a light (beta) version of YouTube. Loading videos is definitely faster, but some features are gone: rating and commenting. You only see 10 comments. No biggies in my book since most of the time I'm just watching. This is a great move by Google by enhancing the experience of watching movies on YouTube. <a href="http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2009/12/introducing-feather-lighter-way-to.html">YouTube</a> <em>via</em> <a href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/03/youtube-goes-light-as-a-feather/">The New York Times</a></p>
