Wow, that was fast. NVIDIA's GeForce GTX 280 gets a teardown. The folks over at Custom PC took it apart and laid eyes on some huge cooler and heat sink that keeps the massive GPU from melting itself and its surroundings. Custom PC confirms that it is THE fastest GPU on the planet. As of now.</p>

<p>Watch out Intel. You too AMD. NVIDIA is playing hardball and with its latest GPU, the GTX 280. NVIDIA's got a rock-solid knock-out punch with its GTX 280 and below are some incredible details of what it can do.</p>
<p><strong>CUDA Computing Mode</strong>: The CUDA general-purpose parallel processing mode has supercomputing power to simulate realistic, physically accurate effects. With CUDA runtime for Windows Vista, a lot of processing tasks can be offloaded from the CPU to a NVIDIA GPU.</p>

<em>Warrior from NVIDIA Medusa Demo. This looks so real, it looks like a picture to me!</em></p>
<p>According to Vijay Pande, Associate Professor of Chemistry at Stanford University, the GeForce GTX 280 is able to run Folding@Home much faster than the latest 3GHz Core 2 Quad CPU from Intel. 45 TIMES FASTER.</p>
<p>Here's the proof in the pudding according to NVIDIA:<br />
146x faster than CPU for interactive visualization of volumetric white matter connectivity<br />
36x: Ionic placement for molecular dynamics simulation<br />
18x: Transcoding HD video stream to H.264 for portable video<br />
17x: Simulation in Matlab using mex file CUDA function<br />
100x: Astrophysics N-body simulation<br />
149x: Financial simulation of LIBOR model with swaptions<br />
47x: GLAME@lab M-script API for linear Albegra operations on GPU<br />
20x: Ultrasound medical imaging for cancer diagnostics<br />
24x: Highly optimized object oriented molecular dynamics<br />
30x: Cmatch exact string matching - find similar proteins & gene sequences</p>
<p><strong>2nd Generation NVIDIA Unified Architecture</strong>: 50% faster gaming performance compared to the GeForce 8800 Ultra. 240 enhanced processor cores that can pump out to 2560 x 1600 pixels.</p>

<p><strong>3-way NVIDIA SLI Technology</strong>: 3-WAY. NVIDIA claims that its 3-way alternate frame rendering (AFR) as the world's fastest gaming solution under Windows Vista, I can believe it.</p>
<p><strong>NVIDIA PureVideo HD Technology</strong>: HD video decoding is accelerated. Picture clarity, video smoothness, color accuracy, image precision are all enhanced.</p>
