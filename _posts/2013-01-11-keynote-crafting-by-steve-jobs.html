<blockquote><p>Most of the time during those rehearsals, Ken and I had nothing to do except sit in the then empty audience and watch The Master Presenter at work &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; crafting his keynote. What a privilege to be a spectator during that process. At Apple, we were actually all students, not just spectators. When I see <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3850056/qualcomms-insane-ces-2013-keynote-pictures-tweets">other companies clumsily announce products</a> these days, I realize again how much the rest of the world lost now that Steve is gone.</blockquote></p>
<p>Steve Jobs already had a natural talent for public speaking. On top of that he rehearsed, rehearsed, and then rehearsed some more, until the presentation effortlessly flowed out of him. The third element that made Steve Jobs a masterful presenter: He truly believed what he was introducing to the world was absolutely the best.</p>
