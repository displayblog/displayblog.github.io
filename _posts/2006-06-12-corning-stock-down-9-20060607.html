<p>Facts: With <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=auo">AUO</a> reporting that May large-sized LCD panel shipments were down 1.5% from April, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=corning">Corning</a>'s stock price may have been impacted. Roughly two weeks prior to AUO's announcement, Corning forecasted a 5% lower sales for Q2.</p>
<p>Opinion: Any downward movements in panel shipments will impact Corning since Corning is the leading provider of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-glass">LCD glass</a> to major LCD manufacturers such as AUO, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=samsung">Samsung</a> and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lg-display">LPL</a>. However, lower panel shipments does not automatically mean less glass demand due to the industry-wide shift to larger panels such as <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a>s that leads to less units given a constant capacity.</p>
