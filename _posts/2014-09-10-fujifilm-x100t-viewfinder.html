<p>Sam Byford, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/10/6125709/fujifilm-x100t-announcement-price-specs">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It can sometimes be hard to tell precisely what you're focused on when using the optical finder on the X100 and X100S, so Fujifilm is solving the problem by making its cameras work more like a traditional rangefinder than ever. An electronic overlay in the optical view can display a zoomed-in image of the focus point, and the X100T also adjusts for parallax in real time, both of which mean you should have a much better idea of what photo the camera will capture. There isn't really anything else like this on the market &mdash; assuming it performs as claimed, the viewfinder will offer the comfort and response of optical alongside the accuracy and versatility of electronic.</blockquote></p>
<p>A feature all cameras &mdash; including smartphones &mdash; should have.</p>
