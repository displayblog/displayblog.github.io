title: 'DISPLAYBLOG Has Moved From WordPress to Jekyll'
---
<p>DISPLAYBLOG has been down for a few days, but that's nobody's fault but mine. Instead of planning out the transition from WordPress to Jekyll hosted on GitHub Pages, I just pulled the plug on WordPress that was hosted on Media Temple.</p>

<p>Transitioning from WordPress to Jekyll and then hosting on GitHub Pages was not an easy one. I had to learn a great deal of things, which I plan to document on this article.</p>

<strong>WHY???</strong>
<p>Why in the world did I think it was a good idea to change from WordPress to Jekyll? Especially when I've been on WordPress since 2006 and have written over 7000 articles?</p>

<p>Simply put dealing with a database -- mySQL in the case of WordPress -- and PHP was something I no longer wanted. I didn't know what was going on in the database. The phpMyAdmin tool we all get to use to administer remote mySQL databases is a dinosaur: the UI and the UX is simply horrible. The English used in phpMyAdmin could just as well be Greek. Same goes for mySQL and PHP.</p>

<p>The idea that blog posts can be made up of simple text files was alluring enough I tried to transition to Jekyll last year. But I failed, because it was too hard. I tried because I was promised it was going to be easy. Just go to Jekyll and check for yourself: a few commands and you're Jekyll site is up and running. Well, not on my Mac it didn't. I was looking for simplicity, and Jekyll promised it. What ended up happening was a great deal of complexity in initially setting up Jekyll on my Mac, but in the end having simple text files be the actual articles really is something so much more simple than how it was before.</p>

<strong>PERMALINKS</strong>
<p>All permanent hyperlinks unfortunately will be severed. This will have a worldwide impact on any site that has referenced any of the 7000+ articles on DISPLAYBLOG. Apologies to everyone for all those broken links! If anyone knows how to restore WordPress-style permalinks on Jekyll please get in contact with me (jin@displayblog.com). I'll have to go through hundreds of articles to fix hyperlinks that reference other articles on DISPLAYBLOG.

<p><em>Update 2016.12.12</em></p>

<p>I think I've figured out how to restore permalinks I used while on WordPress. The trick was to modify the _config.yml file in the root directory of my Jekyll site. All I had to do was add:</p>

<code>permalink: /:year/:month/:day/:title</code>

<p>This way permalink references no longer reference:</p>

<code>/YYYY/MM/DD/Blog-Post-Title.html</code>

<p>Instead with the _config.yml modification, permalink is referenced without the .html at the end:</p>

<code>/YYYY/MM/DD/Blog-Post-Title/</code>

<p>This should restore all worldwide permalink references to DISPLAYBLOG articles since 2006. Phew.</p>
