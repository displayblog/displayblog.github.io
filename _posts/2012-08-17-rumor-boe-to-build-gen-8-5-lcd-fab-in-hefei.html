<blockquote><p>China-based flat panel maker BOE Technology plans to build up a new 8.5G plant in Hefei with a capital input of CNY28.5 billion (US$4.47 billion). Volume production is slated for the first quarter of 2014, according to industry sources.</blockquote></p>
<p>Expected input capacity is 90,000 substrates per month. BOE is backed by the Chinese government; expect rapid, massive capacity expansion at the expense of market profitability.</p>
