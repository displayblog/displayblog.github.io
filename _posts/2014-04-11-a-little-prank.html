<p><a href="http://donmelton.com/2014/04/10/memories-of-steve/">Don Melton</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>So Steve started the rehearsal, going through slides on the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Switcher&acirc;&euro; ad campaign and then the Apple Stores.</p>
<p>At the end of the retail update, he was supposed to conclude with something like &acirc;&euro;&oelig;1.4 million visitors in the month of December alone,&acirc;&euro; but he added, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;so to all of you in the press who doubted us&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>And then clicked to reveal his special slide &mdash; poster art I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m sure everyone has seen before &mdash; a 1940&acirc;&euro;&trade;s-style rendering of a grinning man holding a big mug of coffee next to his face with this text alongside like a world balloon:</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;How about a nice cup of shut the fuck up.&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>And then the best part &mdash; the part we didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t know was coming &mdash; Steve paused, turned to his V.P. of Marketing and deadpanned, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;What do you think, Phil? Too much?&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
