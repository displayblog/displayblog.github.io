<p><a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/211074/the_tech_brands_you_can_trust.html">PCWorld</a>'s annual reliability survey:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple once again smoked the competition in the desktop, notebook, and smartphone categories, winning high praise from customers in all reliability and service categories. The Macintosh and iPhone maker did so well that virtually all its scores were above average.</blockquote></p>
<p>For <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/211085/2010_reliability_and_service_survey_smartphone_and_wireless_providers.html">smartphones</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple fans love the iPhone, but they're not particularly thrilled with AT&T, which at press time was the exclusive iPhone carrier in the United States. Readers rate AT&T last in voice call quality and data speed, while Verizon Wireless is the overall favorite.</blockquote></p>
<p>Actually there is one thing that AT&T does much better than Verizon: smooth-as-butter financial transactions month-in and month-out, especially when you want to change features.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/211088/2010_reliability_and_service_survey_hdtvs.html">HDTVs</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Panasonic, one of the last plasma TV holdouts, topped a tightly packed group of HDTV manufacturers in our survey, edging out LG and Sony. While Panasonic's support is average, its plasma sets are very reliable and have few serious problems, readers say.</blockquote></p>
<p>I think plasma is the better technology if you enjoy watching sports, action flicks and especially at night.</p>
