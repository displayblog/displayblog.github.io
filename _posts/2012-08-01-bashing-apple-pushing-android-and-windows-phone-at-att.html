<p><a href="http://www.bgr.com/2012/08/01/att-iphone-sales-decrease-managers-orders/">Zach Epstein, BGR</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Regional retail sales managers at AT&T have been instructing store managers to pump the brakes on Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s iPhone. Instructions handed down from corporate state that customers seeking smartphones at AT&T retail stores should be steered away from Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s iPhone and towards Android phones or Windows Phone handsets like the Nokia Lumia 900 instead. BGR has confirmed the directive with three independent sources.</blockquote></p>
<p>AT&T as well as any other company focused on short term profits will respond to market incentives to maximize dollars now rather than later. Maybe Google, Google's hardware partners, Nokia, and Microsoft are providing significant performance-based MDFs to AT&T.</p>
