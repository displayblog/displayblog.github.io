<p><a href="http://www.twice.com/article/465478-Mitsubishi_Downsizes_TV_Ops_Drops_LCD.php">Twice</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mitsubishi Digital Electronics America said Friday that it is restructuring the company through a plan that will see a reduced workforce, and a rededication to the production and sales of a wide range of large-screen visual displays in both its commercial and consumer business units. </p>
<p>In the effort, the company is dropping LCD TVs and will be concentrating on microdisplay rear- and front-projection systems measuring 73 inches and larger.</blockquote></p>
<p>Laser-based rear projection technology is Mitsubishi's competitive edge and focusing on its strength might be the right decision since there are so many me-too LCD TVs in a very competitive market.</p>
