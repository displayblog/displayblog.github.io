<p><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/15/borders-and-kobo-will-develop-new-e-reader/">The New York Times</a>: Amazon was first with its Kindle. Barnes &amp; Noble was next with its Nook. Now it is Borders' turn. Borders is teaming up with Kobo (who is Kobo?) to introduce an ebook reader and ebook store. According to The New York Times, there will be more than one version of the ebook reader, all with wireless connectivity, and sold in Borders bookstores. The duo will focus on ePub formats in the ebook store, making the service hardware neutral. My bet is that the three (Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, Borders) will duke it out while a company that has nothing to do with books will beat them all at their game. Who could that be.</p>
