<blockquote><p>[...] it really is the best Android device available right now.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Nexus S isn't available just yet; it is expected to arrive on T-Mobile on December 16th.</p>
<p>The best Android smartphone has a unique curved 4-inch 800x480 Super AMOLED. And taking a page right out of Apple's marketing tips & tricks, the display is called a <a href="http://www.google.com/nexus/features.html#">Contour Display</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The curved glass screen fits comfortably in the palm of your hand and along the side of your face.</blockquote></p>
<p>It might feel comfortable, but I would keep the Nexus S away from the side of your face (read: <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/12/03/keep-iphone-at-least-15-mm-away-from-the-body/">Keep iPhone at least 15 mm away from the body...</a>).</p>
<blockquote><p>Take Nexus S outside, there's 75% less glare than on other smartphone displays. Your videos, pictures and games look their best and the sun won't wash them out.</blockquote></p>
<p>If true, this plugs one big weakness of OLED displays.</p>
