<p>Viewsonic's N2060w is a 20" wide LCD TV with a pixel format of 1366 x 768. Viewsonic categorizes the N2060w as a desktop display. As a desktop display, it does not have enough pixels for the size. I would much rather spend less money and get more pixels. The N2060w has a 700:1 contrast ratio, 160/140 horizontal/vertical viewing angle, 8ms gray-to-gray (GTG) response time, and a brightness of 450 cd/m2. Inputs include PC, RCA, component, and S-video. Although the specifications seem to say "HD", it only has a NTSC tuner, meaning SD. There are stereo speakers rated at 3W each. Obviously, the N2060w is geared for a child's bedroom, a tiny living room or family room, the kitchen or a massive bathroom.</p>

<p>My thoughts on the 1366 x 768 pixel format is simple: stay away. Everything you see on the LCD will need to be scaled if you're watching video. It doesn't matter what the video source is; there is nothing that is native 1366 x 768. Go for 1280 x 720 if you can find it. I think Westinghouse Digital came out with a 27" LCD TV that has that pixel format, but it's not easy to find. The best thing to do is to go ahead an purchase a nice LCD TV with a pixel format of 1920 x 1080. In this case, at least you will know that 1080i content will not be scaled. Viewsonic's N2060w is priced at $459.00 and you only get it in black.</p>
