<p>[ <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/08/27/thinkpad-x1-yoga-oled-review/">Engadget</a> ] Devindra Hardawar:</p>
<blockquote><p>The X1 Yoga's OLED display doesn't waste any time impressing you. The red border around Lenovo's logo has an almost electric feel upon boot-up, and that carries over to everything in Windows. OLED displays are known for their bold colors and deep black levels, and this one doesn't disappoint. Watching videos and perusing photos is a revelatory experience. OLED adds an enormous amount of depth to images that makes them seem almost three-dimensional.</p>
<p>With a resolution of 2,560 by 1,440 (1440p/2K), the X1 Yoga's OLED screen is significantly sharper than a 1080p display, though it's not quite 4K. That's just fine, though, as Windows 10 still isn't well suited to 4K, and the benefits of such a high resolution are wasted on laptop screens.</blockquote><br />
Bold colors can often mean blown out colors, over-saturated colors, or unnatural colors. With OLED displays the ability to be color calibrated with a hardware&nbsp;calibration tool seems mandatory. Can you imagine how wonderful colors would be on an OLED display if they were accurate?</p>
<p>With a resolution of 210 ppi, 2560x1440 on a 14-inch display is plenty. But to say 4K is wasted on laptop screens? Now that's a stretch. Not one&nbsp;pixel on a theoretical 17-inch MacBook Pro with 3840x2160 (259 ppi) would&nbsp;go wasted.</p>
<blockquote><p>Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the Thinkpad X1's battery life. It lasted only around 4.5 hours during typical usage, and I always had to recharge it in the afternoons. In our battery test, which involves playing an HD video continuously at 50 percent brightness, it lasted 8.5 hours. It's likely just far more efficient at handling video than a plethora of different programs running at once.</blockquote><br />
Not surprising. You get much more battery life when watching videos on an OLED display than a LCD because:&nbsp;Videos overall are generally darker than websites or office applications like Microsoft Office. The darker the screen the less energy is consumed by OLEDs. On the other hand edge-lit LCDs, which are most LCDs, are always on whether or not the content is dark or not. So if you're a movie buff, want to get totally immersed in your movies, and still have some battery leftover, a notebook with an OLED display will not disappoint.</p>
