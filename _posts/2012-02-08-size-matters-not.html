<blockquote><p>Instagram isn't just small; it's tiny. It's miniscule. It is famously located in Twitter's old digs in San Francisco's South Park neighborhood. But here's the thing: Instagram subleases its space from another company. Instagram isn't in Twitter's old office, it's in Twitter's old <em>conference</em> room.</blockquote></p>
