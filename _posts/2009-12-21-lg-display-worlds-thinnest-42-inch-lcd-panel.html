<p>LG Display's 42-inch LCD panel is just 2.6-mm thick (0.1 inch) and sports an edge-lit LED backlight, 120Hz, 1080p and weighs a little under 8.8 pounds. Imagine a large LCD TV that is almost flush with the wall... tantalizing. Of course we'll need the other boxes to become very thin very fast to complement these ultrathin LCD TVs. FYI: A lot of sources, including i4u and Engadget are reporting that LG is the manufacturer. Well, that's quite wrong; although LG produces plasma display panels, it is LG Display that manufactures LCDs.
