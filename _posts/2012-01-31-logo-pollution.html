<p><a href="http://www.minimallyminimal.com/journal/2012/1/24/coffee-time-the-problem-with-logos.html">Andrew Kim</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I hoped that the Lumia 900 would be the phone I have been dreaming about. Then disaster struck. Aside from the issue of its size, it had 3 logos on its face. 3 is 3 too many. The problem with Windows Phone is with its inherent logo pollution. Nokia puts on a logo to say it's their phone. Then at&t slaps one on. Then we also get a horrendous Windows logo.</blockquote></p>
