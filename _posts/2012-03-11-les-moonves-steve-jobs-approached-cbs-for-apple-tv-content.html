<blockquote><p>"I told Steve, 'You know more than me about 99 percent of things but I know more about the television business,' " Moonves said, citing his concerns about providing content to a service that could disrupt CBS' existing revenue streams. Moonves said Jobs, in characteristic fashion, strongly disagreed with his assessment.</blockquote></p>
<p>Unfortunately what Moonves meant was, "I know more about the <em>current</em> television business." But Steve Jobs was talking about a <em>future</em> television business. I don't know when Apple's iTelly will be coming out, but when it does anyone thinking the TV business is business as usual will be left behind.</p>
