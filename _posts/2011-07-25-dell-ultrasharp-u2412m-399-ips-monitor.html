<p><a href="http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&l=en&s=bsd&cs=04&sku=320-2676">Dell</a>: The UltraSharp U2412M is a 24-inch LED-backlit IPS monitor with a pixel format of 1920x1200 priced at just $399.</p>
<p>Specs: 8-ms GTG response time, 1000:1 CR, 300 nits, 178/178 viewing angles, 82% CIE 1976 color gamut. Connections: DVI-D w/HDCP, DisplayPort, VGA, and 4-port USB 2.0.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> <a href="http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/reviews/dell_u2412m.htm">TFT Central</a> reviewed the U2412M:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Dell U2412M utilises an LG.Display LM240WU8-SLA2 e-IPS panel which is capable of producing 16.7 million colours. The panel itself actually uses a 6-bit colour depth with Advanced frame rate control (A-FRC) to produce the 16.7m colours. [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>An 8-bit e-IPS LCD panel would have been better, but also would have cost more.</p>
<blockquote><p>Viewing angles of the Dell U2412M are very good, as you would expect from a screen based on an e-IPS panel. [...] The panel is free from any off-centre contrast shift which you see from VA matrices, and this is why IPS technology is so highly regarded in the colour enthusiast and professional space. It is also free of the very noticeable contrast and colour tone shifts you see from TN Film panels vertically.</blockquote></p>
<p>Serious about color? The only real option is a monitor with an IPS LCD, preferably one with 8 bits.</p>
