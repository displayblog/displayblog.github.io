<p><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/facebook-flaw-allows-access-to-private-photos/64761">Zack Whittaker, ZDNet</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But this flaw is open for anyone to use &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; and abuse. While Facebook anonymises the data that it gets through this reporting tool, the user whose profile pictures can be viewed will not know that their privacy has been invaded.</blockquote></p>
<p>A safe rule of thumb: Never upload photos you'd like to keep private. Good reasons for not having a Facebook account continue to amass.</p>
