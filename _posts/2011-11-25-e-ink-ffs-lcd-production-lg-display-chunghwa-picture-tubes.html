<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20111125PD209.html">DIGITIMES</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>E Ink Holdings (EIH) will suspend a cooperation agreement it signed with LG Display for the production of FFS (fringe field switching) LCD panels and will buy back a sum of corporate bonds (CBs) issued by its Korea-based subsidiary Hydis Technologies from LG Display, according to EIH.</blockquote></p>
<p>FFS, originally developed by Hydis, has performance similar to IPS and has been used in lieu of IPS LCDs. E Ink will manufacture FFS LCD panels at Chunghwa Picture Tubes's (CPT) G6 fab.</p>
