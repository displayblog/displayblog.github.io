<p>Utilization rate at HannStar Display's G5.3 fab is expected to be fully loaded this month (April). The company expects 60-70% M/M growth in unit shipments in March due to rush orders.</p>
<p>Although the company will be focusing half of its resources toward small/medium LCD production, HannStar Display expects to ship 4 million LCD monitors and 700,000 LCD TVs in 2009 according to David Joe.</p>
