<blockquote><p>In the China market, as many as 12 vendors have unveiled 3D LCD TVs ranging from 37 to 55 inches and many of them will launch pricing campaigns to promote their 3D sets in the upcoming May 1 Labor Day sales period, according to industry sources.</blockquote></p>
<p>The 3D premium over non-3D LCD TVs with LED backlights seems will disappear in 2011. No matter what the price, 3D is bad for your eyes.</p>
