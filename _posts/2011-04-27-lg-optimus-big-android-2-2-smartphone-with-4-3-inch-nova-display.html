<p><a href="http://pedia6.uplus.co.kr/promotion/optimusbig/event_main.asp">LG U+</a>: The LG Optimus Big is an Android 2.2 smartphone with a fairly large 4.3-inch TFT LCD dubbed Nova Display. The unique feature of the Nova Display is a brightness of 700 nits. This is <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/04/16/lg-optimus-black-hd/">how LG did it</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ok-Hyun Jeong, Head of MC R&D Center at LG Electronics shared dur&Acirc;&shy;ing the 2011 LG Techno Conference that is going on right now in San Jose, Cali., that the NOVA LCD makes use of the company&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Fine Black Matrix technology, which reduces the thickness of the TFT from 9 microns to 7. Less light blockage means improved light transmittance and that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s how LG is getting to a retina-burning 700 nits of brightness.</blockquote></p>
<p>LG is also touting that the company was able to reduce power consumption by 50% on the Optimus Big. My guess is the higher light transmittance on the Nova Display allows you to do two things. One, use the maximum 700 nits on a sunny day outside. Or two, bring down the brightness to a more reasonable 500 nits and save a lot of power. The display generally consumes the most power on a smartphone so tweaking it leads to some great power savings.</p>
