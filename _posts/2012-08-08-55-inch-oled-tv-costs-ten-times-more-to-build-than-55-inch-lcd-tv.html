<p><a href="http://www.displaysearch.com/cps/rde/xchg/displaysearch/hs.xsl/120808_new_amoled_tv_costs_ten_times_more_than_lcd_tv_to_produce.asp">NPD DisplaySearch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[...] the manufacturing cost of a 55&acirc;&euro; oxide TFT-based AMOLED using white OLED with color filters is 8 times that of a high-end 55&acirc;&euro; TFT LCD display of equal size. The cost multiplier of a 55&acirc;&euro; AMOLED module using red, green, and blue OLED is 10 times. These higher costs are mainly a result of low yields and high materials costs.</blockquote></p>
<p>Samsung makes a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2012/01/12/samsung-55-inch-super-oled-tv/">55-inch OLED TV with RGB OLED</a> while LG makes it with <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2012/01/09/woled/">WOLED</a>. And both will be out of reach for 99% of folks who are thinking of purchasing a TV this year.</p>
