<blockquote><p>The (non-professional) jury is still out on 3D&acirc;&euro;&trade;s health effects. When I spoke to an ophthalmologist for my original review he noted that there is no way to damage your eyes permanently by looking at the 3DS&acirc;&euro;&trade; screen. That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s all well and good, but in today&acirc;&euro;&trade;s litigious and hysterical parenting atmosphere, we are sure to find a few screamers claiming that the 3DS struck their little Rupert blind. If you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re worried, don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t get the 3DS for your kids. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s as simple as that.</blockquote></p>
