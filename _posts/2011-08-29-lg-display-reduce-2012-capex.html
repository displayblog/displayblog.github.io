<p>Jung-ah Lee, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904332804576537622088188308.html">WSJ</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>LG Display said it would spend around three trillion won ($2.8 billion) on facilities next year, down about 33% from its revised budget for this year. A month ago the company cut this year's capital-spending budget to around 4.5 trillion won from 5.5 trillion won.</blockquote></p>
<p>LGD will not be building additional LCD fabs in 2012. The company is responding to lackluster demand for TVs. 3D and smart TVs. The type of TVs only a few are willing to pay the premium for.</p>
