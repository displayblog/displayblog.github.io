<p>Walter Isaacson, <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/How-Steve-Jobs-Love-of-Simplicity-Fueled-A-Design-Revolution-166251016.html"><em>Smithsonian</em></a> magazine, September 2012:</p>
<blockquote><p>Its guiding tenet was simplicity&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not merely the shallow simplicity that comes from an uncluttered look and feel and surface of a product, but the deep simplicity that comes from knowing the essence of every product, the complexities of its engineering and the function of every component. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;It takes a lot of hard work,&acirc;&euro; Jobs said, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;to make something simple, to truly understand the underlying challenges and come up with elegant solutions.&acirc;&euro; As the headline of Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s first marketing brochure proclaimed in 1977, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
