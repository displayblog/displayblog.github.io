<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IOY8XWQ/">Amazon</a>: The Kindle Voyage sports a 16-level grayscale 6-inch display with a resolution of 300 ppi. Here are the main features Amazon is touting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adaptive Light Sensor: Automatic brightness adjustment based on ambient light.</li>
<li>Page Turning: Apply pressure on the bezel to turn the page. No need to click a button or swipe the display, leaving fingerprints.</li>
<li>Thinness: The Kindle Voyage is the thinnest Kindle at 7.6mm.</li><br />
</ul><br />
If you are an avid reader, there is no better display to read on than E Ink. With a backlight that lights up the text (and not your face), page turning that keeps your fingers where they are, and a 300-ppi display the Kindle Voyage seems to be the best e-reader money can buy. Priced at US$199 for the WiFi only version with Special Offers (ads).</p>
