<p>Scientists from the Kavli Institute for Nanoscience and Philips Research Labs were able to develop a light-emitting diode from a single quantum-dot nanowire that may lead to single nanowire based fabrication of optoelectronic nanodevices. The quantum-dot nanowire LED could enable the combination of single-electron transport and single-photon optics. Nanowire based LEDs are more efficient in extracting light compared to traditional planar LEDs. High quality nanowires can be grown affordably based on silicon substrates that could lead to commercial lighting devices. Indium-phosphide and indium-arsenide, which are group III-IV semiconducting materials, make up the nanowire heterostructures. First, nanowires with high crystalline quality structures with controlled diameters are grown using a vapor-liquid-solid mode. Next, a single 30nm by 4 micro-meter nanowire is placed on top of a silica substrate, which is then doped with hydrogen suphide and diethyl-zinc along the wire axis. In the nanowire is produced a pn junction, which is a tiny LED with electron-hole restricted to quantum dot-sized section of the wire. When a voltage is applied to the pn junction, photons are emitted in the infrared range of wavelengths.</p>
