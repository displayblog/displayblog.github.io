<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=samsung">Samsung</a>'s 226CW 22" wide LCD monitor seems to be specially designed for hardcore gamers! The fast response time (2ms GTG), great <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dynamic-contrast">dynamic contrast</a> ratio, and a wide color gamut to boot! There are some downsides though. Note how the viewing angle is at 160/160. This points to the use of a display technology called <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=tn">TN</a> or Twisted Nematic. TN is an older technology than <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=ips">IPS</a> or <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=pva">PVA</a>. But TN has advantages over the other two: generally faster response times and lower price.</p>
<p>Of course most of the time we'll be dead-center looking at the 226CW, so it really doesn't matter. The occasional friend that looks from the side will see something different: the colors will shift resulting in slightly different colors, and both brightness and the contrast ratio will be less when viewed from an angle. </p>
<p>TN requires special optical film to improve the viewing angle to 160-degrees and it usually noted as TN+Film. The improved color gamut should look pretty nice. The source of the improved color gamut is most likely a wide color gamut CCFL (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=wcg-ccfl">WCG-CCFL</a>) that uses improved phosphors on the CCFL tubes.</p>
<p>The dynamic contrast ratio of 3,000:1 is pretty impressive on a 22" <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-monitor">LCD monitor</a> and should yield good images. The 2ms GTG response times are out of this world! For those of you who stay glued to the computer playing games all day (oh I wish I could do that!) will really appreciate the fast response time. On the occasion that you want to watch some HD content, you're taken care of with the DVI connection since it has HDCP.</p>
<p><em>Update...</em></p>
<p>Here is another picture of Samsung's 226CW:</p>

<p>I found this picture at <a href="http://www.samsung.com/ca/products/monitor/lcd_widescreen/ls22mexsfvxaa.as">Samsung's Canada site</a>. You can see a bit more of the external design compared to the first picture. I am a fan of simple and elegant product designs and this one seems to fit the bill, except for the amount of textual information on the front bezel: you have the model name and number on the upper left, some logos on the upper right, and in the lower right section you have text to tell you what the buttons are for and then finally the all-important <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=samsung">Samsung</a> mark. The "neck" of the 226CW doesn't look very sleek as it seems to be slightly on the thick side. I would also have liked a more angular base to match the rest of the design. But all that aside, I think this will be a fantastic <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-monitor">LCD monitor</a>, especially with a 97% NTSC color gamut and fast response times!</p>
