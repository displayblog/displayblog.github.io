<p>A refurbished 7-inch Samsung Galaxy Tab that works on Sprint was going for a steal at $260 on <a href="http://www.woot.com/">Woot</a>. Unfortunately, it has been sold out. I'm certain there will be more deals like this to come since new Galaxy Tabs will be available soon, making the older ones prime target for price cutting.</p>
