<blockquote><p>Next month, Lowe&acirc;&euro;&trade;s will introduce its MyLowes online tool that customers will be able to use to store owner&acirc;&euro;&trade;s manuals, warranties and paint formulas, Chief Information Officer Mike Brown said in an interview. The Mooresville, North Carolina- based company is arming workers with 42,000 iPhone 4s to answer shoppers&acirc;&euro;&trade; questions and ring up purchases.</blockquote></p>
<p>Each Lowe's store will be equipped with about 25 iPhones. Home Depot dispatched Motorola smartphones last year.</p>
