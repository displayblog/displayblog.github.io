<p>People with jailbroken <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=iphone&amp;sa=Search#1348">iPhones</a> who have not changed the default root password be careful. There is a new worm that hijacks your iPhone and tries to steal user information from a particular Dutch bank. The worm also appears capable of creating iPhone-based botnets. I strongly suggest changing the default root password if you have jailbroken your iPhone. Many believe more viruses and worms will target the iPhone in the future.
