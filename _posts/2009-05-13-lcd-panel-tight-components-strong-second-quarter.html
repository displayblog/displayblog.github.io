excerpt: "<strong>Tight Components</strong> LCD panels require a lot of components:
  PCBs, driver ICs, CCFLs, LEDs, optical sheets, liquid crystal, glass, color filter,
  etc. And the supply for components are tight right now. Some LCD manufacturers are
  reporting that they have not been able to deliver on orders they have received 1
  1/2 months ago. In turn there is a LCD panel shortage that is driving up prices.
  This is good news for LCD manufacturers for the short term: LCD panel prices have
  dipped below cash cost levels and recent increases must allow LCD manufacturers
  to make a profit for sustained growth. In the long term LCD suppliers will need
  to gradually increase their utilization rates to match demand and that is what seems
  to be happening right now. If LCD manufacturers wait too long to match supply to
  growing demand, LCD panel prices will continue to increase and will eventually lead
  to price increases in end products such as netbooks, notebook PCs, LCD monitors
  and LCD TVs. If that happens, the more-than-ever price-sensitive consumer will pull
  back. The LCD supplier might enjoy a month or two of increased revenues and profits
  but the dropping demand at the retail end due to price increases will eventually
  make its impact felt through the supply chain. "

<p><strong>Tight Components</strong> LCD panels require a lot of components: PCBs, driver ICs, CCFLs, LEDs, optical sheets, liquid crystal, glass, color filter, etc. And the supply for components are tight right now.

<p><strong>Rising Prices</strong> According to DisplaySearch's PriceWise report all major LCD monitor panel prices posted an increase in early May. The report states that LCD monitor panels are in shortage because of a LCD TV focus by LCD suppliers. There is also growing demand for hybrid LCD monitors that also act as TVs with a built-in tuner. These models hit a low price entry point for 1080p capability. The LCD component shortage does not help either in meeting demand for these panels. LCD TV panel prices also increased quite a bit in early May with 32" (1366 x 768) and 42" (1920 x 1080) increasing US$8 each. Rising prices usually is an indicator that shows there is a supply/demand imbalance; there is pressure on supply to catch up.</p>
