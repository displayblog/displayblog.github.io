<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LOR524M">Amazon</a>: The Fire HD Kids Edition comes in two &mdash; 6 and 7 inches &mdash; display sizes and comes with a two-year guarantee. If the kids break it Amazon will replace it for free. The case looks pretty tough. The 6-inch version is priced at US$149 and the 7-inch version is $189.</p>
