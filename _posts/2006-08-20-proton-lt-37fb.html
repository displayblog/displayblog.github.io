<p>Proton is not a household name in the US market, but it seems the price is right. The LT-37FB is a 37" LCD TV and will be available in the Taiwanese market by the end of August and will retail for NT$54,900 (~US$1,680). The price isn't the cheapest I've seen for a 37" LCD TV, but maybe the Taiwanese market prices are generally a bit higher than those in the US. The LT-37FB uses a LG.Philips LCD panel and has a resolution of 1366 x 768 (mediocre), a brightness of 500 cd/m2 and an average response time of 8ms.</p>

<p>LG.Philips LCD, with Philips possibly out as a shoe-in major customer, will be scrambling to find other brands to sell all of the LCD TV panels that it is churning out. For instance, LPL made a strategic decision to supply Syntax-Brillian with LCD TV panels. I haven't heard of Proton being part of a strategic decision, but LPL has to develop more customers to keep up with Samsung's LCD unit, who has both Samsung and Sony as major captive customers. Sony is 50% captive in their joint venture S-LCD.</p>
