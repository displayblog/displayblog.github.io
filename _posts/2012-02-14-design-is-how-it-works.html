<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/02/walter_isaacson_steve_jobs">John Gruber</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think Jobs meant what he said to Fortune, and it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s an attempt to communicate the same core truth. But &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Design is how it works&acirc;&euro; is a much better statement of Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s philosophy. Talk of a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;product&acirc;&euro;&trade;s essence&acirc;&euro; (Isaacson&acirc;&euro;&trade;s words) or &acirc;&euro;&oelig;the fundamental soul of a man-made creation&acirc;&euro; (Jobs&acirc;&euro;&trade;s) only serves to separate, conceptually, the art of design from the cold hard science of engineering. With just five words, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Design is how it works&acirc;&euro; expresses succinctly and accurately that engineering should and can be part of the art of design.</blockquote></p>
<p>Gruber's take on Walter Isaacson's <em>Steve Jobs</em> is a must read. In it he shares what he believes is the book's biggest hole:</p>
<blockquote><p>Note that my complaints here are not about Isaacson being insufficiently deferential. That the book is not a hagiography is to its credit. The personal stuff &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; documentation of Jobs&acirc;&euro;&trade;s cruelty (and his <em>talent</em> for cruelty), his tantrums, his tendency to claim for himself the ideas of others &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not problematic. Isaacson handles that well, and what he reports in that regard jibes with everything we know about the man. My complaints are about outright technical inaccuracies, and getting the man&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>work</em> wrong. The design process, the resulting products, the centrality of software &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; Isaacson simply misses the boat.</blockquote></p>
