<p>I'm enjoying CES from the comfort of my desk. No flying, getting in a shuttle, checking in at an expensive hotel, waiting in lines, using dirty bathrooms, and buying over-priced food. Instead of posting dozens of individual posts I've culled here a list of interesting display-centric news coming out of Las Vegas on the first day of CES 2013.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/7/3847956/intel-makes-touchscreens-widi-a-requirement-for-next-generation">The Verge</a>: Intel announced 4th generation Core processors, codenamed Haswell, good for all-day computing, but to use those power-sipping CPUs a touch screen and WiDi wireless display technologies are mandatory. WinTel is back, to push Windows 8 hard. I wonder what Apple will do with this requirement.</p>
<p><em>Smartphone</em></p>
<p><a href="http://bgr.com/2013/01/07/alcatel-one-touch-idol-ultra-release-date-283786/">BGR</a>: The Alcatel One Touch Idol Ultra is the world's thinnest smartphone, for now, sporting a svelte profile of 6.45 mm. That's 15% thinner than the 7.6-mm iPhone 5. The Jelly Bean smartphone features a 4.7-inch HD AMOLED display.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.huaweidevice.com/worldwide/newsIndex.do?method=view&newsId=246&directoryId=5024&pageType=news">Huawei</a>: The Huawei Ascend Mate may be the world's largest smartphone with a 6.1-inch LCD, but sporting a ho-hum 1280x720 pixel format.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/7/3845690/vizios-hot-new-1080p-and-720p-stock-android-phones-are-for-china/in/3610341">The Verge</a>: Vizio is re-entering the smartphone market with its VIA Phones. One is a 5-inch sporting 1920x1080 and the other is a 4.7-inch 1280x720. Both sport Jelly Bean, and both are geared for the Chinese market.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/7/3847944/sony-xperia-z-zl-hands-on">The Verge</a>: The flagship Sony Xperia Z is a 5-inch 1920x1080 LCD Jelly Bean smartphone that's IP55 and IP57 dust and water resistant. Looks good except for the power button.</p>
<p><em>Camera</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/2013/01/07/Fujifilm-X100S-retains-retro-styling-but-adds-split-view-focus-on-sensor-phase-detection-and-16MP-X-">DPReview</a>: Fujifilm X100S is the updated X100. The 'S' is for speed thanks to a faster EXR II processor. Fujifilm claims the X100S sports the world's fastest AF. Priced at US$1299 and available in March.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3849692/polaroids-im1836-interchangeable-lens-camera-is-bad">The Verge</a>: The Polaroid iM1836 is a mirror-less interchangeable lens Android camera, and it's awful. US$349, but maybe not cheap enough.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/07/canon-powershot-n-hands-on/">Engadget</a>: The Canon PowerShot N is a tiny squarish point-and-shoot, but what's the point if you're always toting a smartphone.</p>
<p><em>TV</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/07/lg-55-inch-12000/">Engadget</a>: The LG 55-inch OLED TV has been priced at US$12,000 and will be available in March. The 84-inch 4K TV is available now for US$19,999.99 (Source: <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/26/3557648/lg-4k-ultra-high-definition-tv-available-us-price">The Verge</a>)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.panasonic.com/promos/ces/2013/products/viera-televisions.aspx">Panasonic</a> is focused on making blacks blacker on its plasma TVs. There's no OLED or 4K LCD.</p>
<p><a href="http://gizmodo.com/5973693/spendthrift-darling-vizio-enters-4k-tv-fray">Gizmodo</a>: Vizio announced its XVT series of 4K LCD TVs and comes in 55-, 65-, and 70-inch sizes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsavitz/2013/01/07/ces-samsung-unveils-4k-tvs-upgrades-smart-tv-service/">Forbes</a>: Samsung showcased its 4K LCD TVs in six sizes: 60, 65, 75, 85, 95, and 110 inches. But no mention of its F9500 55-inch OLED TV's pricing or availability.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/7/3845586/sony-4k-oled-tv-confirmed">The Verge</a>: Sony unveiled a 56-inch 4K OLED TV prototype. Commercially available 4Ks were LCDs in two sizes: 55 and 65 inches (Source: <a http://ces.cnet.com/8301-34451_1-57562620/sony-ces-press-conference-heavy-on-4k-tvs-oled-plus-an-actual-phone/">c|net</a>).</p>
<p><em>Tablet</em></p>
<p><a href="http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/press/2013/53589">Acer</a> announced its Iconia B1-A71 7-inch 1024x600 Jelly Bean tablet with a price around US$150.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mobileindustryreview.com/2013/01/lenovos-27-tablet-is-a-smart-idea-costs-1000-and-is-due-this-summer.html">Mobile Industry News</a>: The Lenovo IdeaCentre Horizon is a 27-inch tablet. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/01/07/lenovo-27-inch-tablet">John Gruber</a> says it best: "This is nuts."</p>
