<blockquote><p>Organizing documents based on their app is akin to organizing notes based on the pencil you used to write them.</blockquote></p>
<p>This is a tough one. We're in an app-centric world and we need to get to a task-centric one. Now if I wanted to work on my resume, the first thing I do is load up Pages. If I wanted to update Corning's quarterly results I'd first run Numbers. I'm trying to imagine how it would look if the opposite was true.</p>
<p>What if extensions were completely gone and all I had to do was double-click on the document. I'd use only the tools I need depending on what I wanted to do with the document. Those tools could be Pages tools or Excel tools or Photoshop tools. I think I like the idea. How would this look on iOS?</p>
