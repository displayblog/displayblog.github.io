<blockquote><p>I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m surprised at how few people know about this. Refurbished hardware, especially factory refurbished, is actually BETTER than new. Not only will you save money, but you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll get a piece that went back to a special lab, probably though no hardware fault (most are returns for other reasons). At this lab, every piece of equipment gets special scrutiny and attention. Quality control at the original factory is pretty good, but QC at the refurb bench is excellent.</blockquote><br />
The 17-inch MacBook Pro that I am using today was factory refurbished by Apple, saved me money, and has been running without a problem since the fall of 2009. This is what I tell my friends: whatever was going to break broke, the company fixed it, and is giving you a discount for the privilege.</p>
