<p>I was introduced to Buy Dakota (Dakota International Trading) last week from a friend. Dakota is a clearing house for returned merchandise that have been refurbished. They also sell some new gear as well. I was looking through what they had to offer and came across the <a href="http://www.buydakota.com/product_info.php?cPath=1_28&amp;products_id=554">Vizio L32HDTV for just $399.95</a>. Now that's a bargain!</p>
