<p>Jason Snell at <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/160858/2011/06/hp_touchpad_first_look.html">MacWorld</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sometimes I think one of the most important achievements of Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s iOS development team is completely overlooked by most reviewers: the fact that on iOS devices, when you move your finger, the on-screen objects under your finger move along with it. No lag, no judder of dropped frames, just a pure illusion that you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re physically manipulating an object. Almost every time I have tried a new Android phone or tablet&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and when I tried the TouchPad&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I am surprised to find that the interface just isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t as responsive as Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s.</blockquote></p>
<p>Imagine text appearing a split second after you press the key on your keyboard. Or if the mouse pointer moved, not as you were moving your mouse, but a little later. That experience would drive anyone mad and would be unacceptable on a modern computer.</p>
<p>And here is HP, one of the largest high-tech companies in the world, with complete control over its hardware and operating system, not able to get this right, and trying to hawk its not-fully-baked TouchPad for $500. Maybe HP isn't as good as I thought at copying Apple.</p>
<p>Snell's conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p>For now, the TouchPad is just another iPad competitor that can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t measure up.</blockquote></p>
