<p>iriver's SPINN is one of the best designed PMP (portable media player) that I have seen. It has a beautiful external casing with a unique control method: a cylinder you twirl; push down the cylindar and you have a click. The SPINN also has a 3.3" AMOLED (Active Matrix OLED) that provides a visual experience that no LCD can match. The pixel format is at a respectable 480 x 272 (same as the Sony PSP). What is truly amazing is that you can get the 4GB SPINN for just US$139.99 at Newegg.com!
