<p>Sharp Electronics Sdn Bhd, Sharp's Malaysian subsidiary, will increase production of LCD TVs to 30,000 units per month by the end of the year, a 50% increase from a current capacity of 20,000 units. The Johor-based plant will serve the growing Malaysian market and will be part of Sharp's plan to capture 30% of the market, an increase of 10%. Worldwide LCD TV production for Sharp will be 22 million in 2006 when its second Kameyama LCD plant (G8) becomes operational in September.</p>
