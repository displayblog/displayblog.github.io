<p>[ <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/11/6/9679740/motorola-droid-turbo-2-review-specs">The Verge</a> ] Jacob Kastrenakes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Motorola isn't lying when it says this screen can't be shattered. In my week with the phone, I've dropped it down flights of stairs, let it fall out of my pocket and onto the sidewalk time and again, and knocked it off of tables, chairs, and desks, all without sending a crack rippling across it. By all means, my Turbo 2 should be a mess &mdash; I've put it through more knocks and spills in a week than most phones will receive over two years &mdash; but its screen remains in impressive shape.</blockquote><br />
Shatterproof does not mean unbreakable, but it does mean if you have butterfingers the Motorola Droid Turbo 2 should be at the top of your replacement smartphone list. Of course, you can simply put&nbsp;a thick shockproof case on your phone for a lot less. But it would also look less pretty.</p>
