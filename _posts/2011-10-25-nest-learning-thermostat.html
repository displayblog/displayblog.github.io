<p><a href="http://www.nest.com">Nest</a> is a thermostat with Apple DNA developed by Tony Fadell. Potentially cut 20% to 30% of your US$1000 annual energy bill. Priced at $249, and get your money back in savings in one year. Looks good, too.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> <em>via</em> <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2011/12/marco-nest/">Ben Brooks</a>. <a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/12/17/nest-incompatibility-without-c-wire">Marco Arment</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The problem arises when the Nest needs to charge itself and neither the heat nor air conditioning has turned on in a while, like on a mild day. Without a C circuit to take power from, it can <em>only</em> charge itself from running the system.</p>
<p>So it pulses the R-W heat circuit in short bursts to get power.</blockquote></p>
<p>Brooks:</p>
<blockquote><p>This isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t likely something that will directly cause a problem, but it is putting unneeded wear and strain on your heating system &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; no way I would allow this.</blockquote></p>
<p>If you have a boiler that reacts instantly, like the one Arment has, these short bursts can also be annoying. I would suggest Nest take a look at solar-powered Casio watches for Nest version two.</p>
<p><em>Update 2:</em> <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/334">Nest teardown</a>. I think the LCD is a square; the cover glass makes it look circular.</p>
