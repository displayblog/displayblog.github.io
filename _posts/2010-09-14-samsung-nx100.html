<p>Samsung's NX100 is a more compact NX10. Samsung has managed to pack an APS-C CMOS image sensor into a very svelte body. I'm not sure how it compares to Sony's NEX-5 but my guess is the two will be hotly compared. Probably just as small, if not smaller, than the Micro Four Thirds cameras from Olympus and Panasonic, the NX100 and Sony's NEX-5 pack larger image sensors. I'm thinking APS-C in tiny packages is the future. Micro Four Thirds cameras will need to get even smaller. Here's a very brief comparison of the NX100 to the NEX-5:</p>
<p>The NEX-5 sports a 14.2MP Exmor APS HD CMOS image sensor. The NX100 is a 14.6MP shooter, a bit more pixels than the NEX-5, but limits video recording to 720p, in H.264. The NEX-5 is 1080/60i capable in AVCHD. The NX100 has an ISO range of 100 to 3200 that can boosted to 6400. The NEX-5 has a range of 200 to 12800.</p>
<p>The NX100 has an optional GPS10 module that geo-tags. A unique feature of the NX100 is the new i-Function lens system that lets you scroll through and change manual settings such as shutter speed, aperture, exposure, white balance, and ISO. The folks at Samsung took what Canon did with its S90/S95 and supercharged it. Typically, Samsung works with Schneider for its lenses, not so here it seems. The NX100 uses SD/SDHC cards. The similarity of the naming conventions is interesting: NX vs. NEX.</p>
