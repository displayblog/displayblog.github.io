<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/4/11/5605874/amazon-will-announce-a-smartphone-by-june">The Verge</a>: This rumor has been going around for quite some time: Amazon is making a smartphone. Today's rumor has a little something special: by using four front-facing cameras Amazon's smartphone will track your eyes for hologram-like 3D visual experiences. Didn't 3D &mdash; with the exception of some feature films at some movie theaters &mdash; die already?</p>
