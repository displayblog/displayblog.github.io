<p>Gene Munster, a Piper Jaffray analyst, on <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/gene-munster-android-based-tablets-will-beat-out-apples-ipad-2010-10">Business Insider</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As in the smartphone market currently, we believe Google&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Android OS will power the stiffest competition to Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s iPad. Long term, we believe Android could surpass the iPad in tablet market share due to devices from numerous manufacturers.</blockquote></p>
<p>From what I've seen of Windows Phone 7, if Microsoft decides to re-enter the tablet market using its WP7 OS I think it will give serious competition not to Apple but to Android. The same hardware guys are in both camps and it seems Microsoft is doing a much better job of providing a good, consistent experience. <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/10/android-tablets-will-beat-ipad/?intcid=postnav">Wired</a></p>
