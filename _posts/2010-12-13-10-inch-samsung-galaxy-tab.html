<p><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/13/microsoft-to-announce-new-slates-targeting-ipad/">The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Samsung device is described as &acirc;&euro;&oelig;similar in size and shape to the Apple iPad, although it is not as thin. It also includes a unique and slick keyboard that slides out from below for easy typing.&acirc;&euro;¬ù</blockquote></p>
<p>It is not as thin, compared to the current iPad. My guess is that it will look fat, compared to the next iPad. Why so fat? A slide-out keyboard. Better hope it has a trackpad because the 10-inch Samsung Galaxy Tab will be running Windows 7 in landscape mode according to this source. In portrait mode, with the keyboard not sticking out, the iPad competitor will have another user interface on top of Windows 7.</p>
<p>Windows 7. Slide-out keyboard. In a tablet about 10 inches? We'll see how much competition the 10-inch Samsung Galaxy Tab brings to the iPad, but I'm not holding my breath. Microsoft is expected to announce iPad-competitive Windows tablets during CES 2011.</p>
