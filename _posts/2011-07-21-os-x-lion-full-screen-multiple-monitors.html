<blockquote><p>I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve also been told full-screen view doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t work, or doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t work well, with multiple-monitor setups; I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m still researching that.</blockquote></p>
<p>I would be surprised if Full Screen worked well on multiple monitors. Those two concepts are oxymoronic to me. Anyone with a multi-monitor setup wants to see a bunch of stuff at the same time. A Full Screen'ed app? A waste of valuable screen real estate. It would probably drive him nuts.</p>
