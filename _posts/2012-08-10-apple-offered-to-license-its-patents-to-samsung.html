<p><a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120810/breaking-apple-offered-to-license-its-patents-to-samsung-for-30-per-smartphone-40-per-tablet/">Ina Fried, AllThingsD</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple executives have testified the company was &acirc;&euro;&oelig;shocked&acirc;&euro;¬ù when Samsung debuted its first Galaxy phones. But, considering the Korean company was a major supplier, Apple apparently was also willing to make a deal with its rival.</p>
<p>In October 2010, Apple offered to license its portfolio of patents to Samsung provided the Korean company was willing to pay on the order of $30 per smartphone and $40 per tablet.</blockquote></p>
<p>Samsung should have taken the deal. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/10/3234693/apple-patent-director-copycats-patents-samsung-trial">Bryan Bishop, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cupertino's user experience patents are another matter altogether &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; both for better and for worse. "You don't really need a license for this," he told the court. "From our perspective, unless you&acirc;&euro;&tilde;re trying to build an iPhone knockoff or clone, or an iPad clone, you wouldn't need a license to this set of IP." If someone is interested, however, Apple's proprietary nature kicks in. "We strongly desire not to license it... We do so with rare exception, consciously knowing we're enabling somebody to not build a clone of it."</blockquote></p>
<p>It was probably a once-in-a-lifetime golden opportunity for Samsung.</p>
