<p>Both PDP-607HX and PDP-427HXD plasma TVs sport 1366 x 768 resolution. What a shame. In the world of 1920 x 1080 resolutions, what is 1366 x 768? Every type of content under the sun will need to be scaled and scaling means the video is just a tad bit less than ideal.</p>

<p>On to better stuff: New P.U.R.E. Black Panel and New P.U.R.E. Drive II. Yes, these are new. The Black Panel allows for higher contrast and the Drive II is a new video processor that makes the video look better. The PDP-607HX, the 60&acirc;&euro;&sup3; plasma TV, will be priced around $6,770 in October while the 42&acirc;&euro;&sup3; PDP-427HXD didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have a MSRP, but will be available at the end of September. IMO, the 60&acirc;&euro;&sup3; unit seems quite a bit overpriced for a resolution-limited plasma TV at such a large size.</p>
