<p><a href="http://displayblog.com/2016/08/25/amzn-tv24/">Click here for a brief description about DISPLAYBLOG&rsquo;s AMZN.TV24 market research</a>. Apologies for this article going up so late. I wanted to build some additional analysis models for Samsung -- where I compare Samsung to the average -- and that took more time than I expected. So without further ado let's get right into analyzing Samsung.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>4K vs. 1080p</strong></p><br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26880" src="http://displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/AMZNTV24_20160901_Samsung4Kvs1080p.jpg" alt="AMZN.TV24 2016.09.01 Samsung 4K vs 1080p" width="590" height="398" /></p>
<p>Samsung is pushing 4K over 1080p by a large margin. Although the 4K trend seems to be a slight downward trend since August 4th the gap between 4K and 1080p is quite large: 75% vs. 25% as of today. So how does this compare to the average?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Samsung's 4K Share vs. Average</strong></p><br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26881" src="http://displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/AMZNTV24_20160901_Samsung4KvsAVG.jpg" alt="AMZN.TV24 2016.09.01 Samsung 4K Share vs AVG" width="590" height="398" /></p>
<p>I adjusted the y-axis minimum to 40% so the ups and downs of Samsung's 4K trend is more exaggerated but they represent the same data as are in the first chart. Compared to the average Samsung's 4K share is significantly higher. Samsung is definitely pushing 4K TVs more than the rest of the brands that show up on Amazon's front search result page.</p>
<p>Next let's find out what Samsung's premium is. I can't delineate whether the premium is from the brand, additional features, fancy materials in the design, etc. but what the data is showing is that for whatever reason Samsung does have a significant premium over the average.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Samsung Price Premium Over Average - 55-inch 4K</strong></p><br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26882" src="http://displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/AMZNTV24_20160901_SamsungASPPremium554K.jpg" alt="AMZN.TV24 2016.09.01 Samsung ASP Premium 554K" width="590" height="398" /></p>
<p>As you can see Samsung's average 55-inch 4K prices are higher -- $221 higher today -- than the overall average. This does not necessarily mean Samsung is more expensive than the other brands -- there might actually be a price premium for the Samsung brand -- but what it <em>does</em> mean is that Samsung is manufacturing and marketing&nbsp;higher ASP 55-inch 4K TVs than the other brands.</p>
<p>I hope that was helpful in understanding Samsung on the front search result page at Amazon. Tomorrow I'll share some insights about VIZIO.</p>
