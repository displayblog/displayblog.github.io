<p>Sony has a deep relationship with Samsung called S-LCD that manufactures LCD panels. The G7 fabs are (there are two) optimized for manufacturing 40" (and that's why you see a lot of Samsung and Sony 40" LCD TVs). According to the latest news, Sony and Samsung has decided to go forth with a G8 fab and will cost many billions of dollars. So, it's a little interesting that Sony has continued to introduce PDPs. The KDE-W50A12U is a 50" PDP with a 1366 x 768 pixel format (so this can handle real HD signals without having to scale too much), a HDMI port, and ATSC tuner. The kicker is the price at more than $8000, which is probably a bit too costly.</p>
<p>According to Trusted Reviews, the KDE-W50A12U is the last plasma TV that Sony is going to build. Sony recently announced that it will no longer participate in making and selling plasma TVs.</p>
