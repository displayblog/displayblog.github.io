<p><a href="http://www.cctv.com/program/bizchina/20061220/100343.shtml">CCTV</a>: According to China's Ministry of Information Industry (MII), China manufactured 7.12 million LCD TVs in the first ten months of 2006, which is an 124% increase from the same period in 2005. The 7.12 million LCD TVs accounted for 9.7% of the total output of color TVs, up 5.3% from 2005. A total of 73.25 million color TVs were manufactured from January through October 2005. Rear projection TVs (RPTVs) rose 31%, while plasma display panel (PDP) TVs decreased 15.4%. With all display technologies combined, China was the world's largest manufacturer of color TVs with over 50% of the world's color TVs.</p>
<p>This no surprise at all since China has continued to consolidate the world's manufacturing capability for all kinds of electronics. Although Chinese labor has continued to increase, the cost of labor is extremely cheap relative to anywhere else in the world. With infrastructure developments such as reliable transportation, water and electricity, China will continue to become the manufacturing center for most anything.</p>
