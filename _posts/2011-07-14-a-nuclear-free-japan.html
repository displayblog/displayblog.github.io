<p>Japan Prime Minister Naoto Kan <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T110713005486.htm">The Daily Yomiuri</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I will aim to make the country not dependent on nuclear power. I will lower the nation's dependence on it in stages and try to achieve a society that can function without nuclear power in the future.</blockquote></p>
<p>There has been much criticism for Kan not laying out specific plans. From what I can see Kan has shared a vision for Japan's future. Strategy as well as specific plans will be discussed, eventually. I'm in full support of Kan's vision for a nuclear-free Japan.</p>
