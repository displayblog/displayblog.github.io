  LCD monitor</a> sporting a 23.6\" TN TFT LCD with a 1920 x 1080 pixel format.
  In other words the VX2433wm is a 23.6\" <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=1080p+lcd+monitor&amp;sa=Search#1548\">1080p
  LCD monitor</a>. Contrast ratio is good at 1000:1. ViewSonic puts out a dynamic
  contrast ratio figure of 20,000:1 but that's just marketing fluff. Brightness at
  300 cd/m2 is pretty bright.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Limited
  Viewing Angles</strong> The fact that this is a TN LCD panel bears out in the
  limited viewing angles: 170/160. But look a little closer and the viewing angles
  are rated at a minimum contrast ratio of 5:1. Most LCD panels are rated with a minimum
  contrast ratio that is twice that at 10:1. So what does this mean? The viewing angles
  will be much worse than 170/160; I'm guessing it'll be closer to 160/140,
  which is quite bad.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Fast</strong>
  Response times are pretty quick on this 23.6\" LCD monitor at 2ms gray-to-gray and
  5ms on/off. Now gray-to-gray numbers are important if you watch a lot of videos.
  The on/off response time is important for office-type work where pixels usually
  changes from black to white to black. "

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Limited Viewing Angles</strong> The fact that this is a TN LCD panel bears out in the limited viewing angles: 170/160. But look a little closer and the viewing angles are rated at a minimum contrast ratio of 5:1. Most LCD panels are rated with a minimum contrast ratio that is twice that at 10:1. So what does this mean? The viewing angles will be much worse than 170/160; I'm guessing it'll be closer to 160/140, which is quite bad.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Fast</strong> Response times are pretty quick on this 23.6" LCD monitor at 2ms gray-to-gray and 5ms on/off. Now gray-to-gray numbers are important if you watch a lot of videos. The on/off response time is important for office-type work where pixels usually changes from black to white to black. <a id="more"></a><a id="more-5865"></a></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>2 Digital Connections</strong> DVI-D with HDCP, HDMI and VGA connections are available but I recommend connecting via a digital connection if possible. A digital connection from a PC yields much crisper text than via the analog VGA connection.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Low Power</strong> Power Consumption is rated at 45W. There is an Eco Mode that reduces the typical power consumption to 37W in the 'optimize' setting and further down to just 30W in the 'conserve' setting. In standby mode the VX2433wm is rated to consume 2W or less. The 23.6-incher is Energy Star compliant.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Good Price</strong> You can only tilt the VX2433wm. And like most other LCD monitors it is quite thick at 2.5" or 62.3mm. The price is on the affordable side for a 23.6" LCD monitor: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001O9EUSO?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=displ0f-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B001O9EUSO">Amazon has priced it at US$276.47</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=displ0f-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B001O9EUSO" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> as of this writing.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Troubleshooting</strong> I like to view reviews (lots and lots of them) before I purchase a product. So I took a look at the reviews for the VX2433wm. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Freview%2FB001O9EUSO%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref%255F%3Ddp%255Ftop%255Fcm%255Fcr%255Facr%255Ftxt%26showViewpoints%3D1&amp;tag=displ0f-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">There were 7 of them on Amazon</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=displ0f-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />. Four gave 5 stars. One gave it 2 stars and he had trouble syncing the LCD monitor with the graphics card. My opinion is to use a DVI-to-DVI connection and set the pixel format to 1920 x 1080, which can be an unusual setting with PCs that are a few years old. I would also make sure to update the drivers for your graphics card. Also if you're using Ubuntu or Fedora (two Linux flavors), a user shares that setting the monitor to 1920 x 1080 is not possible.&Acirc;&nbsp; If you're an XP or Vista user you should be fine. If you're a Mac user, just plug it in and it should work.</p></p>
