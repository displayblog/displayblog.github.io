<p>[ <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/apple-vp-the-fbi-wants-to-roll-back-safeguards-that-keep-us-a-step-ahead-of-criminals/2016/03/06/cceb0622-e3d1-11e5-a6f3-21ccdbc5f74e_story.html">The Washington Post</a> ] Senior Vice President of Software Engineering at Apple Craig Federighi:</p>
<blockquote><p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so disappointing that the FBI, Justice Department and others in law enforcement are pressing us to turn back the clock to a less-secure time and less-secure technologies. They have suggested that the safeguards of iOS 7 were good enough and that we should simply go back to the security standards of 2013. But the security of iOS 7, while cutting-edge at the time, has since been breached by hackers. What&rsquo;s worse, some of their methods have been productized and are now available for sale to attackers who are less skilled but often more malicious.</blockquote></p>
<p>The FBI, the Department of Justice, and other law enforcement organizations think it's okay for iPhone users to have security that can be easily hacked. That's messed up.</p>
