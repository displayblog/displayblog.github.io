  2008.08.22 1:04AM PST</strong> Thanks to Phil who sent in word that LG Display
  is the supplier of the S-IPS panel with the model number LM240WU4. You can find
  the specifications on the LM240WU4 in LG Display's catalog (<a href=\"http://www.lgphilips-lcd.com/homeContain/jsp/download.jsp?fileName=LG_Philips_LCD.PDF\">PDF</a>).
  Interestingly, at the time of this posting, LG Display doesn't have the information
  up on its website.\r\n\r\n<strong>Update 2008.08.15 2:59PM PST</strong> Thanks
  to Mark for informing me that HP's LP2480zx is the 24\" LCD monitor with a 10-bit
  IPS panel and LED backlight. The LP2475w is also a 24\" LCD monitor but has a 8-bit
  IPS panel with a CCFL backlight. The following text about 10-bit and the LED backlight
  refers to the LP2480ZX.\r\n\r\n10-bit LCD. It might not sound like it is that big
  of a deal compared to an 8-bit LCD. But it definitely is. 8-bit LCDs can generate
  16 million colors (256 x 256 x 256 for RGB). Increase that to 10-bit and we're talking
  an exponential increase to more than 1 BILLION colors (1024 x 1024 x 1024 for RGB).
  So you've got one billion colors to choose from. Not only that, with a <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led-backlight\">LED
  backlight</a> the DreamColor <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">LP2475w
  LP2480zx generates a color gamut of <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">102%
  133% NTSC so the one billion colors shown in a pixel format of <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1200\">1920
  x 1200</a> are all brilliant. To enhance the color gamut to this level, I am
  assuming the LED backlight is of the RGB variety. <span style=\"text-decoration:
  line-through;\">But the incredible thing is that you get all of this for an unbelievably
  low price of just $649! (Well you don't get the 10-bit LCD panel or the LED backlight,
  but the price is still pretty good as street prices will most likely be quite a
  bit less.) The LP2475w seems like a definite winner! But I do have a question. "

But I do have a question. <a id="more"></a><a id="more-2277"></a></p>
<p>The only question that I have is the type of LCD panel that is used. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/06/10/hp-dreamcolor-lp2480zx-24-lcd-monitor/">HP's LP2480ZX</a>, the high-end DreamColor <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=24">24"</a> LCD monitor, sports a 10-bit <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=ips">IPS</a> TFT LCD panel with a 178/178 viewing angle and a 133% NTSC color gamut. In my opinion IPS is king when it comes to color fidelity. Of course, there is a price to pay. The LP2480zx is north of $3000. So, does the LP2475w sport an IPS panel or not? Let me know if you know...&Acirc;&nbsp; The panel is S-IPS (source: <a href="http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/uk/en/sm/WF06a/382087-382087-64283-444767-444767-3648442.html">HP</a>).</p>
<p>Full press release:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>HP Brings DreamColor Accuracy to Mobile Power Users</strong><br />
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 11, 2008</p>
<p>Today at SIGGRAPH 2008, HP expanded its DreamColor technology portfolio with the introduction of a powerful mobile workstation &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; the HP EliteBook 8730w Mobile Workstation with DreamColor Display &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; that offers professionals exceptional color accuracy.</p>
<p>In addition, HP introduced the HP EliteBook 8530w Mobile Workstation, the HP EliteBook 8530p Notebook PC, a customer calibration kit for the now-shipping DreamColor LP2480zx Professional Display, and two additional high-performance displays to meet the demands of a new generation of visual computing customers.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Mobility is becoming increasingly important to our most demanding, power-user customers,&acirc;&euro; said Stephen Dewitt, senior vice president, Personal Systems Group &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Americas, HP. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;HP is delivering on creative professionals&acirc;&euro;&trade; most exacting computing needs by enabling power users to take their highly tuned graphics workstations with them wherever they go.&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p><strong>Mobile workstations for the ultimate creative professional</strong></p>
<p>Designed for the most sophisticated graphic-intensive applications, the new HP EliteBook 8730w is the only mobile workstation on the market to offer a 17-inch diagonal HP DreamColor Display, which offers over 16 million colors, a significant improvement to the 260,000 available colors on traditional notebook PCs. The notebook also offers an Intel&Acirc;&reg; quad-core processor,(1) 8 gigabytes (GB) of memory(2) and NVIDIA&acirc;&euro;&trade;s next generation of Quadro FX cards with up to 1 GB dedicated video memory.</p>
<p>The HP EliteBook 8530w and HP EliteBook 8530p add professional graphics capabilities in a convenient mobile format, making the notebooks ideal for extreme power users in fields such as animation, video production, broadcasting, photography, design and engineering. Both systems include a 15.4-inch diagonal display, Intel CoreTM 2 Duo processor(1) and 8 GB of memory.(2) Additionally, HP EliteBook 8530w supports Intel quad-core mobile processors.(1)</p>
<p>Incorporating the latest mobile technologies and engineered to meet multiple durability tests, the EliteBook series features the HP DuraCase, a visually appealing, brushed anodized aluminum exterior combined with a magnesium alloy chassis designed for maximum protection to keep the PC looking good, longer.</p>
<p><strong>Delivering on DreamColor display technology</strong></p>
<p>The HP DreamColor LP2480zx Display, the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s first affordable, color-critical display, was developed through a first-of-its-kind technology collaboration between HP and DreamWorks Animation SKG. The 24-inch diagonal HP DreamColor liquid crystal display (LCD) provides a range of more than 1 billion colors in a 30-bit, LED-backlit widescreen display.</p>
<p>The new HP DreamColor Advanced Profiling Solution, now shipping as an option, allows users of the HP DreamColor LP2480zx Display to custom calibrate color settings beyond the built-in factory pre-sets. The solution includes a customized DreamColor colorimeter and calibration software.</p>
<p>The DreamColor Display becomes even more powerful when combined with the new generation of 30-bit graphics accelerator cards &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; such as the ATI FireGL&acirc;&bdquo;&cent; V7700 &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; for the most advanced application performance and visualization beyond 3D. The ATI FireGL V7700 delivers true 30-bit color, enabling never-before-achieved color palette ranges. When the display is combined with a 30-bit card, the user can both generate and display content using the full pallet of more than 1 billion colors, providing unrivaled color accuracy and the smoothest color transitions.</p>

<p><strong>About HP</strong></p>
<p>HP focuses on simplifying technology experiences for all of its customers &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; from individual consumers to the largest businesses. With a portfolio that spans printing, personal computing, software, services and IT infrastructure, HP is among the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s largest IT companies, with revenue totaling $110.4 billion for the four fiscal quarters ended April 30, 2008.

<p>(1) Dual/Quad Core is a new technology designed to improve performance of certain software products. Not all customers or software applications will necessarily benefit from use of this technology. 64-bit computing on Intel architecture requires a computer system with a processor, chipset, BIOS, operating system, device drivers and applications enabled for Intel 64 architecture. Processors will not operate (including 32-bit operation) without an Intel 64 architecture-enabled BIOS. Performance will vary depending on hardware and software configurations. More information is available at http://www.intel.com/info/em64t.</p>
<p>(2) Maximum memory capacities assume 64-bit operating systems. Microsoft Windows XP (32-bit) supports 4 GB (with Microsoft 32-bit, the amount of usable memory will be dependent upon system configuration. It may be less than 4 GB); 32-bit Linux can support up to 8 GB.</p>
<p>(3) All specifications represent the typical specifications provided by HP&acirc;&euro;&trade;s component manufacturers; actual performance may be higher or lower.</p>
<p>(4) Estimated U.S. list prices. Actual prices may vary.</blockquote><br />
