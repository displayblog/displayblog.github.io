<p><a href="http://www.jamesshelley.net/2012/01/what-is-writing">James Shelley</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It brings to mind the words of German novelist Thomas Mann: &acirc;&euro;&oelig;A writer is somebody for whom writing is more difficult than it is for other people.&acirc;&euro;¬ù</blockquote></p>
<p>I <em>must</em> be a writer; transferring what's in my head into the written word exactly as it was in my head is excruciatingly difficult. Most times it's impossible. It's hard because the stuff in the head gets mixed up with stuff from the heart. And often there are no words to describe stuff of the heart.</p>
