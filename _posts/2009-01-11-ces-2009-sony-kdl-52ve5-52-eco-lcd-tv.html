The KDL-52VE5 sports a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=52"">52"</a> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=pva">PVA</a> TFT LCD, a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a> pixel format and has a doubled-up frequency of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=120hz">120Hz</a> to reduce motion blur.

<p>The HCFL backlight reduces power consumption of the KDL-52VE5 by about 40% compared to a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=52"-lcd-tv">52" LCD TV</a> with a CCFL backlight. The KDL-52VE5 also has a what is called Sony's Presence Sensor by automatically turning off the TV when no one is present around the TV after a user-set timeframe. When the Presence Sensor detects motion the TV turns itself back on instantly. An ambient light sensor is integrated to automatically adjust the backlight depending on the brightness of the room and can save energy and improve contrast. I would imagine Sony is working hard on a version with a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led-backlight">LED backlight</a>.</p>
