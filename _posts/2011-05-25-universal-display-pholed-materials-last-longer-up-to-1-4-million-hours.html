<p><a href="http://www.oled-info.com/udc-pholed-material-performance-update-green-now-reaches-14-million-hours">OLED-Info</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Universal Display has quietly released a new PHOLED material performance chart. Their Green-Yellow material now has 1.4 million lifetime hours (LT50), and their Red color offers 900,000 hours. Blue is still very challenging, and their light blue offers only 20,000 hours (LT50).</blockquote></p>
<p>20,000 hours to half brightness for the blue OLED phosphor might not be a problem at all, in the context of mobile phone displays. Consider that most mobile phone contracts are two years. If you had your OLED mobile phone on 24 hours a day the blue OLED phosphor would continue to be fairly bright for 833 days.</p>
