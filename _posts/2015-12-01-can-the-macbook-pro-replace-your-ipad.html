<blockquote><p>If you have certain very specifically-defined workflows, and a work environment where you can guarantee yourself a chair and desk, you can probably get your work done on a MacBook Pro. For the rest of the world, there's iPad.</p>
<p>[Editor's note: The original title for this piece was "If journalists reviewed Macs like iPads".]</blockquote><br />
In <a href="http://displayblog.com/2015/11/30/how-fast-is-the-ipad-pro/">How Fast is the iPad Pro?</a> I shared how&nbsp;my iPhone 6s + iMovie combo was significantly faster at rendering a 50-minute 720p video than a MacBook Pro + Final Cut Pro X combo. I'm talking 10 minutes versus 3 hours significant.</p>
