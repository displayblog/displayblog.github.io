<p><a href="http://www.oled-info.com/korean-researchers-develop-new-transparent-transistors-oled-displays">OLED-Info</a> is reporting that ETRI (Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute), based in Daejeon, South Korea, has developed... you'll need to sit back and take a deep breath: an oxide transistor that can be used for a very stable light modulator that enhances the aperture ratio of an AMOLED (Active Matrix OLED). Phew.</p>
<p>So what does that mean? It means a few things. Brighter AMOLEDs or the same brightness but using less energy. Using less energy in the case of an AMOLED can be directly linked to longer lifetimes, which has been a big challenge. It can also mean better colors. Of course, it can mean all of the above.</p>
<p>ETRI stated that it used an atomic layer deposition process that significantly enhances operational stability with excellent electronic and optical qualities.</p>
