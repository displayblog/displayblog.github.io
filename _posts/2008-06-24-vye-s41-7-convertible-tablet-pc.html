<p>During my recent trip to Las Vegas for the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=infocomm-2008">InfoComm 2008</a> conference, I realized how nice it would be to have a very small and light notebook PC but one that I can type on with ease and can take notes on as well. During meetings, the note taking capability would come in really handy while at other times the full capability of importing pictures, connecting to the Internet and posting articles would be near perfect. My endless search has brought me to the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=vye">VYE</a> S41.</p>
<p>The S41 is a convertible tablet PC that is just 1.28" thick and weighs 2.76lbs. This little wonder also has a DVD burner, built-in. The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=7"">7"</a> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=touch">touch</a> TFT LCD sports a pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1024-x-600">1024 x 600</a>, which is perfect for browsing the Internet and blog posting. The multi-card reader supports a variety of formats that should allow for most shutterbugs to import their pictures without problems. And if you happen to use a digital camera that uses memory card that is not supported, you can connect via USB: there are two USB 2.0 ports so go ahead you can use your mouse too.</p>
<p>All of this starting at $1499.00 makes the VYE S41 a very strong contender for those who need full-blown computing functionality without breaking your back or the bank.</p>
