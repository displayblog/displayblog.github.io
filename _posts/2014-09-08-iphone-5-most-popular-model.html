<p>Dave Hoch, <a href="http://info.localytics.com/blog/iphone-5-and-ipad-2-still-dominates">Localytics</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The iPhone 5, launched in 2012, is Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s most popular phone with a 27% share, but only leads its successor, the 5s, by a small (2%) margin. This is likely because most iPhones come with a cheaper price if the consumer locks into a two-year contract, putting the average consumer on a two-year upgrade cycle. With the new iPhones expected to be available for purchase later this month, the iPhone 6 will likely eat into the iPhone 5&acirc;&euro;&trade;s market share.</blockquote></p>
<p>iPhone upgrade patterns will probably become less cyclical as many of the cellular carriers in the U.S. have moved away from two-year contracts to a) paying off the cost of the iPhone and other smartphones in two years <em>via</em> monthly payments, and b) yearly upgrade programs. For those who are paying of their iPhones on a monthly basis, it will be psychologically more palatable to pay off the remaining balance of the iPhone early &mdash; to upgrade to the iPhone 6 &mdash; than to pay an ETF.</p>
<p>Many iPhone 5 users who have two-year contracts that expire around the time Apple makes the iPhone 6 available will upgrade to the iPhone 6. Although I am not thrilled with the industrial design of the iPhone 6 &mdash; assuming <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/09/06/iphone-6-video-of-working-device-leaked/">the leaks</a> are true &mdash; there is that lure of NFC-based payments using nothing other than the iPhone 6.</p>
