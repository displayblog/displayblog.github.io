<p><a href="http://om.co/2012/04/05/the-of-course-principle-of-design/">Om Malik</a> on Christian Lindholm's of-course principle of design:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most companies (including web startups), he said, are looking to &acirc;&euro;&oelig;wow&acirc;&euro; with their products, when in reality what they should be looking for is an &acirc;&euro;&oelig;&acirc;&euro;&tilde;of course&acirc;&euro;&trade; reaction from their users.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
