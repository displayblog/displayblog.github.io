<p><a href="http://tracks.ranea.org/post/31538696331/iconic">Watts Martin, Coyote Tracks</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>You can look at a computer or a tablet or a phone being used in a coffee shop and you can immediately tell <em>Apple</em> or <em>not Apple</em> even if you can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t see the logo. And this is virtually unique in their industry: you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll usually need the logo to know exactly what the <em>not Apple</em> product is.</blockquote></p>
