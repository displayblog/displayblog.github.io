<p>John C. Dvorak, <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2461557,00.asp">PCMag</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The long-term success of the iTime (or whatever it gets called) will be similar. If it can't replace the iPhone completely it's a goner.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-should-pull-the-plug-on-the-iphone">Dvorak also recommended Apple pull the plug on the iPhone</a>.</p>
