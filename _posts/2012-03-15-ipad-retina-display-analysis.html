<p><a href="http://www.displaymate.com/iPad_ShootOut_1.htm">Raymond Soneira</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Much to my delight the display is its flagship and number one marketing feature. Tablets, after all, are essentially large portable displays so a top notch display is the key to a successful product &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; something most manufacturers haven&acirc;&euro;&trade;t figured out yet. Apple has from day 1 &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; and the new iPad display is impressive &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Apple calls it &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Resolutionary.&acirc;&euro;¬ù This article will be a combination of objective praise and critical analysis of the Retina Display on the new iPad.</blockquote></p>
