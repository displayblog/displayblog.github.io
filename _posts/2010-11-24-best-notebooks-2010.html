Just make sure the display is top-notch quality because you'll be looking at it for hours and hours. The visual experience really does make a difference in productivity as well as entertainment.</p>
<p>From my personal experience Dell has one of the best displays with its 1920x1200 RGB LED backlight LCDs in its 17-inch Precision Mobile Workstations. A close second are the 15.4-inch and 17-inch MacBook Pros.</p>
