<blockquote><p>In terms of brightness, unfortunately I do not have precision instruments in my possession to measure it. However, the 8470p was somewhat brighter than my previous <a href="http://shopping1.hp.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/WW-USSMBPublicStore-Site/en_US/-/USD/ViewStandardCatalog-Browse?CatalogCategoryID=N8kQ7hab..4AAAEvKmAEHGoN">HP 2560p</a>, with slightly better viewing angles as well. The screen also exhibited good overall uniformity in terms of brightness, with no blooming or dark areas experienced. As with every Elitebook, the screen is a matte finish, with no overt reflections to annoy you in brighter areas.</blockquote></p>
