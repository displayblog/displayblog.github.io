  drives on this MBPs for a while. First off is the availability of a matte (non-glare)
  option on the LCD (for $50). I don't like glare and I'm sure there are many out
  there who don't as well. But $50? That sounds a bit expensive to me. The option
  should be free.\r\n\r\nThe viewing angles are 140/120. Although that doesn't
  sound too impressive typical LCDs that are used for notebook PCs are worse than
  that at around 90/50. Contrast ratio of 700:1 is excellent and is much better
  than the typical 500:1 that you see. 60% greater color gamut amounts to 72% NTSC
  since average notebook PC LCDs sport a 45% NTSC color gamut. A 72% NTSC color gamut
  is what you see in typical LCD monitors and LCD TVs. I'm sure the 17\" MBP will
  look fantastic compared to other notebook PCs."

<p>Just looking at the display of the 17" MBP tells you that this is a notebook PC that was designed with the professional in mind: professionals who require portable computing but a very good display too. The display is powered by a hybrid GPU design that we first saw on the 15" MBP. The hybrid GPU design incorporates two NVIDIA GPUs: the integrated GeForce 9400M for normal and power saving operations and the discrete GeForce 9600M GT with 512MB for when you need more graphics power. The 9400M will save you 1 hour of batter life and let you keep going for 8 hours while the more powerful 9600M GT will last you 7 hours. Not bad.</p>
<p>Speaking of battery life, Apple decided to increase the battery size and get rid of all the enclosures and mechanisms for a removable. Apple has a pretty interesting video up on its website. Although the battery is not removable I do applaud Apple for thinking out of the box and getting the battery life up to 8 hours, which is a big improvement compared to the previous generation 17" MBP of just 4-5 hours. That being said there are other companies such as Dell that has improved battery life to significantly more than 8 hours so Apple still has a ways to go. I look forward to a 24 hour battery life in 2010 for the 17" MBP.</p>
