<p>Hitachi has increased the pixel format to an amazing 480 x 800 in a small 2.9" LCD. A couple of sources (<a href="http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20061227/125955/">Techon</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/12/27/hitachi-does-800-x-480-display-for-phones/">Engadget</a>) incorrectly states that it is a 800 x 480, but looking at where the connections are (column drivers) it is definitely a portrait display. Of course, you can simply put it on its side and claim that it's a 800 x 480 pixel format. The problem with that is the refreshes will be clumsy. Not a very important point, but here's what really is important: IPS. Yes, this 2.9" LCD has IPS technology. What does that mean? Colors will be great as will be viewing angles.</p>

<p>Anyway, Hitachi's development of this crazy high resolution display will allow for some media-rich services as soon as mobile phones come equipped so many pixels. I would like to see the next generation iPod sport one of these high-tech marvels.</p>
