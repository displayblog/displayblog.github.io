<p>On December 22, 2008, Taiwan's LCD company stocks increased after China announced that it would purchase $2 billion worth of Taiwanese LCDs in 2009 to support the global economy. The announcement was made during the 4th cross-strait economic and cultural forum that was held in China with Taiwan. Shares of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=au-optronics">AU Optronics</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=auo">AUO</a>) increased 4.54% while <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=chi-mei-optoelectronics">Chi Mei Optoelectronics</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=cmo">CMO</a>) saw its shares go up 6.9%. China accounts for roughly 15% of AUO's LCD TV panel shipments. CMO also expects its LCD TV panel shipments to China to increase 10-15% Q/Q in Q4'08. One of the reason for such optimism is due to China selecting CMO as a supplier to a Chinese government program to increase penetration of electronic products in rural areas of China. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=chunghwa-picture-tubes">Chunhwa Picture Tubes</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=cpt">CPT</a>) also saw its share prices increase by its daily limit; shares for <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=hannstar">HannStar</a> Display (HSD) also went up 6.01%. Taiwanese LCD suppliers were previously expected to supply China with 5 million LCD panels totalling $1 billion in 2009. Now that number has doubled thanks to the Chinese government.</p>
