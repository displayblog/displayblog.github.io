<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/07/12/apple-has-it-wrong">John Gruber</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s post-PC vision isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t about input devices &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; mice, keyboards, pens, whatever. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s about exposed complexity.</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple simplified and the result is less complexity. Windows 8 is still complex, just like Windows 7, but Metro covers it. That's the difference between post-PC and PC plus.</p>
<p>This plus suffix reminds me of the idiotic term &ldquo;<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/05/25/hp-number-one-plus/">number one plus</a>&rdquo;.</p>
