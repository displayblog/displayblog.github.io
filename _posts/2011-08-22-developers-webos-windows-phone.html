<p>Microsoft's Brandon Watson, in a letter to 500+ webOS developers who responded to his <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/BrandonWatson/status/104681012000337920">tweet</a>, <em>via</em> <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20110822/from-webos-to-windows-phone/">AllThingsD</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>First things first. Thank you so much for reaching out to the Windows Phone team to signal your interest in bringing your talents to our platform. To be honest, we didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t expect this level of response, so we were caught a bit flatfooted.</blockquote></p>
<p>I'm sure Microsoft is happy. Nokia, too.</p>
