<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-4024 aligncenter" title="lg_display_47_1080p_lcd_panel_modular_type_led_backlight" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/lg_display_47_1080p_lcd_panel_modular_type_led_backlight.jpg" alt="lg_display_47_1080p_lcd_panel_modular_type_led_backlight" width="500" height="350" /></p></p>
<p>Yes the title is a mouthful! <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lg-display">LG Display</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lpl">LPL</a>) showcased the world's slimmest <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=47"">47"</a><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1080p"> 1080p</a> LCD TV incorporating a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led-backlight">LED backlight</a> and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=local-dimming">local dimming</a> technology. How slim is it? 8.9mm. That is VERY slim! But let's make sure we know exactly why this LCD panel is so special.</p>
<p>Most ultra-thin LCD TV panels that incorporate a LED backlight does not make use of local dimming technology. The reason is that the LED backlight is actually edge-lit. Edge-lit LED backlights, as far as I know, cannot make use of local dimming. So this 47" LCD panel with a LED backlight and local dimming is quite special and extremely thin. So how did LPL do it?&Acirc;&nbsp;LPL incorporated a new backlight system called a "modular LED backlight".</p>
<p>The LCD panel is of the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=ips">IPS</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=in-plane-switching">In-Plane Switching</a>) variety so you get excellent color fidelity. Other features include a brightness of 500 cd/m2, a color gamut of 80% NTSC, and a 6ms (MPRT: Motion Picture Response Time) response time. Availability of this ultra-thin 47" LCD TV panel is unknown but I sure do hope it gets incorporated into new LCD TVs sooner than later.</p>
