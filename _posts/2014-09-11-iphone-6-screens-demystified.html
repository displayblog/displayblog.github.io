<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/09/11/iphone-6-displays">John Gruber</a>. <a href="http://www.paintcodeapp.com/news/iphone-6-screens-demystified">PaintCode</a>: Although the iPhone 6 Plus has an industry standard pixel format of 1920x1080 (landscape mode), an additional step (1.15 downsampling) is needed to render point-based pixels into physical pixels. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/09/08/5-5-inch-iphone-6-3x/">2208x1242 would have been a perfect 3x display</a>.</p>
