<blockquote><p>... Google TV feels like an incomplete jumble of good ideas only half-realized, an unoptimized box of possibility that suffers under the weight of its own ambition and seemingly rushed holiday deadline. Had Google simply focused on a few key features ... we'd have readily excused the missing pieces with the assumption that they'd soon arrive in an equally polished way. Indeed, the most disappointing thing about Google TV is the immediate realization that it could be so much more if only Google given itself some more time.</blockquote></p>
<p>I don't think tweeting while watching TV is a good idea, polished or not. Read <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/10/28/google-tv-twitter-demo/"><em>Google TV Twitter Demo</em></a>.</p>
