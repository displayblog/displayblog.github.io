<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/02/22/lg-optimus-4x-hd-unveiled-quad-core-tegra-3-ice-cream-sandwich/">Richard Lawler, Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This 4.7-inch beast will hit Europe in the second quarter and is its first to feature a 1.5GHz quad-core Tegra 3 as its benchmark destroying CPU, a 4.7-inch True HD IPS LCD (1280x720) plus what appears to be a lightly customized version of Ice Cream Sandwich.</blockquote></p>
<p>I can guess something else that'll be destroyed: battery life. The 4-PLUS-1 CPU actually has five cores with one called Battery Saver Core earmarked for lightweight duty. But the folks who can't wait to get one of these are precisely the folks who will take full advantage of all four of those regular cores.</p>
<p>The 1280x720 True HD IPS LCD should be quite nice and the resolution despite the large display remains Retina level at 312 ppi. But 4.7 inches is getting close to stepping off the cliff of one-handed usability. I guess LG already did with its 5-inch <a href="/2012/02/08/lg-optimus-vu/">Optimus Vu</a>.</p>
