<p>That's why the Apple Store in Beijing closed. <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/10/beijing-apple-store-closes-after-scalpers-buy-30-iphones-at-a-time/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+GearFactor+%28Blog+-+Gadget+Lab+%28Gear+Factor%29%29">Wired</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple closed its Beijing store Wednesday after crowds rushed it to load up on iPhones. Previously, there was a two-per-customer limit on iPhone 4s, which Apple incautiously abolished. The store was overrun with &acirc;&euro;&oelig;scalpers&acirc;&euro;¬ù, buying up to 30 handsets at a time &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; with stacks of cash &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; to sell on at a profit. According to Chinese blog MIC Gadget, the scalpers were selling these phones right outside the doors of the Apple Store.<br />
