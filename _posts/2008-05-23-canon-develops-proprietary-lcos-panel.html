<p>On May 20, 2008, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=canon">Canon</a> announced the development of its own Liquid Crystal on Silicon (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcos">LCoS</a>) reflective LCD panel. Canon will be showcasing its LCoS panel at InfoComm 2008 that will be held at the Las Vegas Convention Center from June 18 to 20.</p>
<p>Canon developed two sizes. One has a diagonal of 0.71" and a pixel format of 1920 x 1200. With that kind of pixel format it is obvious that the 0.71" LCoS panel would be geared toward business <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=front-projection">projection</a> systems. The 0.55" panel has a pixel format of 1400 x 1050 and is geared toward the mid-range projection system market. These LCoS panels are coupled with Canon's proprietary Aspectual Illumination System (AISYS) optical engine that optimizes LCoS panel performance according to Canon.</p>
<p>The interest in front projection seems to be growing as rear projection applications continue to decrease. Remember <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2007/12/27/sony-discontinues-rear-projection-tv/">Sony exiting the North American market</a> for SXRD-based <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=rear-projection-tv">rear projection TV</a>s. This is an unfortunate trend as the most energy efficient way to put up a large display is via projection.</p>
