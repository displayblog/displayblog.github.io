<blockquote><p>The screen has a good amount of brightness but lacks a bit of contrast, especially when compared to the screen of the MacBook. You have a switch for low and high brightness settings, again, under the hatch. Installing the USB driver is simple and &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; for those who only need an additional screen &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s enough. If you want the touch functionality you need to install more stuff. Then you need to calibrate the touchscreen by pressing points for certain amount of time.</blockquote></p>
<p>An old implementation of resistive technology. The 10.1-inch LCD sports a 1024x600 pixel format, 350 cd/m2 of brightness and a 400:1 contrast ratio. Unfortunately, the Monster Touch does not recognize gestures. For US$260 it might seem affordable but you should think to yourself whether or not you really need touch. If you do, consider an iPad with <a href="http://avatron.com/apps/air-display/">AirDisplay</a> instead.</p>
