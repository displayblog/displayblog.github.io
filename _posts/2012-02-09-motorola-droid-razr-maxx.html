<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/9/2783617/motorola-droid-razr-maxx-review">Nilay Patel, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unfortunately, the other thing you're still looking at is the RAZR's miserable 4.3-inch PenTile qHD display. [...] Text looks jaggy, whites shift to blue when viewed off-axis, and the whole thing generally feels like the concession to thinness that it is. I'm not a huge fan of the 720p Super AMOLED PenTile display on the Galaxy Nexus either, but it's head and shoulders above the RAZR and RAZR Maxx. Motorola would have been far better off using the extra thickness of the Maxx to accommodate a better display &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; yes, the Maxx's battery will run all day, but you're not going to want to look at the screen for nearly that long.</blockquote></p>
<p>The display sucks, but what's surprising is a LTE smartphone running all day. You know what that means. <a href="http://www.splatf.com/2012/02/link-patel-droidrazrmaxx/">Dan Frommer</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s safe to say we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll see the first LTE iPhones this year.</blockquote></p>
