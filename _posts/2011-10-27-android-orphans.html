<p><a href="http://theunderstatement.com/post/11982112928/android-orphans-visualizing-a-sad-history-of-support">Michael Degusta, the understatement</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The announcement that Nexus One users won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be getting upgraded to Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich led some to justifiably question Google&acirc;&euro;&trade;s support of their devices. I look at it a little differently: Nexus One owners are lucky. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve been researching the history of OS updates on Android phones and Nexus One users have fared much, much better than most Android buyers.</blockquote></p>
<p>The result of Degusta's research is an incredible chart detailing orphaned Android smartphones.</p>
