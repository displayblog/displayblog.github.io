<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/26/yamaha-pdx-31-ipod-iphone-speaker-dock-too-sexy-for-your-90s/">Engadget</a>: The PDX-31 from Yamaha is an iPod/iPhone speaker dock using Apple's 30-pin dock connector. 3.25-inch speakers pump out your tunes and a remote control comes along for the ride. I really appreciate the minimalist approach to design: the singular focus on music with the all-encompassing color-matched mesh up front.</p>

<p>Apple took a gander at one of these with its iPod Hi-Fi. It also had a similar design. I think it would have faired better if it was introduced today and with color options for the front speaker cover. The iPod Hi-Fi was aimed at folks who could appreciate music but weren't willing to deal with all the clutter. But at US$350 it was too expensive for us regular folk.</p>
<p>The PDX-31 comes in light gray, dark red, and black, but for just $169.95. Buy it at this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046RE01I?ie=UTF8&tag=displ0f-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0046RE01I">Amazon</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=displ0f-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0046RE01I" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> link and I'll get a small kickback.</p>
