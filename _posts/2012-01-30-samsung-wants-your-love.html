<p><a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120130/samsungs-marketing-chief-aims-to-stir-passion-for-koreas-electronics-giant/">Ina Fried, AllThingsD</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As head of marketing for the Korean electronics maker, Lee said she wants to figure out &acirc;&euro;&oelig;how I can engage with consumers from the bottom of their heart, and not just be a big and functional and rational and reasonable brand.&acirc;&euro;¬ù</p>
<p>Lee, who worked for cosmetics brands L&acirc;&euro;&trade;Oreal and Lancome before joining Samsung four and a half years ago, said she wants consumers to love Samsung, to be obsessed with the company and its products.</blockquote></p>
<p>First, stop making <a href="http://youtu.be/vOSgfvTC35A?hd=1">stupid commercials</a>. Second, stop copying. Third, be curious about what makes people tick and work with world class people like Lee Clow who has a deep understanding of  people. Follow those three steps and I think Samsung should get rolling in the right direction. As for love, try not to be too desperate, it isn't attractive.</p>
