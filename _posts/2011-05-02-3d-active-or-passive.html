<blockquote><p>A conclusion however, is that a tilting function and correct placement are more important for a passive eye-glass 3DTV.</blockquote></p>
<p>What this means is that you need to be still when you have passive 3D glasses on, like LG's Filmed Patterned Retarder (FPR) passive 3D technology. Interestingly LG has been touting that you could lay down and watch 3D with its FPR technology. Maybe you can enjoy 3D lying down, but with a bit of cross-talk.</p>
<blockquote><p>The centre luminance of white is about 3 times lower on an active eye-glass 3DTV compared to the passive eye-glass 3DTV due to the different transmittance of the eye-glasses.</blockquote></p>
<p>In regular speak: for the best 3D experience with your active shutter system make sure the curtains are down and all lights are off. Make the room as dark as possible.</p>
<blockquote><p>The passive eye-glass 3DTV must sacrifice vertical resolution in order to show the images for each eye with different polarization. A passive eye-glass 3DTV with (1920 x 1080) will thus only have a measured resolution in 3D-mode of (1920 x 540) for each eye where an active eye-glass type 3DTV will have (1920 x 1080) for each eye.</blockquote></p>
<p>Full HD? That seems to be mere marketing. You're getting half-Full HD with passive 3D technology. Here's my conclusion: 3D sucks. Either you mess up your eyes watching Full HD 3D with active shutter glasses in complete darkness or experience less than Full HD 3D with passive, messing up your eyes a little less. I choose neither.</p>
