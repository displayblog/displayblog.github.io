<p>With Firmware 03 on the Sony NEX you can customize two soft keys B (lower) and C (middle). Menus loop too. For a complete list of all the changes hop on over to <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/1010/10101104sonyfirmwareimpressions.asp">DPReview</a>.</p>
<p>I've been having fun taking photos and capturing videos with my NEX-5 for the last three weeks. I must say I keep it at Intelligent Auto most of the time with superb results. The only times when I had to fiddle with the shooting mode was when I experimented with the auto-panorama feature, which worked like a charm.</p>
