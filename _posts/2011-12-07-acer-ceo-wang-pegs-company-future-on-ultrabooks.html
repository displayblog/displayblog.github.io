<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20111207/acer-ceo-were-going-to-stop-selling-cheap-unprofitable-crap/">John Paczkowski</a>. Acer CEO J. T. Wang:</p>
<blockquote><p>We will shift our strategy to improving profitability from pursuing market share blindly with cheap and unprofitable products. Ultrabooks will become our key growth driver next year as customers want a lighter, thinner notebook with longer battery life. Selling more ultrabooks will also help improve our profit margins as they command higher prices.</blockquote></p>
<p>The strategy to improve profitability. Well that says it all. Acer still doesn't get it. Most businesses don't. A business if it wants to make money should not focus on making money but focus on people. If Acer had paid close attention it would have been crystal clear people want a lighter notebook, a thinner notebook, a notebook with longer battery life. This has <em>always</em> been the case the moment the first portable computer was made.</p>
<p>I think we've advanced quite a bit in the areas of thin and light. Future versions of the MacBook Air as well as other ultrabooks will certainly continue to be thinner and lighter but I think what we'll see in the next couple of years we've already seen most of. Battery life will continue to get better not because of significant advances in battery technology but because of semiconductors that do more with less. The next step is to get all day 10 - 12 hour battery life on a wickedly fast sliver of aluminum.</p>
<p>But there are two, more important challenges. One, to use Apple's lineup of MacBooks, is to cram a 13.3-inch display into a 11.6-inch chassis, a 15.4-inch display into a 13.3-inch chassis, and a 17-inch display into a 15.4-inch chassis. And at the same time squeeze quadruple the number of pixels into existing displays. For example the 1440x900 pixel format on the 13.3-inch MacBook Air would double horizontally and vertically to 2880x1800, and this Retina-ized display would sport thin enough bezels to fit into a 11.6-inch chassis. I think this is where we're going with the next generation of thin, light, all day battery powered notebooks.</p>
