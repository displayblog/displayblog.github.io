<blockquote><p>We found only <strong>one country</strong> where Android accounts for more than 50% of the mobile web traffic, which is also the only country where Android is the leading mobile OS.</blockquote></p>
<p>That would be South Korea.</p>
<blockquote><p>Note that South Korea is the home country of Samsung, and their Android phones have clearly been very successful there.</blockquote></p>
<p>And that would be the Samsung Galaxy S.</p>
