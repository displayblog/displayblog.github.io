<p>Project Ara is Google's attempt to upend the smartphone industry by making smartphones modular. Want your smartphone to take better photos in low light environments? If Project Ara is successful you might be able to choose from several companies. How about the most important component in a smartphone, the display? Imagine getting to pick the size and pixel format you want: a 5.5-inch 1920x1080 OLED display module by Samsung or an equivalent IPS LCD module by LG Display. Tough call. And when these companies upgrade their displays you won't be forced to spend several hundred dollars buying a new smartphone just to get the better display.</p>
<p>If only I could combine the rumored <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/04/22/lg-g3/">5.5-inch 2560x1440 LCD on the LG G3</a> with the camera from the Sony Xperia Z2 that <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/04/11/sony-xperia-z2-the-best-camera-on-a-smartphone/">DxOMark tested best on a smartphone</a>. That'd be fantastic.</p>
