<p>This is something that is contrary to what is Dell. Dell does not create new categories. Dell is not at the leading edge of design. Dell caters to the masses and not a niche market. Well, throw all that out because Dell has announced "The Showstopper", a 20" wide 1680 x 1050 pixel format ~20 lbs luggable notebook PC-like monster. The 20" is most likely supplied by LG.Philips LCD. The specifications are pretty impressive:</p>
<p>Up to 2.16GHz Intel Core Duo CPU<br />
Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005<br />
Up to 4GB of dual-channel DDR2 RAM (667MHz)<br />
ATI Mobility Radeon X1800 GPU w/256MB<br />
Up to 240GB of HDD with optional RAID 0-1<br />
8x DVD/CD optical drive</p>
<p>And then some. For full specifications, click <a href="http://www.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/xpsnb_m2010?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;~section=specs#tabtop">here</a>.</p>
<p>There are a couple problems here. 17" notebook PCs have 1920 x 1200 as options. I would like to see that on the M2010 as well. 1680 x 1050 is not bad, but is not good enough on a 20" notebook. Also, I think it might be possible to bring down the weight to a more reasonable 10-15lbs range. At close to 20lbs for everything this will require some strength. I was joking with a friend over lunch and I think only giants will consider this a notebook PC. All others will categorize this as "luggable". You have to give some kudos to Dell for being so "out there" with the M2010.</p>
