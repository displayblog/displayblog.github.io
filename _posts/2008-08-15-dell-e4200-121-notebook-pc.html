<p><a href="http://www.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/laptop_latitude_e4200?c=us&l=en&s=biz">Dell</a> &rarr; <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/08/12/dell-announces-new-latitude-e-series/">Engadget</a>, <a href="http://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Graphics-Media-Accelerator-4500MHD-GMA-X4500MHD.9883.0.html">Notebook Check</a>: The Dell E4200 is a smallest of the E series notebook PCs. The E4200 sports a 12.1" wide TFT LCD with a LED backlight. The LED backlight allows for a thinner profile, energy savings and an increase of ruggedness over a CCFL backlight. The 12.1" wide TFT LCD features an aspect ratio of 16:10 and a pixel format of 1280x800.</p>
<p>The graphics will be powered by Intel's GMA 4500MHD GPU. Intel's 4500MHD part is a DirectX 10 capable integrated GPU and is part of the Centrino 2 platform. Like all integrated graphics solutions, the 4500MHD does not have any discrete memory and shares up to 384MB of system memory. The 4500MHD has two more shaders and a faster 533MHz clock than the X3100 chipset (500MHz). Gaming? Only if you absolutely must and have no alternatives.</p>
<p>Dell is pro-DisplayPort. That is good and all, but I feel like it is a feature that we are paying for but without much value. Aside from just a few Dell LCD monitors, I have not seen a DisplayPort-capable monitor, so if you're a DisplayPort must-have customer, then you'll need to stick to everything Dell. Maybe that's Dell's strategy. Who knows.</p>

<p>The external chassis looks very high-end and it is. The material is magnesium alloy and is used for the LCD back and the base. Magnesium alloy is tough and durable and is the reason why a lot of notebook PC manufacturers are using this material.</p>
<p>Speaking of tough, the E4200 comes with either 64GB or 128GB SSDs. No spinning drives here, not even as an option. The 64GB is of the UltraPerformance variety while the 128GB SSD seems to be just an ordinary one. Of course there is nothing ordinary about SSD as you get a speed bump, especially for reading random data, a reduction of power and a step up in ruggedness over spinning HDDs. All in all, at just 2.2lbs, Dell's new E4200 looks to become a favorite for globetrotters that require less weight, durability, and full functionality.</p>
