<p>If you look at the picture closely you can see the elliptical-shaped display. I am not sure if this is a projected display or a regular LCD but it looks pretty cool. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/10/28/lg-display-lpl-next-generation-display-technology-at-fpd-international-2008/">Non-rectangular LCDs are nothing new</a> but this would be a first automotive implementation as far as I know. Not only is the Tramontana R a automotive tour de force but it's got a high-tech LCD instrument cluster to boot.</p>
