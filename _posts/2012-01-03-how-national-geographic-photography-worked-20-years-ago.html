<blockquote><p>And changes. Man, is that an understatement. High res digital cameras have replaced film cameras. Hard drives store pictures, not little yellow boxes. Kodak&acirc;&euro;&trade;s stopped making carousel projectors. Photographers go to the magazine far less often, given digital transmission. Ties and jackets are seen less frequently.</p>
<p>But, the main mission, over time, has remained. Tell a good story in pictures. The major components--photographer, picture editor, designer, magazine editor--are all still in place, and the interplay among them is ongoing and largely unchanged.</blockquote></p>
<p>It used to take almost an entire year to bring together a 40 page story with 40 photos. Check out the <a href="http://www.joemcnally.com/blog/2012/01/02/starting-off-looking-back/">video at Joe McNally's blog</a>.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203471004577140841495542810.html">The Wall Street Journal</a> reports Eastman Kodak is on the brink of bankruptcy. It doesn't seem that long ago Kodak was synonymous with photography. After graduating from high school I did Lotus 1-2-3 work and with that money bought myself a Canon Rebel SLR. I fondly remember taking photos in black and white as a photographer for my local church. The memory itself is in black and white, making it all the more nostalgic. I also remember the film; it almost always came in a yellow box with Kodak printed on it.</p>
