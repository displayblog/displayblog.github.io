<p><a href="http://www.shopping.hp.com/webapp/shopping/series_can.do?storeName=computer_store&amp;landing=notebooks&amp;a1=Category&amp;v1=ENVY&amp;jumpid=in_R329_prodexp/hhoslp/psg/lateralnav_envy_notebooks">HP</a> via <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/07/hp-updates-envy-13-and-envy-15-laptops-lowers-prices-significan/">Engadget</a>: The major updates to HP's Envy 13 and Envy 15 are the new prices. The Envy 15 starts at US$1299.99, $400 cheaper, and includes: 2.4GHz Core i5-520M CPU, 4GB DDR3 RAM, ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5830 with a huge 1GB of VRAM, and Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit. The Envy 13 starts at $1499.99, $300 cheaper, and includes: 1.6GHz Core 2 Duo SL9300, ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4330 with 512MB VRAM and a 4-cell battery.</p>
<p>Since HP's Envy notebooks look strikingly similar to Apple's MacBook Pro notebooks, I believe a quick comparison is warranted. The 13-inch MacBook Pro starts at just $1199 but lacks a discrete GPU but a much faster 2.26GHz Core 2 Duo CPU and lasts for a rated 7 hours. If a powerful CPU is in need the MacBook Pro is the better choice. On the other hand, if graphics is more important the Envy 13 should have significantly better performance.</p>
<p>The Envy 15 with its $1299.99 starting price is actually quite a bit more competitive to the 15-inch MacBook Pro, which lags in CPU power with a 2.53GHz Core 2 Duo (the Core i5 on the Envy 15 should spank it easily). The 15-inch MacBook Pro also lacks a discrete GPU but is $400 more expensive starting at $1699.00. With a similar look but much more powerful hardware the Envy 15 beats the MacBook Pro in price by a very wide margin. This was just a quick comparison and I realize it is an 'apples'-to-oranges comparison but with the lower prices HP has made its Envy line significantly more competitive, especially the Envy 15. </p>
