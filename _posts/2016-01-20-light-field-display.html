<blockquote><p>Whilst capturing light field data is an amazing step forward in technology, the next link in the chain is light field display. A light field display releases the same data set that a light field camera captures. That is, rather than just pixels that glow different colors and intensities making a flat image, a light field display reproduces the direction of the photons being released. This adds amazing new qualities to the image and is a paradigm shift in the way we view screens.</blockquote><br />
The only catalyst powerful enough to get light field camera technology into the mainstream is the smartphone. And not just any smartphone from some no-name brand, but smartphones from major brands like Apple or Samsung.</p>
<p>If in the future Apple decides to put light field camera technology into an iPhone or if Samsung did the same with&nbsp;one of its Galaxy smartphones then light field camera technology will definitely go mainstream. But that also means Apple or Samsung will have made the smartphone with a light field display. What's the use of capturing light field images if you can't fully see them?</p>
<p>Capturing light field images and being able to display them sounds really cool. But it might take a while.</p>
