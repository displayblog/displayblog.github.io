<blockquote>
<p>The 4.2-inch screen remains a formidable performer. Despite its LCD roots, Sony's Mobile Bravia Engine seems to perform minor miracles on the 854 x 480 display, with sharp detail and rich coloration. While its effects are limited to pictures and video, menus and icons still look rich, and blacks look black. With over four inches of space for your fingers, that's plenty of real estate to browse the web, play games and type on the stock keyboard. Sadly, tilting the screen shows up its limitations -- this isn't an IPS panel, and whilst we understand it's doing its best, nor can it stand up to the might of Super AMOLED plus.</p><br />

<p>I think we're at a point where if you're a smartphone brand and want to compete for premium customers there are only two choices when it comes to displays: IPS LCD or the higher end varieties of OLED displays manufactured by Samsung.</p></p>
