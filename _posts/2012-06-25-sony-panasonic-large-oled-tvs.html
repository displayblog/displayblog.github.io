<blockquote><p>Sony and Panasonic plan to jointly develop next-generation OLED panels and modules by each utilizing their core and printing technologies. They plan to jointly develop printing method-based next-generation OLED technology, which will be suitable for low-cost mass production of large, high resolution OLED panels and modules.

<p>Better late than never. Looking forward to 55-inch OLED TVs <em>this</em> year by LG and Samsung.</p>
