<a href="http://www.lgdisplay.com/lgdhp/app/pr/newsView.dev?seq=3319">LG Display</a> is showcasing its 84-inch 3DTV with a pixel format of 3840x2160 also called UHD for Ultra High Definition at SID 2010. UHD has four times the number of pixels compared to 1920x1080 and the additional pixels are quite necessary. When going from 2D to 3D you effectively lose about half of the display's resolution capability. So 3D on an UHD display will get you more detail resolution than 2D on 1920x1080. I wonder when we'll get to see something like this at stores at decent prices.</p>
