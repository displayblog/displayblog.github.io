<p><a href="http://www.cio.com/blog_view.html?CID=21956">CIO</a>: The company claims its 7.1&#39; e-paper with 1536x2048 pixels is the world&#39;s highest resolution and approximates an A6-sized paper (105mm x 14mm). Flexible memory chips are used and is incorporated into the plastic substrate, enabling the screen to bend. The screen has E-Ink technology.</p>
<p>The only value-add that flexibility adds to displays is the enhanced durability. That&#39;s it. In most cases, from what I know, people prefer flat screens to curved screens. Didn&#39;t we already go through this phase with TVs? Rollable displays? I don&#39;t think so. Foldable? Not even possible if you want a seamless display. The 1536x2048 pixel format is very nice and should bring about some very crisp text.</p>
