<p><a href="http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2012/8/comScore_Reports_June_2012_U.S._Mobile_Subscriber_Market_Share">comScore</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Google: 51.0% &rarr; 51.6%, +0.6</li>
<li>Apple: 30.7% &rarr; 32.4%, +1.7</li>
<li>RIM: 12.3% &rarr; 10.7%, -1.6</li>
<li>Microsoft: 3.9% &rarr; 3.8%, -0.1</li>
<li>Symbian: 1.4% &rarr; 0.9%, -0.5</li><br />
</ol></p>
<p>Apple outpaced Google in comScore smartphone platform growth, for the first time in a very long time. Part of the slowdown in Google's growth seems to be lackluster performances from LG, Motorola, and Samsung.</p>
<p>More competition is better than less, but it looks like a two horse race between Apple and Google. I'd prefer a three horse race: What do you think about Microsoft buying RIM? The move would give Microsoft a smartphone platform share of almost 15%, instantly, and RIM's secure backend communications system could add to Microsoft's already strong enterprise presence.</p>
