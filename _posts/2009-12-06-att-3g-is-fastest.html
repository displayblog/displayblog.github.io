<p>AT&amp;T's <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=3g&amp;sa=Search#1348">3G</a> data network is the fastest in the US. That's true but those hyperspeed 3G data networks are limited to only a few locations unfortunately. Here's a funny ad by AT&amp;T to make sure you know it has the fastest 3G. I understand the need to 'inform' consumers about your products and services through ads, but in this case it might have been money better spent putting up another cell tower in, say, the SF Bay Area. Of course we wouldn't have this issue <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/11/30/qualcomm-in-talks-with-apple/">if Apple would just kick out an iPhone that works on both GSM and CDMA networks</a>.
