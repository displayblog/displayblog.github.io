<p><strong>Opening Doors</strong> Hsien-lin Huang, an official at Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs, shared that the island is considering allowing Chinese investors to purchase stakes in the country's LCD and semiconductor companies. Taiwan is also considering to allow local LCD and semiconductor companies to set up plants in China and purchase stakes in mainland Chinese businesses.</p>
<p><strong>Bright Future</strong> With a domestic market composed of 1.2 billion in population combined with rapid economic growth, the future of China is golden. Transportation costs and the time it takes to send large LCD panels to be modularized and integrated into LCD goods can be significantly reduced by building a LCD fab close to where demand is.</p>
