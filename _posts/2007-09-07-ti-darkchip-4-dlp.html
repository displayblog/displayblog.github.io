<p class="P1">TI's DarkChip 4 is DLP chip that the company claims has a native contrast ratio of 15,000:1 that is 30% better than the previous generation chips. The DarkChip 4 will be incorporated into DLP products in 2008. In addition, TI states that colors are in the trillions. Combined with LED illumination, a DLP TV set with DarkChip 4 has a native contrast ratio of 100,000:1.</p></p>
<p class="P1">These contrast ratios are out of this world! I am not a big fan of DLP (I lean toward LCoS) but there seems to be continued improvements coming out of TI. As DLP and LCoS-based rear-projection TV sets become slimmer and as consumers want larger and larger TVs, there will soon be an inflection point that we will get to where rear-projection TVs become significantly more popular. For instance, starting from 70" and larger HDTVs,&Acirc;&nbsp; there is no other technology besides DLP and LCoS that provides a reasonable price.</p></p>
