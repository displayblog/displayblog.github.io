<p><strong>Business</strong> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=plastic+logic&amp;sa=Search#1363"> Plastic Logic</a> announced on October 19, 2009 that it will unveil its QUE proReader designed for business professionals on January 7, 2010 at the Central Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center Booth #11840 during the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Plastic Logic is expanding the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=ebook+reader&amp;sa=Search#1348">ebook reader</a> category by targeting business professionals and connecting them via 3G (AT&amp;T) and WiFi to business and professional newspapers, books, magazines, etc. The QUE supports business document formats such as PDF, Word, PowerPoint and Excel.</p>
<p><strong>Rugged</strong> The QUE has an 8.5 x 11-inch dimension, the same as a letter-sized piece of paper. The proReader is extremely thin at just 1/3-inch. Plastic Logic touts the QUE as featuring the largest touchscreen in the ebook reader market.

<p><strong>Amazon Has Competition</strong> Plastic Logic claims that its QUE store will offer the largest collection of business-related reading materials. The store will be powered by Barnes &amp; Noble.</p>
