<blockquote><p>The screen is bright, and it has an anti-glare coating that makes it pop outdoors. But I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m a little disappointed the screen is not sharper. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s tough to see any rough edges when watching videos or when sweeping through the main UI, but when reading web pages or when looking at photos with subtle gradients, the lack of precision is a drag. I held it up against the iPhone 4&acirc;&euro;&trade;s display and saw a noticable difference.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Motorola Droid Bionic sports a 4.3-inch 960x540 LCD with a PenTile Matrix 2x2 sub-pixel structure. Photos and videos look very good on a PenTile Matrix display, but where it falls short is text. The iPhone 4 has a RGB-stripe 960x640 LCD.</p>

<blockquote><p>The 4.3-inch qHD (Quarter High Definition) display isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t as sharp as we expect a 960-by-540-pixel screen to be. The images I loaded from my Facebook profile looked a little grainy, with a slight bluish tint. I could also see a grid of dots in the image--even without zooming in. Unfortunately, this isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t the first time we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve taken issue with a Motorola phone&acirc;&euro;&trade;s display. The Photon also had a slight bluish tint, and the Droid 3&acirc;&euro;&trade;s qHD display suffered from the dots issue. I was impressed, however, with how sharp the text looked in the browser and in Gmail.</blockquote></p>
<p>I expected issues with text.</p>
<p><a href="http://thisismynext.com/2011/09/07/motorola-droid-bionic-review/">Joshua Topolsky</a>, This is my next:</p>
<blockquote><p>The display resolution is not dissimilar from other Motorola devices I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve seen recently, though I felt the color balance and sharpness was notably improved on this handset.</blockquote></p>
<p>That's all Topolsky has to say about the display. Usually he does a much thorough job. Not dissimilar? The 960x540 RGBW PenTile Matrix LCD is the <em>same</em> as other Motorola smartphones that sport the 'qHD' pixel format. With that said, how does one go about improving sharpness on the same display?</p>

<blockquote><p>The BIONIC sports a 4.3-inch, qHD (540 x 960 pixel) display. It uses the same pentile layout as we saw on the DROID X2, DROID 3, and PHOTON 4G from Motorola. Screens with pentile layouts have more noticeable pixels than traditional layouts, which can cause the screen to look less sharp when viewed up close. The BIONIC doesn't have too much of an issue with this problem, though nobody will mistake its screen for the Retina Display of an iPhone 4.</blockquote></p>
<p>On a smartphone or a tablet the quality of the display is most important. Everything is presented on the display: the user interface, videos, images, text, etc. From what I've read so far regarding the Motorola Droid Bionic, the 4.3-inch 960x540 RGBW PenTile Matrix doesn't come close to toppling the king of the hill: the 3.5-inch 960x640 RGB-stripe IPS LCD on the iPhone 4.</p>
