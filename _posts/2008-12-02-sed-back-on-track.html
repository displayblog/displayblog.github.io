<p>Fast forward to July 2008. An appeals court reversed the May 2007 ruling on a technicality and Applied Nanotech has just decided that it will not appeal to the US Supreme Court. Douglas Baker, Applied Nanotech's CFO stated, "It would probably be a futile effort." Now Canon has the green light to continue its R&amp;D and commercialize SED technology. Canon is working on a new production process that brings the cost of manufacturing of SEDs competitive with LCDs according to Tsuneji Uchida, Canon's President.</p>
<p>Don't hold your breath. "At times like this, new display products are not introduced much because people would laugh at them," said Uchida. That would imply that Canon will not be bringing <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sed-tv">SED TV</a>s anytime soon. However, CES 2009 is just around the corner and people expect new display products at the show and would cheer (not laugh) at a SED TV prototype by Canon.</p>
<p>Take a look at the video (it takes a bit to get going):</p>
