<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/01/08/acer-aspire-a5-ultrabook-announced-ces-2012/">Engadget</a>. <a href="http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/press/2012/28709">Acer</a>: The claim to fame for the 13.3-inch Acer Aspire S5 is its thinness at just 15mm, or 0.06 inches. Acer touts it as the world's thinnest ultrabook. To compare, the 13.3-inch MacBook Air has a thickness of 0.3cm or 0.11 inches at its thinnest part. So yes, the S5 is quite a bit thinner.</p>
<p>I like the brushed look (it's not actually brushed) of the black aluminum/magnesium chassis. The so-called isolated chiclet keyboard with its flat surrounding is nice and smooth. Unlike the <a href="/2012/01/07/vizio-ultrabook/">Vizio Ultrabook</a> that nicely aped the display hinge from Apple, the S5 ruins a sculpture-like consistency with average, and quite ugly I might add, hinges. The USB 3.0, HDMI, and Thunderbolt ports are hidden behind an I/O panel a la the original MacBook Air.</p>
<p>There is no mention of display specs, and that might be intentional. My guess is that it's a regular, meaning terrible, 13.3-inch 1366x768 TN LCD. I'll withhold final judgement until final specs and reviews are in, but I'm not holding my breath.</p>
