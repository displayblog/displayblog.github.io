<p>I got royally pissed when Apple accused people of holding the iPhone 4 the wrong way, which was causing attenuation of antenna performance leading to dropped calls. Attenuation of antenna performance. Pssh. Read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/24/apple-youre-holding-the-iphone-4-the-wrong-way/">Apple: You're Holding The iPhone 4 The Wrong Way</a></em> for more info.</p>
<p>Well, look what we have here. It seems Apple has been holding the iPhone 4 the wrong way from the very beginning:</p>
