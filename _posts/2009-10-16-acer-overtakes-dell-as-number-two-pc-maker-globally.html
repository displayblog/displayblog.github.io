<p><strong>HP Global #1</strong> According to Gartner, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=hp&amp;sa=Search">HP</a> tops the list for worldwide PC vendor, growing 9.0% Y/Y to 16.12 million units shipped in the third quarter of 2009 and grabbing a 19.9% market share.

<p><strong>Good Sign</strong> Overall PC shipments increased 0.5% Y/Y to 80.9 million units in the third quarter of 2009. In Q3'08 the number of units were 80.47 million, so we're doing slightly better this year. Sequential growth from Q2 has been stronger than historical seasonal growth at 18% Q/Q. That's a good sign. Or is it? <a id="more"></a><a id="more-7413"></a></p>
<p><strong>Growth?</strong> We all know that more and more <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=netbook&amp;sa=Search">netbooks</a> are being sold precisely because the are cheap. Since Gartner only announced the number of shipments without related revenues we don't know if this is good news or not. If consumers are still purchasing netbooks in lieu of full-blown and more expensive notebook PCs primarily because of the cheaper price, maybe things aren't that much better. And you have to consider population growth from Q3'08 to Q3'09: I'm sure the world's population grew more than 0.5% Y/Y. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_population_increase_history.svg">Wikipedia</a>, the annual growth rate was about 1.2% in 2000, and declining. Let's peg the world's population growth rate at 1.0% annually. That means the 0.5% Y/Y growth of PC unit shipments is not even growing at the rate of population growth: not good. Hopefully things will get better in the fourth quarter.</p>
