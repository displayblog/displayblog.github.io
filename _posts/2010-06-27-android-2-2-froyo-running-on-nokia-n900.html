<p>Eventually, Android 2.2 "Froyo" will be running on anything that can be hacked. Someone with mad skills loaded Android 2.2 on Nokia's hacker-friendly N900. The result is excellent browsing speeds and fairly comprehensive hardware support sans SD memory card. Check out the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U46e_VYANWs&feature=player_embedded#!">video</a> but do yourself a favor (it's quite boring) and skip to around the 4:48 mark: you'll get to see the browser flying. If Froyo runs this fast on an ARM Cortex A8 running at just 600MHz and graphics duties via PowerVR SGX530, imagine the boost in speed the 1GHz Snapdragon-based smartphones will experience.</p>
