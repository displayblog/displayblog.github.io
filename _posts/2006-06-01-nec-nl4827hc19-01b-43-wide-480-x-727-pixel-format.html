<p>NEC will launch its NL4827HC19-01B in June. The 4.3" TFT LCD panel is wide and has a pixel format of 480 x 272. A bit on the low side, but enough to be a drop-in replacement for Sony&#39;s PSP. Sony&#39;s PSP maxes out at 200 cd/m2 brightness, but this panel has 300.The target of the 4.3" display is for PDAs, photo viewers, GPS...and probably portable gaming devices. It has a touch panel too. Maybe the PSP will have touch, soon. Here are the specs:</p>
