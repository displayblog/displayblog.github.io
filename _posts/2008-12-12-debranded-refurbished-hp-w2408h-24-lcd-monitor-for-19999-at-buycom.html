<p>I have two of these that I did get from Amazon.com and they are great. They are tilted towards me so the lack of viewing angle does not bother me. The w2408h uses a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=tn">TN</a> (Twisted Nematic) TFT LCD. TN LCDs have really fast response times, slightly narrower viewing angles, and much cheaper prices. If you require high color fidelity at different angles from your monitor, this is not the one to get. Instead, look for LCD monitors that use either <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=pva">PVA</a> (Patterned Vertical Alignment, mostly made by <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=samsung">Samsung</a>) or <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=ips">IPS</a> (In-Plane Switching, mostly made by <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lg-display">LG Display</a>) LCD panels. The colors are really nice on this monitor. The response times are very fast. Although I'm not a gamer, the ocassional games that I do play (Counterstrike, Starcraft: I'm old school) looks great. Although the 2408h pivots into portrait mode, I would not recommend doing that with this monitor. Because of the limited viewing angles, color looks odd when in portrait mode. It might be just me but I would recommend testing it out before buying.</p>
