<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/12/13/3761898/samsung-young-sohn-apple-ecosystem-silicon-valley-startup">The Verge</a>. Samsung chief strategy officer Young Sohn, in an interview with Jessica Leber, <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/508306/the-man-looking-to-turn-samsung-into-a-silicon-valley-trendsetter/">MIT Technology Review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Look at your phone [pointing to my Samsung Galaxy Nexus]. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a better phone, in my view. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a better display. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s faster. But eventually the connected ecosystem is really critical.</blockquote></p>
<p>Sohn uses a Mac, an iPhone, and an iPad at home. He doesn't say which iPhone but let's assume he's got the latest and greatest: the iPhone 5.</p>
<p>If he truly believes a 4.65-inch HD Super AMOLED with a PenTile Matrix 1280x720 logical pixel format is a better display than the 4-inch 326-ppi 1136x640 IPS LCD with RGB subpixels used in the iPhone 5, I am afraid Samsung's technology strategy is already flawed. One big reason is resolution: <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/12/04/galaxy-nexus-316-hole-mask/">The HD Super AMOLED doesn't come close to 326 ppi</a>.</p>
