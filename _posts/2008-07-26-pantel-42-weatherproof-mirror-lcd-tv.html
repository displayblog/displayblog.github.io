There are mirror LCD TVs already on the market. For instance, Philips offers its own Mirror TV called Miravision and you can order it today for a really expensive price of just <a href="http://www.waterprooftv.co.uk/philips_32landscape.htm">&Acirc;&pound;2999.99</a> for a 32" model. Why would you order one of these?</p>
<p>You can put a Mirror TV in your bathroom, shower, sauna or anywhere you would like to replace your mirror, or just simply anywhere. Pantel received a lot of credit for its outdoor weatherproof TV line and now the company is going one step further and bringing that technology in addition to mirror technology inside the home. Instead of simply taking a shower, you can catch up on your email or enjoy the morning news. Now, thanks to technology the boss can interrupt you even while you're in the bathroom without your <a href="http://http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=">BlackBerry</a>.</p>
