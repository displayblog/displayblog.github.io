<p><a href="http://www.compoundsemi.com/documents/articles/news/9925.html">Compound Semiconductors Online</a>: On March 26, 2008, the U.S. Department of Energy&acirc;&euro;&trade;s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) announced the achievement of 19.9% efficiency with a copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) thin-film solar cell. The record efficiency for a multicrystaline silicon solar cell is 20.3%. Thin-film solar cells require less energy to manufacture and can be placed on glass, metal foils, high temperature polymers (such as plastics), or stainless steel sheets.</p>
<p>This certainly is an important step for thin-film solar and helps in challenging the notion that thin-film PVs have less efficiency than polysilicon-based PVs, but there is a very long and challenging road ahead for thin-film PVs with close to 20% efficiencies to be volume manufactured and applied to real-world applications. Let's hope the wait is not too long.</p>
