Palm's Pre will be luanching on Saturday, June 6, 2009, just a couple of days before Apple's WWDC kicks off. Many are expecting Apple to announce an updated <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250:8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID:11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=iphone&amp;sa=Search">iPhone</a>. <a id="more"></a><a id="more-6203"></a></p>
<p><strong>Korea &amp; Japan</strong> Will Palm's Pre dent the success of the iPhone? Probably. Palm's Pre makes use of the CDMA network for voice communications, which is what Sprint and Verizon Wireless uses. But so does South Korea and Japan--the two craziest countries where people upgrade really expensive phones almost every year! The iPhone hasn't seen much success in Japan because it is simply too simple and easy to use. In South Korea? Well, nobody really knows because there hasn't been an official launch there. I think Palm's Pre will get to South Korea before the iPhone. And when that happens, Apple's iPhone will have a tough time there.</p>
