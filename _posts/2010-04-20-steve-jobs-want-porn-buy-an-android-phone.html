<p>Steve Jobs <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/04/steve-jobs-porn/">Wired</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[...] we do believe we have a moral responsibility to keep porn off the iPhone. Folks who want porn can buy an Android phone. [...] You know, there's a porn store for Android. You can download nothing but porn, your kids can download porn. That's a place we don't want to go, so we're not going to go there.</blockquote><br />
I don't want my kids to go there either. If I had to choose between an Android phone and the iPhone for my kids the decision is simple: I would choose the iPhone.</p>
