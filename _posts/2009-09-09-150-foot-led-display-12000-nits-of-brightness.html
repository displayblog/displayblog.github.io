<p><strong>Largest West of Vegas</strong> Patrick Boyd of Electronic Communication Displays believes this 150-foot LED display is the largest west of Las Vegas. There are seven other outdoor displays that the company has installed on the Emerald Queen Casino property. Three additional outdoor LCDs are planned. The outdoor displays are all remotely managed by three Windows XP Embedded controllers.

<p>PS: I just want to make a quick comment about gambling. I personally gamble but I don't want it to seem like I am endorsing it by posting this... umm... post. I personally set aside a small amount of money: if I lose it in in one hour (much sooner most of the time), then that's it--no more gambling. If I win a good chunk of money (almost never happens) I also stop gambling and start shopping and eating. Here's a good site to gamble responsibly: <a href="http://www.salvationarmy.org.au/SALV/LANDING/PC_61823.html">Responsible Gambling Tips</a> by The Salvation Army.</p>
