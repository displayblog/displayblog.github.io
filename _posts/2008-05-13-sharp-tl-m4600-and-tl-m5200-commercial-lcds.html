<p>Sharp's TL-M4600 and TL-M5200 commercial LCDs sport fan-less cooling systems, a LAN port and a built-in web browser. Sharp has made a very interesting decision to include a built-in web browser. In effect, what Sharp did was to include PC capability. (Say what?) With cloud computing becoming the next wave of how computing will change, the web browser will become the essential conduit to which you interact with the cloud. I didn't see touch capability as one of its features. That is unfortunate as touch plus a web browser could have been a powerful combination for commercial applications.
