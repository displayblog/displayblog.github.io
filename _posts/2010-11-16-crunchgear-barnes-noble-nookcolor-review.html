<blockquote><p>Unlike e-ink screens, text is deep black on bright white, which improves the reading experience. However, we must remember that the NookColor is still back-lit and as such it could affect your sleep simply because staring at a bright screen before bed isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t the best way to unwind. The trade-off, then is clear &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; absolutely clarity vs. eye-soothing e-ink.</blockquote></p>
<p>The NookColor uses a transmissive TFT LCD that shoots light from the backlight and then bounced toward the front of the screen. The edge-lit backlight is most likely located on the bottom of the display.</p>
<p>If you really want to sleep turn off everything and just go to sleep. I think that's the best way. One question: how do you read something off of an E Ink-based ereader without some kind of light?</p>
<blockquote><p>The second problem is the NookColor&acirc;&euro;&trade;s biggest issue: it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s no good in direct sunlight. While the screen is surprisingly bright and clear, I took this outside hoping I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d be able to read the screen under an overcast sky. Nope. It was as washed out as the iPad in direct sun.</blockquote></p>
<p>I usually read inside. Since the weather is getting colder I don't think this will be much of a problem for the next several months. But when the days get warmer and you want to read your ebooks outside in the warm sun the NookColor will not be of any help. I prefer real books anyway.</p>
