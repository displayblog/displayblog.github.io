<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=pioneer">Pioneer</a>'s <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=kuro">KURO</a> technology is known for its deep black levels. The company stopped putting contrast ratio figures because it was getting ridiculous. With black levels that are almost completely black the contrast ratio comes close being infinity:1. The PDP-5020FD is a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=50"">50"</a> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=plasma-tv">plasma TV</a> with a pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a>. There are plenty of connectivity options as well as a built-in ATSC tuner (for those who would rather not spend money when there are free HDTV signals all around). Normally, you would need to spend a considerabl sum (around $4000) but at Sixth Avenue Electronics, you can use the code <strong>AFLPIO2248</strong> for a discount of $1751 in addition to the $1 off (yes, the store is being very generous!). Shipping is free. If you've been eyeing the KUROs and just could not justify the extremely high price tag (even if many tout it as one of the best in the world), this is a chance to grab a 50" KURO for consirably less than MSRP.</p>
