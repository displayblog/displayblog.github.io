<p>Sony's SRX-R220 is a front projector that has a brightness of 18,000 lumens and a resolution of 4096 x 2160. The ultra-bright unit uses a 4Kw lamp and is one of the brightest front projectors around and that brightness is more or less required for its intended purpose: digital theaters. It is based on Sony's LCoS implementation, the SXRD chip. Price? Better just pony up $10 at the theater to watch the SRX-R220 in action.</p>
