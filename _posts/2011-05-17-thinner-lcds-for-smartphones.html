<blockquote><p>Next year, the average thickness of LCD panels used in smart phones and tablet PCs is going to be reduced down to 0.3mm. At present, the figure stands at approximately 0.5mm. </p>
<p>If the slimmer glass substrate is applied to the Galaxy S2, the newest flagship smart phone of Samsung Electronics, the product thickness can decrease by 0.4mm to 8.5mm.</blockquote></p>
<p>Thinner and lighter smartphones. Sounds good to me.</p>
