<p>As of May 9, 2008, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=motorola">Motorola</a>'s Q9c <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=smartphone">smartphone</a> is available on Verizon Wireless. The Q9c is physically identical to the Q9m but is more focused on the enterprise (following the footsteps of the iPhone and getting enterprise friendly?). So Motorola has the Q9m and now the Q9c. What's next? Another version of the Q? Just like it did with the RAZR? I think Motorola should stop trying to milk as much out of the Q and start furiously building the next thing, if they haven't already. And where's <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=touch">touch</a> capability?</p>
<p>I was just reading the latest issue of BusinessWeek (May 19, 2008) and wanted to share some tidbits from the article titled "LG CLOSES IN ON MOTOROLA". Strategy Analytics is thinking that if Motorola doesn't get its act together (I don't think it will) then <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lg">LG</a> will probably overtake Motorola for the #3 spot later in 2008. In Q1'08, LG's market share was 8.6% a sizable increase from 6.4% in Q1'07. With 8.6% shipment market share LG took the #4 spot ahead of Sony Ericsson.</p>
<p>The article also states that "Motorola relied too heavily on its trend-setting, ultra-slim RAZR." I can't agree more. And history is repeating itself in Motorola's smartphone offering. There will most likely be different colors, shapes, sizes, backgrounds, button shapes, whatever of the Q in the coming months. LG is doing something completely different: Skott Ahn, who is the top dog at LG's handset unit, has doubled the number of designers to 150 and engineers to 4000 and has urged everyone to develop distinctive new models. One such model, LG's Secret has been hot. LG's handset unit profits are expected to hit $2 billion while sales increase 50% Y/Y in 2008. With all that success coming, look at what Ahn has to say: "We have a long way to go, but we are on the right track." Wow. Now that's something: no resting on laurels.</p>
