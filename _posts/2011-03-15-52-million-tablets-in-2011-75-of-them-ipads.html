<p><a http://www.cultofmac.com/analyst-52m-tablets-in-2011-75-percent-apples/86460">Cult of Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Canalys expects to see 52 million of the devices shipped this year &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; and Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s iPad will account for 75 percent of the sales.</blockquote></p>
<p>That makes it 39 million iPads in 2011. Revenues from iPads would be a staggering US$19 <em>billion</em>, at the least.</p>
