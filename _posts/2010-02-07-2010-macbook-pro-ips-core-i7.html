<p><a href="http://browse.geekbench.ca/geekbench2/view/210968">Geekbench</a> (<em>via</em> <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2010/02/06/unreleased-core-i7-macbook-pro-61-benchmarked-supplies-constrained/">MacRumors</a>)&Acirc;&nbsp;reported benchmark performance numbers for what seems to be an unreleased MacBook Pro running a 2.66GHz Core i7-620M (dual-core) CPU, which sport Turbo Boost and Hyperthreading. The final Geekbench score of 5260 is quite a bit higher than a current MacBook Pro running at 2.66GHz with scores in the range of 3700 - 4000. It is about time Apple updated its unibody MacBook Pros. A quad-core MacBook Pro is probably not in the works as it poses two challenges: heat &amp; battery. It has been reported that HP's Envy 15 sporting a quad-core i7 CPU generates enough heat to make the underbelly uncomfortably hot. Battery life is dismal too. Although I believe Apple has superior ability to develop hardware with better thermal &amp; battery management, I don't think the end result will meet the company's minimum specifications for its MacBook Pro line.</p>
<p>More importantly I would like to see Apple continue its focus on using high-end display panels. I believe the 9.7-inch IPS LCD is the smallest in quite some time and so size is not a limitation. With the development of e-IPS (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/01/28/lg-display-lpl-23-e-ips-1080p-lcd-monitor-panel/">LG Display 23-inch e-IPS 1080p LCD Monitor Panel</a></em> and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/02/13/lg-display-e-ips-lcd-panel-update-2/"><em>LG Display e-IPS LCD Panel Update</em></a>), LG Display was able to reduce the design complexity, lower component costs (especially of the backlight unit) and lower power consumption. Best of all prices are not much more than run-of-the-mill TN displays. By combining exceptional viewing angles, lower power consumption with the benefit significantly outweighing the additional cost, I expect the entire MacBook Pro line to transition toward IPS LCDs.</p>
