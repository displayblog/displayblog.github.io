<p>There are two displays on the W710. The main display has a 176*220 pixel format that has 262,000 colors. The sub-display is a 1.5" CSTN 128*128 pixel format 4-level orange on black LCD, and it looks really cool. Just to give you a couple unique features of this phone:</p>
<p>-Jogging application: Measure speed and distance.<br />
-Step counter: A counter that measures steps taken.</p>
<p>The W710i is for Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Americas while the W710c is for mainland China. Both units are EDGE class 10 and GPRS class 10 capable quad-band (850, 900, 1800, 1900) GSM phones.
