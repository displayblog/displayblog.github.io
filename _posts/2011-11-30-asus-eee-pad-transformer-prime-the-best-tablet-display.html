<blockquote>The resolution is a Honeycomb-standard 1280 x 752. The 16:9 panel measures 10.1-inches diagonally, giving it a larger surface area than the iPad 2's 9.7-inch 4:3 display. The increase in resolution more than makes up for the larger screen however, ASUS delivers 145 pixels per inch compared to the iPad 2's now quite-dated ~132 PPI.</blockquote>
<p>I wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t aware that 1280x752 was standard for anything. And to get an aspect ratio of 16:9 with RGB square pixels you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re looking at a pixel format of 1280x720, not 1280x752. I think Shimpi might have been too eager to exaggerate a minute difference: The 13 ppi advantage in resolution will likely be felt by a very few.</p><br />
<blockquote>It's not all about pixel density here, the Transformer Prime has better white and black levels than anything else in its class. It also sets the new benchmark for contrast ratio at nearly 1200:1. The huge gap between the outermost glass and the IPS LCD panel has been reduced significantly, in turn reducing glare.</blockquote>
<p>Not <em>quite</em> true. ASUS has an interesting mode called Super IPS+. In SIPS+ mode the Eee Pad Transformer Prime boasts the highest brightness (white) of 683 nits from the stock 436, but also has the disadvantage of boosting black levels from a class-leading 0.37 nits to a 0.59-nit laggard, behind every other tablet except for the BlackBerry PlayBook. The Eee Pad Transformer Prime is brightest in SIPS+ mode and has the deepest blacks in regular mode.</p>
<p>The air gap between the LCD and the cover glass lends to trapped dust and light refraction. Both can be completely eliminated by optically laminating the two. Glare is a different issue and can only be fixed when cover glass manufacturers like Corning, Asahi, Schott, etc. develop matte versions.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/12/01/asus-eee-pad-transformer-prime-review/">Engadget</a>:</p><br />
<blockquote>
<p>The luminosity is quite noticeable, and the contrast too, with deep darks and vibrant brights. However, color reproduction seemed a bit flat, with whites tending toward yellow and brighter hues coming up short.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><em>Update 2:</em> <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/5175/asus-transformer-prime-followup">Anand Lai Shimpi</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Glare is still a big issue if you're in a sunny environment; however, I was surprised to see that even without engaging the Prime's Super IPS+ mode that the display was usable in many cases outdoors. I definitely preferred the experience with Super IPS+ mode enabled though. While the glossy screen picks up fingerprints and is extremely reflective, the 600+ nits the panel is able to put out in its brightest mode definitely overcome both of these concerns.</blockquote></p>
<p>Why must we deal with glare.</p>
