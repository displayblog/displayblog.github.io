<blockquote><p>As a software developer who spends his time in front of some screen or other for the majority of his waking hours, I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t want to be constantly prodded by some little jumped-up sundial when I clock off. I want out. No form factor, no matter how sleek and aluminium-y, is going to change that. My old watch, a &Acirc;&pound;10 digital from Argos, told the time, and voiced an alarm when I told it to. That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s it. [...] The whole point of a smartwatch is that you wear it. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s there all the time. And that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s horrible.</blockquote></p>
<p>Me? I don't wear a watch. I don't need to know the exact minute of every moment of my life, but on the occasion I do &mdash; when I deliver lunch for my kids for instance &mdash; I have a phone. How funny: I probably use my phone more as a clock than a phone.</p>
<p>We need to be punctual, yes, but we don't need to hurry. I give myself a decently large buffer between things I need to do. With the lunch delivery example, if I need to prepare, pack, and deliver lunch for my kids by 11:40 am on Fridays and it takes about 30 minutes to do that, I'll give myself 10 extra minutes. I check the clock to see if it's getting close to 11, and one more time around 11:30. That's it. Less stress, and I enjoy it more. No need for a watch let alone a constantly nagging smartwatch on my wrist. My phone nags me well enough.</p>
<p>Sometimes I stare at my smartphone and wonder what it would be like to live without it.</p>
