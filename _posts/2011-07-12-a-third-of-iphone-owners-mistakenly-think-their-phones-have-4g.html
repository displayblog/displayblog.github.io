<p>Andrew at <a href="http://www.retrevo.com/content/blog/2011/07/confusion-and-skepticism-may-impede-4g-adoption">Retrovo Blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Maybe the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;4&acirc;&euro;¬ù in the iPhone 4 name gives iPhone owners (34%) the false impression that they already own a 4G phone but the fact is Apple doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t offer a 4G phone at the moment.</blockquote></p>
<p>Some call an iPhone 4 an iPhone 4G. 24% of BlackBerry owners were also confused. Thanks to AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint, and others the term 4G means jack. The only thing it means, most of the time: 4G is faster than 3G.</p>
<p>Maybe Apple should go back to calling iPhone simply iPhone, without the suffix nonsense.</p>
