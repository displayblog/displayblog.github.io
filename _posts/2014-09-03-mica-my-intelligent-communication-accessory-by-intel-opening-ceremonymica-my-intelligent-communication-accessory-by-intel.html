<p>Lisa Eadicicco, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/intel-and-opening-ceremonys-mica-smart-bracelet-coming-to-barneys-2014-9">Business Insider</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The MICA comes with its own 3G radio, which means it won't have to be tethered to a smartphone to pull up emails, text messages, and posts from your social media feed.</p>
<p>This information is displayed on a 1.6-inch curved touchscreen coated with scratch-resistant sapphire, which faces the inside of your wrist rather than the outside like most smartwatches. This is meant to keep your information private, according to Intel.</blockquote></p>
<p>Intel's New Devices Group partnered with Opening Ceremony to create MICA. The high tech bracelet was designed as an accessory first and gadget second; it sure looks the part. Estimated price will be about US$1,000 at Barneys and <a href="http://www.openingceremony.us">Opening Ceremony</a> stores. Pricey.</p>
