Apple also denies patent infringement and even if the company were to have infringed them the patents are invalid and unenforceable. Another claim by Apple is Nokia's terms for licensing the patents included a cross-license for Apple's various <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=iphone&amp;sa=Search#1348">iPhone</a> patents. If what Apple is saying is true then Nokia was stupid to demand a cross-license and shows that the market leader in terms of units is in serious trouble trying to get back into smartphone game.
