<p>The Chinese-language Commercial Times by way of DigiTimes cites data from DisplaySearch, an Austin-based market research company: 40" LCD TVs are expected to drop to $1983 in the fourth quarter of this year. That's a pretty good price! Currently, 40" LCD TVs are available from only Sony and Samsung because they share a LCD fab, S-LCD, that is optimized for 40" production. The seventh generation S-LCD fab has produced more than 330,000 units since April 2006. I'm not sure if that's a lot compared to other sizes, but it sure doesn't seem like a small number. Remember back when Gateway made a splash with 42" ED plasma TVs priced at $1999? I think we're getting close with 40" HD LCD TVs. But still, for an average Joe like me, $1999 is still expensive. I'm waiting until 40" Full HD (1080p) LCD TVs get to about $999. I'm not holding my breath. But heck, if I'm going to "invest" in a HD TV that I intend to keep for at least 5-7 years, I'm not going to get a non Full HD unit. No way. I recently recommended that my friend get a Sony 5x" SXRD unit, which is a 1080p LCoS, for about $3000.</p>
