<p><a href="http://conversations.nokia.com/2011/06/22/nokia-n9-photo-taking-and-sharing/?sf1680800=1">Nokia Conversations</a>: The Nokia N9 sports a 3.9-inch AMOLED display that looks like it will provide an exquisite visual experience. Another component that I'm very interested in is the camera. The N9 packs a Carl Zeiss Tessar lens. This isn't the first collaboration between the two companies; the N73, N8, N86, N90, N95 smartphones all had Carl Zeiss optics. Most will agree that the iPhone 4 has one of the best camera system of any smartphone so I'm not so certain to what degree a Carl Zeiss-branded lens impacts photo quality.</p>
<p>Apple has realized that a hard key provides a better actuating experience than a soft key. With iOS 5 the volume up key will act as an actuator, a feature first seen on the original Camera+ iPhone app. I'm actually quite excited. Nokia is going the other direction: the company has removed the excellent half-pressable hard key and now is going with a soft button and continuous auto focusing. I think Nokia is making a big mistake here.</p>

<p>One area where the N9 beats the iPhone 4 is image capturing speed. From turning on the camera, getting the viewfinder ready, focusing on the subject, and finally capturing the image, the N9 takes just 2.6 seconds. The iPhone 4 takes three seconds; the HTC HD7 takes 8.3 seconds. From the chart above it looks like the N9 is even faster than the Canon S95. The image capturing speed of the N9 <em>is</em> impressive but that soft-button only actuator will seem "old-school" when iOS 5 comes out.</p>
