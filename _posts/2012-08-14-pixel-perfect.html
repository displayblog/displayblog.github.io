<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/08/pixel_perfect">John Gruber</a>, from the footnotes:</p>
<blockquote><p>I gave up using a 15-inch MacBook Pro several years ago. Instead, I use one machine at my desk, connected to a standalone display, and I use an 11-inch MacBook Air when I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m away from my desk. When I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m at my desk I want a big standalone display; when I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m away from the desk I want the smallest, lightest MacBook possible. The 15-inch retina MacBook Pro doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t fit this model. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s way heavier and clumsier than the Air when used as a portable (especially on airplanes, a frequent mobile use case for me), and it would be criminal to put this machine on my desk only to hook it up to a fat-pixeled non-retina Cinema Display. There is simply no doubt in my mind that this is the best computer Apple has ever made, by a long shot, but I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t think I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m going to buy one for myself. A 13-inch MacBook Pro With Retina Display, though, might be a good tradeoff as a replacement for my current (two-year-old) Air. I just can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t see ever again buying a new non-retina Mac of any sort, the extra weight of a 13-inch MacBook Pro compared to the Air be damned.</blockquote></p>
<p>This mental differentiation between professional and consumer, is it real? Does a 13-inch MacBook Pro meet the needs of professionals while the 13-inch MacBook Air does not and more meets the needs of consumers? I have serious doubts.</p>
<p>From the very first iPad, why has there been just one singular model of the iPad? Why not a Pro version? Let me answer that: Because the need of the professional and the consumer when it comes to the iPad is the same. If they are different peripherals can make up the difference. I think this is the case for MacBooks.</p>
<p>This artificial distinction between professional and consumer for the MacBook line should be disolved. The MacBook Pro and the MacBook Air should simply be the MacBook. The MacBook should have a retina display, should be as thin as possible, should represent the best Apple can make. There should be three models: 11-inch, 13-inch, and 15-inch. And that's it.</p>
<p>There are significant benefits to unifying the notebook line into a singular MacBook line, without the Air or Pro suffixes. The biggest benefit to the folks who need to make a notebook choice is simplicity: three choices, based on display size, and to some extent price. For Apple the operational simplicity and the financial benefits gained from a simpler model lineup is significant. Profit margins on the US$499 retina iPad is unmatched in the industry, precisely because Apple buys millions of the same component. Imagine a similar situation for the MacBooks: the best, for less.</p>
