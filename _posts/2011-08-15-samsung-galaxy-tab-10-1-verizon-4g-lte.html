<p>Anand Lai Shimpi, <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/4605/samsung-galaxy-tab-101-4g-lte-review/5">AnandTech</a>:</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although Apple and competitors typically have multiple sources for display panels, Samsung is likely the sole supplier for the Super PLS screens in the Galaxy Tab 10.1. As a result there's no difference between the characteristics of the 4G Tab's display and the one we reviewed a couple of months back.</p><br />

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 (Verizon 4G LTE) is plenty bright with 498 nits, but black levels could be darker at 0.61 nits, leading to a 824:1 contrast ratio. In comparison, the iPad 2 isn't as bright (380 nits), but has lower black levels (0.44 nits), resulting in a slightly better contrast ratio (861:1).</p></p>
