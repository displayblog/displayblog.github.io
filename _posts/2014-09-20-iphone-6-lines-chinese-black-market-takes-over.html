<p>Agreeing with Stu Maschwitz, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/09/22/stu-iphone-lines">John Gruber</a> makes a good point:</p>
<blockquote><p>Count me with Stu Maschwitz: this film is pointless, and I think more than a little racist. When you can wait in line, pay $1000 for a new 6 Plus, then walk out of the store and resell it immediately for $1500 or more, that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s going to attract people who want to buy them for no reason other than to flip them. And I guarantee you not everyone waiting in line (or as they say in New York, <em>on line</em>) Friday morning to buy new iPhones just to flip them was Asian. And if the going rate in mainland China is over $2,500, <a href="http://qz.com/268219/five-million-iphone-6-handsets-are-about-to-be-smuggled-into-china/">as Quartz is reporting</a>, then [it] makes all the more sense, simply as capitalism at work, that many of the line-waiters are Chinese-Americans looking to turn a profit.</blockquote></p>
<p>The title should have been &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Chinese Gray Market Takes Over&acirc;&euro;¬ù. In <a href="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ef_BznBwktw">the video by Casey Neistat</a> there is nothing illegal going on. Shady yes, illegal no.</p>
