<p>On October 9, 2008, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lg-display">LG Display </a>(<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lpl">LPL</a>) announced a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=14.1"">14.1"</a> TFT LCD panel geared for <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=notebook-pc">notebook PC</a>s. With a single touch the viewing angles, normally 175 degrees, can be reduced to just 60. The technology is called <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=viewing-angle-image-control-display">Viewing-angle Image Control Display</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=vic">VIC</a>) technology. This becomes increasingly important as more and more take their notebook PCs and compute in public places. The best example would be on the plane: there is someone right there next to you and with very little eye movement can read what is your screen. According to LG Display there will be no adverse affect on brightness when the VIC technology is activated to reduce viewing angles. The VIC LCD panel entered mass production this month. That means that some brand out there will be coming out with a notebook PC with this LCD very soon: <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=hp">HP</a> and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dell">Dell</a> are my guesses.</p>
