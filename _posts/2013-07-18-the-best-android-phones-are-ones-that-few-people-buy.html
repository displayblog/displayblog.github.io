<p>That's <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/07/17/manjoo">John Gruber</a>&rsquo;s one-sentence summary of Farhad Manjoo's <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/07/android_vs_iphone_why_apple_still_has_the_edge_over_google_s_operating_system.single.html">article</a> about his attempt to switch to Android. Gruber's conclusion still applies, albeit a little less so, to the more popular Nexus 4, which&mdash;at a full price of only US$299 and without any of the problems Manjoo mentions&mdash;has sold well but not nearly as well as subsidized Android smartphones.</p>
