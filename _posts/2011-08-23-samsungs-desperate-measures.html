<p><a href="http://fosspatents.blogspot.com/2011/08/samsung-cites-stanley-kubricks-2001.html">Florian Mueller</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>One element of Samsung's defense strategy is interesting enough that I wanted to report on it beforehand. Ever since Apple started to assert the design of the iPad against other manufacturers, many people have been wondering whether there's actually prior art for the general design of the iPad in some futuristic devices shown in sci-fi movies and TV series. And indeed, Samsung's lawyers make this claim now in their defense against Apple's motion for a preliminary injunction.</blockquote></p>
<p>Samsung points to Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film "2001: A Space Odyssey" (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ8pQVDyaLo">YouTube clip</a>) as evidence of prior art. Desperate times call for desperate measures.</p>
