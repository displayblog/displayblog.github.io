<p><a href="http://www.akihabaranews.com/en/news_details.php?id=16981">Akihabara News</a>: The Samsung 2342BWX solves a small but painful problem. The problem has to do with 1920x1200. You see, 1920 divided by 2 equals 960. When you've opened two browser windows and click on "Show Windows Side by Side" (in Vista) the two browser windows neatly arrange themselves. But there's a problem. It's small but very annoying. Remember the 960 number? Well almost all Internet pages are formatted for 1024 pixels wide. The 960 doesn't cut it. So when I have two browser windows up on my 24-inch LCD monitor, I have to scroll horizontally for a lot of pages to see the whole page. Of course, I can zoom out but some browsers just shrink the font size and keeps the overall layout at 1024. Samsung has felt our pain and brought us the 2342BWX! More pictures after the break.</p>
<p>The 2342BWX is the first LCD monitor to sport a pixel format of 2048x1152. Now divide 2048 b two and you get 1024. Perfect. The 1152 vertical pixels are a bit less than the 1200 that I'm used to, but I'd rather have no horizontal scrolling in two browser windows rather than an extra 48 vertical pixels. But I am curious as to why Samsung decided that this monitor needed to have an aspect ratio of 16:9? Probably because it was more economical to manufacture and when you play 16:9 HD content it can scale and fit the 2342BWX perfectly without any black bars.</p>
