<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/9/2786766/samsung-smart-tv-projection-25-million-sold-2012">Adi Robertson, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The company's television head, Kim Hyun-Suk, told reporters that he projects Samsung will sell 50 million flat-screen TVs worldwide this year, of which 25 million will be "smart" models.</blockquote></p>
<p>I don't have a TV connected to any TV source, but when I used to watch TV a long time ago all I had to do was get comfortable, grab the remote, and start flipping channels. With these smart TVs watching TV will be a complex, complicated, and frustrating affair. Just the thought of having to wait for a security update is enough. I don't expect I'd like it and I bet there are many others who won't either.</p>
