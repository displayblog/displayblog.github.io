<p>Peter Kafka, <a href="http://recode.net/2014/08/27/the-netflix-case-against-comcast-in-one-chart/">Re/code</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Florance has already argued that <a href="http://recode.net/2014/02/23/netflix-and-comcast-solve-their-web-traffic-problem-with-a-long-term-deal/">Comcast forced Netflix to pay for a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;transit&acirc;&euro;¬ù deal</a>, by effectively <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2014/04/the-case-against-isp-tolls.html">degrading the quality of Netflix streams for Comcast&acirc;&euro;&trade;s broadband customers</a>. [...]</p>
<p>Now, in his FCC statement, Florance says that Netflix&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Comcast customers noticed, and complained, and in some cases quit paying for Netflix.</blockquote></p>
<p>It is 6:15pm on a Thursday evening in Silicon Valley. I am a Comcast customer and pay for 50Mbps. I wanted to see how fast my actual download speed was so went to www.speedtest.net and ran a test. The results? 5.64Mbps, a little more than 1/10th the speed I'm paying for.</p>
<p>If Comcast was messing around with Netflix streams, on top of already crappy speeds, I can understand how miserable the experience could have been. Instead of cancelling Netflix I would have cancelled Comcast. But in some areas there are no other options but Comcast.</p>
