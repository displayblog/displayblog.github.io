<p>Simon Aldous is Microsoft Partner Group Manager. In an interview with PCR (Computer &amp; IT Reseller), Aldous had this to say about <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=windows+7&amp;sa=Search#1333">Windows 7</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the things that people say an awful lot about the Apple Mac is that the OS is fantastic, that it's very graphical and easy to use. What we've tried to do with Windows 7--whether it's traditional format or in a touch format--is create a Mac look and feel in terms of graphics.</blockquote><br />
And here is Microsoft's response to what Aldous said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Simon was incorrect in describing Windows 7 in this way and subsequent headlines claiming that the Mac OS inspired Windows 7 are totally inaccurate.</blockquote><br />
What's wrong with being inspired?</p>
