  lost a LCD patent-infringement case brought upon by <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=sharp&amp;sa=Search#1348">Sharp</a>.
  The US International Trade Commission upheld a ruling by an ITC administrative judge
  on Monday stating that Samsung infringed on four of Sharp''s LCD patents. The LCD
  patents are related to improving viewing angles and response times. The ITC also
  said that Samsung must stop selling displays in the US that infringe on those patents.
  Sharp originally filed the suit against Samsung in March 2008. Samsung claimed that
  the company expects no major impact on its LCD business from the ITC''s ruling and
  is confident of its ability to meet demand for its LCD products. Samsung also noted
  that the company has no plans to negotiate with Sharp on the issue. '

<p>According to James Chung, Samsung spokesman:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are fully committed to honor our responsibility to our business partners and are taking appropriate actions to meet the market demand for Samsung LCD panels and products without any interruption.</blockquote><br />
<strong>Presidential Review</strong> Samsung is required to post a bond worth 100% of the affected products pending a review of the ITC ruling by President Barack Obama. Obama can overturn the ban if he finds the ruling contrary to the public's interest. The presidential review period can take up to 60 days. The ITC case number is 337-TA-631. The import ban should not have any impact on the LCD goods that have already been imported into the US. Also because of the duration of the presidential review Samsung's holiday season sales should have little to no impact.</p>
