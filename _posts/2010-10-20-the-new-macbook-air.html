<p>Apple is billing the new MacBook Air, "The next generation of MacBooks." There are two sizes: 13.3 and 11.6.</p>
<p>The 13.3-inch MacBook Air packs in 1440x900 pixels and weighs 2.9 pounds. The smaller 11.6-inch MacBook Air sports 1366x768 pixels and is lighter at just 2.3 pounds. I didn't hear anything about IPS unfortunately.</p>
<p>It is interesting that the 13.3-inch MacBook Air has more pixels than the 13.3-inch MacBook Pro (1280x800) and is equivalent to what we see on the 15.4-inch version. The 13.3-inch MacBook Air's pixel density, or resolution, is 127.68 PPI, which is only second to the 133.19 PPI we see on the 17-inch MacBook Pro with its 1920x1200 pixel format. I imagine the current line of MacBook Pro's will soon be updated: 1440x900 (13.3), 1680x1050 (15.4). The 17-inch version will most likely remain at 1920x1200.</p>
<p>Both are very thin: 0.11 (thinnest point) to 0.68 inch (thickest point). A unique feature of these MacBook Air notebook PCs is that it is a <em>complete</em> unibody construction including the display chassis. So I imagine these are very rigid.</p>
<p>Both come with Core 2 Duo CPUs, NVIDIA's GeForce 320m, a full-sized keyboard, full-sized glass multi-touch trackpad, FaceTime camera, and solid state storage. Of course, there is no optical drive.</p>
<p>In terms of battery life Apple claims seven hours for the 13.3-inch MacBook Air and five hours for the 11.6.</p>
<p>Pricing is quite aggressive starting at just $999 for the 11.6-inch MacBook Air (1.4GHz C2D 64GB SSD) and $1299 for the 13.3 (1.86GHz C2D 128GB SSD). 2GB RAM is standard.</p>
