<p>Samsung 750 series hybrid HDTV monitor comes in two sizes: 27-inch S27A750D, and the 23-inch S23A750D. Here are the specs <em>via</em> <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20028659-1.html">crave</a>:<br />

<ul>
<li>Pixel Format: 1920x1080</li>
<li>Response Time: 2ms (probably on/off)</li>
<li>Contrast Ratio: 1000:1 (static)</li>
<li>Viewing Angles: 170/160</li>
<li>Backlight: Edge-lit white LED</li>
<li>Color Gamut: 100% sRGB</li><br />
</ul><br />
</font></p>
<p>The industrial design is pure eye candy and exudes an air of high-end. Unfortunately the technology within doesn't quite measure up. Viewing angles are 170/160; those should be 178/178. I would also have liked to see a full LED backlight we sometimes see on high-end LCD TV sets; I think it's about time. And then there's the 27-inch S27A750D sporting a meager 1920x1080 pixel format; it should instead be 2560x1440. A design like this deserves better.</p>
