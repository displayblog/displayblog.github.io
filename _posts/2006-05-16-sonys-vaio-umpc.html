<p>Sony has a <a href="http://www.learningcenter.sony.us/assets/itpd/notebooks/promos/vaio_summer06/index.html" target="_blank">teaser campaign or a viral marketing program</a> going on. After a few blury images pass by it asks: "Is it green, red, orange, or <font color=blue>Blu</font>?" Well, from the way they spelled blu, I'm guessing it has something to do with Blu-ray. But, aren't Blu-ray disks pretty darn big? Too big to fit into a UMPC? Hmm. Maybe they have a mini-Blue-ray disc (8cm?) that they will be showing us. Now, that would be interesting. Well, <a href="http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2006/05/more_sony_ux_pi.html" target="_blank">jkOnTheRun</a> has some pictures up that touts them to be pictures of this new VAIO from Sony, so I had to take a look. The pictures looks pretty authentic but for some reason the keys didn't really show up, so while I was messing around with Photoshop, I inverted it and increased the brightness and contrast way up. What was revealed was what looks like a bunch of retouched portions right around the buttons. Whoever did this Photoshop'ed image is good, but not that good. Besides, if this UMPC has a 7" LCD screen like the others (e.g. Samsung), then there is no way Blu-ray can fit, unless they came out with a 8cm version. Hopefully, I'm wrong and these are real shots of the new VAIO, because I like the way it looks! We shall see tomorrow...</p>
