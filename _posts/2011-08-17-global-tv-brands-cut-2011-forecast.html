<blockquote>
<p>Japan-based vendors have made big cuts to the goals, the sources said. Sony has almost halved its 2011 shipment goal from 40 million units to 23 million.</p></p>
<p>Korea-based Samsung has reduced its 2011 shipment goal to around 36-37 million units, sliding over 25% compared with its original target. LG revised its shipment goal to less than 27 million units in 2011, an over 30% decrease from the initial goal.</p></p>
<p>Philips, Vizio, and Panasonic have also lowered their 2011 shipment goals, the sources noted.</p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>TV brands have been pushing 3D, Internet connectivity, widgets, etc., features that few care about. Combine that with potential customers who are increasingly sensitive to price and you get a big mismatch, growing inventory, and lower sales expectations.</p></p>
