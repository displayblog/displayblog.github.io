<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/24/5747386/watch-tennis-from-roger-federers-perspective-with-google-glass">The Verge</a>. I much prefer watching from the third party perspective: the video quality is significantly better, and I can see what is actually happening. <a href="http://youtu.be/9Eabp3Jpy-I">The view from Federer's perspective</a> is fidgety, devoid of much perspective, and not very interesting.</p>
