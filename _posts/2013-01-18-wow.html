<blockquote><p>Unsourced rumors are just like news, if you use your imagination!</p>
<blockquote><p>If anyone&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the leader in the smartphone market now, it has to be Samsung, which just announced that the Galaxy S3 has sold 40 million units in 7 months. In 2 years and 7 months since its launch, the Galaxy S line has sold over 100 million. Wow.</blockquote></p>
<p>Larry, when coming up with that statistic, did you pause to think for even one second how many iPhones Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s sold over that period? Because it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s more than twice that. FYI.</blockquote></p>
