<p><a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2012/02/17/confirmed-ipad-3-has-a-2048x1536-retina-display/">Eric Slivka</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>MacRumors has now been able to obtain one of these iPad 3 displays and examine it under a microscope in an effort to determine whether it is indeed an ultra-high resolution Retina display.</blockquote></p>
<p>The photo quality is terrible; what kind of microscope was he using? I think we all agree the next iPad, most think it'll be called iPad 3 but I think it'll be <a href="/2011/06/09/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, will sport a 9.7-inch 2048x1536 Retina display. Is the LCD MacRumors was able to obtain the real deal? Not unless I see the model number.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.02.23:</em> <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2012/02/23/ifixit-takes-a-closer-look-at-the-ipad-3-retina-display/">iFixit received the "iPad 3" LCD from MacRumors</a>, took photos of the pixel structure, and confirmed there are four times the number of pixels. What we know now is Apple has been working on a 9.7-inch LCD with a 2048x1536 pixel format. Still no model number.</p>
