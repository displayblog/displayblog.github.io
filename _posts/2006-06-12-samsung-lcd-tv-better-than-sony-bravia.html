<p>Samsung&#39;s Kris Lee, GM of Samsung&#39;s CE Division in the Middle East stated that its LCD TVs are better than Sony&#39;s. S-LCD, a joint venture between the two companies supply both with LCD TV panels including the popular 40" size. Unless Samsung is building special LCD TV modules for its Samsung brand and supplying Sony with normal modules, this cannot be true. Maybe Samsung is secretly building special modules making its newly-minted Bordeaux brands better than Sony&#39;s BRAVIA.</p>
