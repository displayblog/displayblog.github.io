<blockquote><p>The Economic Daily News, citing no sources for its information, said the panels' selling price will be three to four times more than regular panels of the same size, giving a big boost to AU's profit.</p>
<p>AU could ship 30 million of the screens in a year, it said. The order will take up over half the capacity of its plant in Taichung, central Taiwan.</blockquote></p>
<p>Compared to other really cheap 10-inch LCDs that AUO makes the IPS versions are three to four times the price. Not surprising at all. On a different note, Apple probably has strict quality controls for the displays but if I were in the market for an iPad 2 I sure wouldn't want an AUO display in there.</p>
