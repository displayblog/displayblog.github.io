Side by side. In a previous post, <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/15/motorola-droid-x/">Motorola Droid X</a></em>, I made a comment about the physical size limits of smartphones:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m all for big displays, but there is an optimal limit on smartphones since our hands are pretty much fixed in size. I think these bigger-sized smartphones are getting to be less-than comfortable to both hold and put in your pocket. In particular, I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m fairly sure thumb-typing in land&Acirc;&shy;scape mode will be a bit of a stretch for some.</blockquote><br />
Well, the picture above should give you a good idea how much bigger the Droid X is with its 4.3-inch compared to the 3.5-inch packing iPhone 4. The twist is that the smaller 3.5-inch Retina Display (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/09/retina-display/">Retina Display</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/07/iphone-4/">iPhone 4</a></em> for more info) on the iPhone 4 has way more pixels (960x640 vs. 854x480) and way higher resolution (326 PPI vs. 228 PPI). What do you think?</p>
<p>I personally think the Droid X is a bit too big. I have average-sized hands so I think it'll be just a bit uncomfortable if I had to type in landscape mode. Plus pocket-ability is important to me and I think the extra bulge, in all dimensions, will make it disastrous-looking in my jean pocket.

<p><em>Update</em>: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/23/motorola-droid-x-first-official-hands-on-and-unboxing/">Engadget</a> did a hands one with the Droid X at the New York launch event and reported: "You can tell the processor is fast, but the UI still has a jerky quality to it -- it's not totally fluid. We'd say that's more of an Android thing, though." Maybe, hopefully, Froyo (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/23/froyo-in-the-air/">Froyo In The Air</a></em>) will solve those pesky jerky less-than-totally fluid UI.</p>
