<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-15/samsung-said-to-create-apple-team-in-display-unit-to-boost-ties">Jungah Lee, Bloomberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Samsung Electronics Co. created a standalone team of about 200 employees working exclusively on screens for Apple Inc. products [...] The team at Samsung Display Co., which provides screens for iPads and MacBooks, helps develop products and is only allowed to share information about Apple business within the group [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>So say some "people with direct knowledge of the matter". If true, some iPads in the future will not have IPS LCDs? Or will some iPads and MacBooks go OLED? That could be exciting.</p>
