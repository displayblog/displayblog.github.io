<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/27/5035424/apple-presents-video-of-new-headquarters-ahead-of-cupertino-city-council-vote">The Verge</a>: The video starts around the 3:30 mark. It's good to hear Steve Jobs' voice. A couple of other notables: 100% powered by renewable energy, largest solar installation for a corporation, from mostly concrete (20% landscape) to 80% landscape populated with lots of plants and trees that are California native. Apple expects to break ground for Campus 2 later this year.</p>
