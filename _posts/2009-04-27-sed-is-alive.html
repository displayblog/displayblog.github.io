<p>Do you remember <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=sed&amp;sa=Search#1539">SED</a>? SED stands for Surface-conduction Electron-emitter Display. SED technology was developed by Toshiba and Canon that had the picture quality of a CRT but with a thickness of a LCD. As you can see from the diagram above, SED dramatically thins the basic CRT design that generates high picture quality: blacker blacks than even a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=kuro&amp;sa=Search#1219">KURO</a>. SED was thought dead after taking legal bullets from Applied Nano Technologies. But Canon appealed and won and then bought Toshiba's stake in SED. Read "<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/12/02/sed-back-on-track/">SED Back on Track</a>" for the full story.</p>
<p>Now comes news from Peter Putman at Roam Consulting in his Display Daily article "<a href="http://displaydaily.com/2009/04/27/nab-2009-the-season-of-their-discontent/">NAB 2009: The Season of Their Discontent</a>" that SED is alive and well.</p>
<blockquote><p>... a source within Canon told me at the show that the SED is still very much alive as a pro monitor technology. Indeed, a Canon SED engineer from Japan was quietly making the rounds in the Las Vegas Convention Center to scope out the competition.</blockquote><br />
If SED is indeed alive and well, we can expect it to have died a TV and resurrected as a professional monitor for the broadcast market. I'm sure it will be quite expensive: unfortunate, but at least there is hope that some day a SED pro monitor will end up on eBay for a more reasonable price.</p>
