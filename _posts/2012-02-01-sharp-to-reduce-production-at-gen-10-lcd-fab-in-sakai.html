<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/31/us-sharpcorp-idUSTRE80U20020120131">Reuters</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sharp Corp will halve its LCD panel output at its Sakai facility in Osaka in Japan, marking its second deep production cut in a year, hurt by slumping television demand, the Nikkei business daily said.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Sharp Gen 10 LCD fab is the world's largest and according to Reuters can manufacture 1.3 million 40-inch LCD TV panels per month. The reason for the 50% cut in production is increasing inventory due to weak LCD TV sales in Q4'11. On the bright side, <a href="/2011/11/23/sharp-igzo-based-ipad-3-retina-display/">the Gen 6 Kameyama fab might be running at full steam building 2048x1536 9.7-inch IGZO-based LCDs for the next iPad</a>.</p>
