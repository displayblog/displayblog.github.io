<p><a href="http://en.community.dell.com/dell-blogs/Direct2Dell/b/direct2dell/archive/2011/04/26/dell-precision-m4600-and-m6600-mobile-workstations-available-worldwide-may-10.aspx">Dell</a>: The Dell Precision M4600 (15.6 inch) and M6600 (17.3 inch) mobile workstations have a modern, simple industrial design that I appreciate. What excites me even more is that the smaller M4600 can be equipped with a 1920x1080 IPS LCD sporting a RGB LED backlight. This incredible option is called PremierColor.</p>
<p>PremierColor brings two features that are currently lacking in almost all notebook PC displays. First is IPS for In-Plane Switching. IPS exploded into the minds of the everyday user thanks to the iPhone 4 and the iPad. LG Display is the largest manufacturer of IPS LCDs. IPS is considered to be the best LCD technology for color, brightness, and contrast consistency at wide viewing angles.</p>
<p>Second is RGB LED backlight. Most LED backlights use a white LED, which is both easier and cheaper to make. A white LED is generally composed of a blue LED chip and a yellow phosphor coating. Unfortunately the light spectrum generated by a white LED has some limitations: in short distances it gives off a blueish tint and in longer distances it turns into a yellowish tint. Apple even submitted a patent application titled "<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/04/21/apple-patent-application-backlight-unit-color-compensation-techniques/">Backlight Unit Color Compensation Techniques</a>" overcoming this challenge. A RGB LED backlight generates light that is closer to full spectrum resulting in brilliant colors.</p>
<p>The two, IPS and RGB LED backlight, combined should make for one of, if not <em>the</em> best display you can find on a notebook today. I'm not surprised at all to see this on a Dell: previous Precision models had the best display options in the industry.</p>
