<p>[ <a href="http://time.com/4482878/super-mario-run-apple-iphone-shigeru-miytamoto/">TIME</a> ] Shigeru Miyamoto:</p>
<blockquote><p>Of course there are other mobile devices we&rsquo;ll be bringing the game to later. But with the Apple devices, their hardware design is such that there&rsquo;s not much you have to do from a compatibility standpoint across multiple different devices. It&rsquo;s very streamlined. And I think just from a philosophical standpoint, there are elements of their design that are similar to ours. So that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re bringing it to iPhone first.</blockquote><br />
The iPhones you can buy from Apple as of today and in the near future are:</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhone 7</li>
<li>iPhone 7 Plus</li>
<li>iPhone 6s</li>
<li>iPhone 6s Plus</li>
<li>iPhone SE</li><br />
</ul><br />
The iPhone 6s and 7 both feature 4.7-inch displays with a pixel format of 1334x750. The iPhone 7 Plus and the 6s Plus feature 5.5-inch displays with 1920x1080. The iPhone SE sports a 4-inch display with a 1136x640 pixel format. Three pixel formats for five models. Though all five models have roughly 16:9 aspect ratios. From a pixel format or resolution (ppi) perspective the iPhone series is not very streamlined.</p>
<p>And the iPhone 7 series sport a wide color gamut display so colors will look&nbsp;differently than the ones you'll see on the iPhone 6 series and on the iPhone SE.&nbsp;You can 3D Touch all the aforementioned iPhones except the SE. In terms of display hardware the iPhones are quite fragmented, aspect ratio being the exception. Of course iPhones exist alongside Android smartphones, where fragmentation is more pronounced in terms different display hardware and capabilities. Relative to Android smartphones iPhones are indeed streamlined.</p>
<p>The one thing that is definitely streamlined and consistent across all five iPhone models: iOS 10, and maybe that's the most important. All five models&nbsp;can&nbsp;run iOS 10, which will be launched in a few days on September 13.</p>
<p>Miyamoto mentions a similar design philosophy between Nintendo and Apple --&nbsp;I'm guessing simplicity in design? -- as another reason why Nintendo decided to bring <a href="http://supermariorun.com/en/index.html"><em>Super Mario Run</em></a> first to the iPhone.</p>
