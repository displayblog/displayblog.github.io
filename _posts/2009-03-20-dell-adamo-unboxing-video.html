<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/03/20/dell-adamo-hands-on-and-video-unboxing/">Engadget</a>: Joshua Topolsky, Chief Editor at Engadget has posted up an unboxing video of a retail boxed Dell Adamo. My first impressions when viewing the video are: nice, thin, sexy, cool. Nitpicking: The power adapter and cord storage area in the plastic case was a bit underwhelming: Apple does a much better job there. Yes, I know I'm talking about just a power adapter, but with such a highly-anticipated high-end laptop as the Adamo, Dell could have done a bit better.</p>
<p>Next: glare and lots of it! There were a lot of windows directly across from the Adamo and you could see that the glare off of the 13.4" LCD was... extreme. Class Cover: It has that edge-to-edge glass cover giving you the illusion that the LCD is bigger than it actually is (13.4"). Overall I am quite impressed at how Dell has managed to pull a sexy machine like the Adamo out of its hat.</p>
