<p>Tim Bray has joined Google as "Developer Advocate" and shares some thoughts on his blog,&Acirc;&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/03/15/Joining-Google">Now A No-Evil Zone</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The iPhone vision of the mobile Internet's future omits controversy, sex, and freedom, but includes strict limits on who can know what and who can say what.</blockquote><br />
What are you smoking Mr. Bray? Take your iPhone, launch mobile Safari, get to whatever site you want, learn and say anything. <em>via</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/03/15/tim-bray">Daring Fireball</a></p>
