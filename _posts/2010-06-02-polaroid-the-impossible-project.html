Analog gave way to digital and everyone thought Polaroid's future was no more, except for a few including Florian Kaps, an Austrian entrepreneur, and Andr&Atilde;&copy; Bosman, factory manager at Polaroid.&Acirc;&nbsp;Monocle has a <a href="http://www.monocle.com/sections/business/Web-Articles/The-Impossible-Project/">short video</a> of The Impossible Project, the company that has brought back Polaroid's iconic films that will infuse life back into instant photography.</p>
<p>I'm glad analog is back but not because the photo-taking mechanism is analog. What I like most is the result. Look at the picture in this article. It is based on Polaroid's new PX Silver Shade film. It looks and is... authentic.</p>
<p>I have a distaste for Photoshopped photographs, especially when parts of the photographs are completely changed; they may look nice but I consider them something of a fake. I appreciate the flexibility a digital camera offers, namely the near-unlimited exploring I can do by not worrying about how much film I have left, but digital photography too easily allows for fakery. So it is with a sigh of relief to see the rebirth of instant photography. Unfortunately,&Acirc;&nbsp;I don't think instant photography's new-found life will be long lived if it stubbornly clings to its current analog-only form. Most of us have changed and are unwilling to compromise too much; I don't want my photographic explorations to be limited by the film. Allow me to take as many pictures and to print only the ones I want.</p>
<p><strong>Another Impossible Project:</strong> This is what I propose: build a hybrid analog-digital camera using these new wonderful films. Allow for photographic exploration by adding storage and a display. Tune the display based on the film that is inside the camera so I can see what it will look like if I print it. Give me and others the opportunity to buy this camera in the not-too-distant future and I must believe The Impossible Project will earn fortunes. Just as importantly maybe more, it will give those who love photography another outlet to be authentic and without limits to photographic exploration.</p>
