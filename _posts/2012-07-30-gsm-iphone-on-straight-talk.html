<p><a href="http://9to5mac.com/2012/07/30/review-the-iphone-on-straight-talk/">Mike Beasley, 9to5 Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Overall, Straight Talk is one of the best iPhone carriers available. The Straight Talk network is pulling from AT&T&acirc;&euro;&trade;s network, so you get full-speed access to nationwide HSPA+, unlimited calling, texting, MMS, and data for less than the cost of a far more limited plan with a post-paid carrier (as well as the convenience of never having to sign a contract). There are a few downsides to using an unofficial carrier, such as the lack of visual voicemail for those who rely heavily on that feature, but the benefits and price seem to far outweigh the downsides.</blockquote></p>
<p>$45 per month for unlimited data, messaging, and calling. No visual voicemail; no biggie. Sounds like a good deal to me.</p>
