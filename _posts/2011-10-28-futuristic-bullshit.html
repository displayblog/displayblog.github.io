<p>I actually liked the translucent/transparent refrigerator door: you don't have to open the frig door to find out what you need to get from the grocery store. You keep the frig cool, save energy, and money. Of course money shouldn't be a concern for anyone thinking of buying something like this when it first comes out.</p>
