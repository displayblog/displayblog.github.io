<p><a href="http://furbo.org/2014/09/24/in-app-browsers-considered-harmful/">Craig Hockenberry</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>How many apps on your iPhone or iPad have a built-in browser?</p>
<p>Would it surprise you to know that every one of those apps could eavesdrop on your typing? Even when it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s in a secure login screen with a password field?</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>You should <strong>never</strong> enter any private information while you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re using an app that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not Safari.</p>
<p>An in-app browser is a great tool for quickly viewing web content, especially for things like links in Twitterrific&acirc;&euro;&trade;s timeline. But if you should always open a link in Safari if you have any concern that your information might be collected. Safari is the only app on iOS that comes with Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s guarantee of security.</blockquote></p>
