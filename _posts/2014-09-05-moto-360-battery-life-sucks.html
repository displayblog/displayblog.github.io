<p>Joanna Stern, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/moto-360-review-one-size-doesnt-fit-all-1409896802?mod=ST2">The Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Motorola says it is working on smaller versions, but that makes me concerned about battery life: Even this big, honking model had to be charged twice a day. Most days, after charging it overnight, I had to put it back on its wireless charging cradle by 4 p.m. If only the large black circle could also work as a sundial so I could still tell the time when the battery dies.</blockquote></p>
<p>A watch that needs to be charged midday?</p>
