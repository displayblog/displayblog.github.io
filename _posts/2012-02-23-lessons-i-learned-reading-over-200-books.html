<p><a href="http://inoveryourhead.net/lessons-i-learned-reading-over-200-books/">Julien Smith</a> read one book per week for five years and shared his  140-character CliffsNotes. Here's just a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>How To Succeed in Anything by Really Trying</em> by Lyman MacInnis: The three A's of careers are Ability, Ambition, and Attitude. If you have those three down, you're good.</li>
<li><em>The Dip</em> by Seth Godin: The real rewards come to those who can outlast the competition. If you can do that while staying unique, you win.</li>
<li><em>On Writing Well</em> by William Zinsser: Simplicity matters. Clarity matters. "Writing improves in direct ratio to the number of things we can keep out of it."</li>
<li><em>What Should I Do With My Life?</em> by Po Bronson: Follow your passion or you'll regret it. Speaking from experience, this is true.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Good stuff.</p>
