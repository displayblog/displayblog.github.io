<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/06/15/leaked-olympus-ep-1-micro-four-thirds-compact-has-us-hot-bother/">Engadget</a>: It seems Olympus has a winner in the E-P1, a Micro Four Thirds system-based compact digital camera that brings DSLR-like picture quality and flexibility into a compact digital camera body. The E-P1 might be a game changer and will target enthusiasts that want more from a compact camera but don't want to carry around large and heavy DLSRs. The E-P1 can potentially replace that bulky DSLR for good. Potentially.</p>
<p>Sounds a bit high to me after <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/03/09/olympus-akira-watanabe-12-megapixels-enough/">Akira Watanabe stated that 12 megapixels are enough</a>. Hopefully more pixels in this case does not mean less quality. The E-P1 can output all those pixels in RAW. 720p (1280 x 720) video can be captured too. Hopefully at 30fps. Storage is via SD. <em>Update:</em> The total pixel count on the Live MOS sensor is 13.1 megapixels with an effective 12.3 megapixels.</p>
<p>There seems to be two lenses currently available: 17mm &AElig;&rsquo;2.8 prime lens and a new 14-42mm (28-84mm equivalent) &AElig;&rsquo;3.5-5.6 zoom. There is also an optical viewfinder. Not much is known about the LCD that is used. The prime lens is fast but let's see something faster, around &AElig;&rsquo;1.8. Zoom? I'll need to see longer ranges and faster ones for Olympus to convince me the E-P1 has got the chops. Image stabilization (electronic or optical) would be nice too. <em>Update:</em> The E-P1 has 3-inch LCD and in-body image stabilization.</p>
<p>To get me to open up my wallet the E-P1 will need to work really well in low-light environments (ISO800 with no grain, the E-P1 can get up to 6400) with near-instant shutter response. Olympus is scheduled to announce the E-P1 tomorrow with an expected ship date of July for about US$900. <em>Update:</em> Prices will be US$749 for body only; US$799 with the 14-42mm; and US$899 with the 17mm and viewfinder.</p>
