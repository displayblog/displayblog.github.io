<blockquote><p>The Wednesday, November 24th edition of amNewYork will be the first US-based newspaper to present its readers with an augmented reality feature for its Thanksgiving addition. Sections of amNewYork will feature animated features that will enable Readers to watch the Macy`s Thanksgiving Day balloons float off the paper and reveal answers to their daily crossword puzzle.</blockquote></p>
