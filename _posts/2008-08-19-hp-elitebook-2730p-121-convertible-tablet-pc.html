<p>The Gobi feature allows you to connect via EV-DO or HSPA and literally enables worldwide connectivity. Of course, you'll be paying quite a considerable sum for the privilege. Another interesting feature that HP is pushing is the business card reader software that makes use of the 2MP webcam to take pictures of business cards. I believe it has some OCR capabilities. Pretty nifty for folks that exchange a lot of business cards. The 2730p looks to be a pretty impressive travel companion. Just get the biggest battery and opt for the 1.86GHz CPU. And bear in mind that it has faster 5400RPM 1.8" HDDs so it won't slow you down as much as say a MacBook Air.</p>
