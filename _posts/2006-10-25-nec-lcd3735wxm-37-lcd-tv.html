<p>NEC's LCD3735WXM is a 37" LCD TV with 1366 x 768 resolution, 1600:1 contrast ratio, and 9ms response time. The LCD3735WXM (what an interesting model name!) sports an ATSC tuner (that means you can get HD from your antenna right out of the box), VGA (for your computer), DVI+HDCP (so you don't copy stuff) and S-Video input (for your future iTV from Apple, I guess). The price is a bit much, in my opinion, at $2300. Because of the 1366 x 768 resolution, every single HD source, whether it is 720p or 1080i will need to be scaled. I hope this has a good scaler chip because it'll be used all the time. $2300 is a bit too much for a 1366 x 768 box at 37". Wait for 1920 x 1080 at 37" for sub-$1500 pricing by major brands later this year.&Acirc;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/10/25/nec-lcd3735wxm-joins-the-37-incher-club/"></a></p>

<p>The external design looks fairly nice, but I would get rid of that white outline. I have no doubt that white line will be a distraction. There is a reason why most designs are all black just around the screen. Also, what are those ugly flaps? Integrate the speakers: I like listening to sound, but have no intention of looking at them. One last thing: Where's the HDMI port?</p>
