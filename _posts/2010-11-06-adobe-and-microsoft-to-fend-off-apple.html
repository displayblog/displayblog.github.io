<p><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/microsoft-and-adobe-chiefs-meet-to-discuss-partnerships/">The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>One person familiar with the discussion said the two companies had talked about the blockade that Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, had placed on Adobe&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Flash software for its handheld devices and whether a partnership by Adobe and Microsoft could fend off Apple, which continues to grow at juggernaut speeds.</blockquote></p>
<p>Adobe got pissed off at Apple because of Flash. Microsoft wants to crush Apple in the smartphone market. There are two problems with Flash on mobile devices: performance and battery life. Even with the latest hardware Flash video can be jerky, game controls are awkward, the overall system slows down and battery life suffers. <a href="http://blog.laptopmag.com/mobile-flash-fail-weak-android-player-proves-jobs-right#axzz14ZnSlI78">Laptop</a> regarding Flash Player 10.1:</p>
<blockquote><p>Based on my early experience with Flash Player 10.1 for mobile, it could soon join the floppy drive in the tech graveyard, something else Steve Jobs helped kill.</blockquote></p>
<p>Windows Phone 7 + Flash sounds like it would be the wrong decision for Microsoft.</p>
