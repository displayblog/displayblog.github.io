<p>Quanta Display Inc. (QDI) will be no more when October 1 comes around. That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s because AU Optronics (AUO) bought them. Now, as with any merger, AUO will need to trim the fat and out goes QDI&acirc;&euro;&trade;s surface mounting technology (SMT) lines. AUO is planning to sell 19 SMT lines to Taiwan Surface Mounting Technology (TSMT - what a creative name BTW!). AUO and TSMT has not come to a definitive agreement but is in talks at the moment. The SMT lines are located at an LCD module plant in Shanghai. If the deal goes through, TSMT will become the largest supplier of SMT in Taiwan.</p>
