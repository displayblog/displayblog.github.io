<p><a href="http://campl.us/posts/Low-Light">Lisa Bettany</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is a huge jump in the sharpness, level of detail, and noise levels between the iPhone 4 and 4S. [...] It's clear that the iPhone 4S's f/2.4 wider aperture lens coupled with it's newly-optimized sensor allows it to out perform all previous models in low-light.</blockquote></p>
