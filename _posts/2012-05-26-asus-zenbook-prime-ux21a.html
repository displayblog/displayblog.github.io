<p><a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/5843/asus-zenbook-prime-ux21a-review/4">Anand Lai Shimpi, AnandTech</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Max brightness is down a bit compared to the previous generation, but it's still higher than any of the portable Macs and much higher than your typical PC displays. Black levels are much improved over the original Zenbook as well:</blockquote></p>
<p>The ASUS Zenbook Prime UX21A is a 11.6-inch second generation ultrabook sporting a 1920x1080 pixel format, good for a resolution of 189 ppi. The LCD is top notch. Black levels at 0.45 nits is behind only the Razer Blade's 0.31 nits, and ahead of both MacBook Airs. With decent brightness and superb black levels the Zenbook Prime tops the contrast ratio chart at 939:1. It's the same story with Delta E: At 1.2 it's head and shoulders above the competition.</p>
<p>The only weakness, if you can call it that, is the 64.5% AdobeRGB color gamut. It only seems weak because of the incredible high levels exhibited by the Razer Blade (84.6%), 15.4-inch MacBook Pro (74.7%), and ASUS N56VM (72.7%). The real weakness is Windows 7:</p>
<blockquote><p>There's not much you can do to work around this today with Windows 7. You're either going to have really small text or have to deal with funny scaling. This is unfortunately a major downside to not controlling the OS layer, ASUS is at the mercy of Microsoft to get scaling for displays with high pixel densities right.</blockquote></p>
<p>DPI scaling on operating systems, including OS X, will continue to be a challenge unless bitmapped UI elements are completely replaced with vector graphics.</p>
