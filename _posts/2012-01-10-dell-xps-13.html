<p><a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/5356/dell-launches-xps-13-ultrabook">Dustin Sklavos, AnandTech</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Much like the XPS 14z was able to fit a 14&acirc;&euro; screen inside a 13&acirc;&euro; chassis, Dell has fit a 13&acirc;&euro; screen inside the XPS 13&acirc;&euro;&trade;s 12&acirc;&euro; chassis. The result is a notebook with a design that feels like it maximizes the space available to it, with a full-sized keyboard and a large screen with a small bezel. Some may complain about the 13&acirc;&euro; screen&acirc;&euro;&trade;s low 1366x768 resolution, but at that size the resolution is perfectly reasonable.</blockquote></p>
<p>And reasonable is what sells, I'm sure. In terms of displays, the absolute minimum requirement for a high-end 13-inch ultrabook is 1440x900, with solid vertical viewing angles, 300+ nits, and decent colors. The XPS 13 doesn't cut it.</p>
