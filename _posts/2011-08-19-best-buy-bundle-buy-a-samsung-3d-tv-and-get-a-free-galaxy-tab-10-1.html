<blockquote>
<p>[...] Best Buy's turning to the age-old "bundling" technique to try and move some inventory. Next week, if you buy certain Samsung-brand 3D TVs, the big box retailer will toss in a Galaxy Tab 10.1, too.</p><br />

<p>Two things many haven't shown much interest in buying. Now bundled together. Genius.</p></p>
