<p>During IFA 2007, Tatung showcased its V42MMFJ-ETA, a 42" 720p LCD TV with 100Hz. As with digital cameras, most companies are focused on getting everything to 1080p, even though there is very little content. Even though scaling technology that upscales from SD, ED, 720p, and 1080i to 1080p is poor in general and to get it right requires a hefty investment in chips and software algorithms, companies continue to push 1080p and claims that the purchase will future proof the consumer. I don't know when we'll see a lot of 1080p content, like we see DVD content today. My guess is it will take a very long time. Well, Tatung seems to be moving in a slightly different direction.</p>
<p>Tatung's V42MMFJ-ETA is a 720p (1366 x 768) 42" LCD TV that is focused on performance. By doubling the frequency from the standard 50Hz to 100Hz, motion blur is reduced to very little, if at all, depending on how keen your eyes are. Scaling DVD content to 720p is a lot less hassle than to 1080p and you'll get to watch ESPN HD without scaling at all as it is broadcasted in 720p. Because there is a sizeable gap in panel prices between 1366 x 768 and 1920 x 1080 LCDs, Tatung's offering shouldn't cost that much and just slightly more than standard 50Hz 42" LCD TVs and quite a bit less than 1080p 42" LCD TVs.</p>
