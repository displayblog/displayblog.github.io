<blockquote>
<p>Non-Apple tablet PC players, facing the fact their devices are having weaker sales than their order volumes, while demand from the retail channel has been quickly shrinking, are expected to start cutting their tablet prices by the end of September to digest inventory and minimize losses, and the decisions are expected to trigger a new price war within the tablet industry, according to sources from notebook players.</p><br />

<p>With the rumor that a new iPad will be announced next month, it would be doubly difficult to move competing tablets. Now would be a good time to slash prices to clear inventory for Acer, Asustek, HTC, Motorola, RIM, Samsung, etc. HP has already dropped the starting price of its TouchPad from $499 to $399.</p></p>
