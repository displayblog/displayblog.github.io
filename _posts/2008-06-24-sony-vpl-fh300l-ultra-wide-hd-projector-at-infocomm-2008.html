<p>Sony's VPL-FH300L is a monster. When I was at InfoComm 2008 and walked by this huge machinery, I was a bit surprised to realize that it was a projector, a saucer-like projector. The VPL-FH300L boasts a pixel format of 2048 x 1080, two 1080p images side-by-side.</p>
<p>Sony incorporated its BrightEra technology that makes use of an inorganic alignment layer that feature stronger bonding of molecules to make the HTPS LCD panel more resistant to damage from ultra-violet rays and light in general. This technology becomes an important part of the projector since brighter and more reliable projection systems are demanded.</p>

<p>The VPL-FH300L feature a 6,000 lumens of brightness, which is extremely bright and is positioned between standard business projectors and Sony's 4K large-venue systems.</p>
