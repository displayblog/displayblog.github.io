<p>Thank you so much for making displayblog.wordpress.com your source of display information for the past several months. DisplayBlog now has its own domain at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com">www.displayblog.com</a></p>
<p>Please update your bookmarks and visit DisplayBlog often! Thank you...</p>

<p>PS (2006.09.28 17:10 PST):&Acirc;&nbsp; I thought after I had stopped updating this site that viewers would drop down to almost nothing, but many (and I mean MANY) of you kept on coming back to find information about displays. So I have decided to mirror the posts that I update on www.displayblog.com here. I hope this helps all of you in finding information about displays and I truly appreciate all of you for making DisplayBlog one of your many destinations for display information!</p>
