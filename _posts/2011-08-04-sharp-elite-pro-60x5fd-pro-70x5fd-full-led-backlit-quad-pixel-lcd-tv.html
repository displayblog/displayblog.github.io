<p>Earlier this year, Sharp announced that it had licensed the Elite brand name from Pioneer. According to that <a href="http://www.sharpusa.com/AboutSharp/NewsAndEvents/PressReleases/2011/January/2011_01_27_ELITE.aspx">press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sharp Electronics Corporation, the U.S. subsidiary of Japan&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Sharp Corporation, and Pioneer Electronics (USA) Inc. today announced that Sharp will be granted license of Pioneer&acirc;&euro;&trade;s &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Elite&acirc;&euro;¬ù brand for a line of high-end flat panel displays to be introduced in the U.S. and Canada this year.</blockquote></p>
<p>Well, Sharp has done just that with two Elite-branded high-end LCD TVs: the 60-inch Pro-60X5FD and the 70-inch Pro-70X5FD. Listed are some noteworthy specs from <a href="http://www.sharpusa.com/AboutSharp/NewsAndEvents/PressReleases/2011/August/2011_08_04_Elite_Press_Release.aspx">Sharp's announcement</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>RGB+Y: Or Quad-Pixel technology that adds a yellow sub-pixel to red, green, and blue. Sharp calls it Quattron, but isn't using that sub-brand on these Elites.</li>
<li>Scanning Backlight: Using a "unique scanning backlight technology" the overall refresh rate of the LED-backlit LCD has an effect greater than 240Hz.</li>
<li>Full Array LED: Instead of the typical cost-saving lower-performance edge-lit LED backlight, Sharp incorporated a direct-lit full LED backlight. This allows for more precise local dimming resulting in better contrast by making blacks really black.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>The Pro-60X5FD has a US$5999.99 MSRP while the larger Pro-70X5FD is $8499.99. Hop on over to the <a href="http://elitelcdtv.com/">Elite microsite</a> for more info.</p>
