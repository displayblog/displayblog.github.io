<blockquote><p>What most users don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t know is that the new features being introduced are all centered around increasing the value of Facebook to advertisers, to the point where Facebook representatives have been selling the idea that Timeline is actually about re-conceptualizing users around their consumer preferences, or as they put it, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;brands are now an essential part of people&acirc;&euro;&trade;s identities.&acirc;&euro;¬ù</blockquote></p>
<p>Google gathers your online activities, analyzes them, and sells to the highest bidding advertiser. Facebook sells <em>you</em>.</p>
