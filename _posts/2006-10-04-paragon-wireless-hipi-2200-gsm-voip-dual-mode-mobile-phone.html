<p>Paragon Wireless launched the Hipi 2200, a Windows Mobile 5.0 mobile phone that can make calls via Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) VoIP or regular GSM/GPRS networks (850, 900, 1800, 1900). The Hipi 2200 will effortlessly hop between GSM and WiFi networks, claims Paragon.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, portions of the keypad resembles Motorola&acirc;&euro;&trade;s RAZR. The Hipi 2200 has a 1.9&acirc;&euro;&sup3; TFT LCD with 176 x 220 resolution, a Texas Instruments&acirc;&euro;&trade; OMAP 730 CPU, and a 2.0 megapixel camera. The battery is a 1100 mAh LiOn battery that can fuel the Hipi 2200 for 4 hours of talk time and 100 hours standby. Expansion slots include TransFlash or microSD. The unit looks very nice, but with so much power and the ability to connect to really fast WiFi networks, I would think a QWERTY keyboard would be a must.</p>
