<blockquote><p>Called HBO Now, it is a stand-alone version of HBO Go, an app that gives access to just about every episode of every HBO series, as well as tons of movies, documentaries, and sports. Rather than merely being a bonus for people who subscribe to HBO through an existing cable provider, HBO Now will not require a cable subscription. It will be available at launch to anyone with an Apple device.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/appletv/hbo-now/">US$14.99 per month</a>. This might be the most affordable way to watch <i>Game of Thrones</i>. One interesting tidbit in the article was HBO's decision to play catchup with Netflix by outsourcing the development of Now's back-end technology to MLB Advanced Media.</p>
