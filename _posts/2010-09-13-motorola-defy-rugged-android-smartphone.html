<p><a href="http://www.motorola.com/Consumers/XW-EN/Consumer-Products-and-Services/Mobile-Phones/MOTOROLA-DEFY-XW-EN">Motorola</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Motorola DEFY is scratch and water resistant as well as dust proof, protecting you from life's little challenges such as a sudden rain shower to a drop in the sand.</blockquote></p>
<p>I like rugged phones. I used the Casio CanU 502 waterproof phone while I was in Korea, during the monsoon season. I didn't worry one bit whether it was drenched in rain, dropped on concrete or had kalbi sauce splattered all over it.</p>
<p>If you want an Android smartphone <em>and</em> a bit of ruggedness I think the Motorola Defy has got your number. I don't see any MIL-SPEC numbers so I don't think the Defy is going to be as tough as the Casio or a tank from Sonim, but Corning's Gorilla Glass provides impact and scratch resistance for the display.</p>
<p>The specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>3.7-inch 854x480 16:9 capacitive touch TFT LCD (most likely IPS)</li>
<li>5MP camera with LED flash</li>
<li>Web browser with Adobe Flash Lite 3</li>
<li>Android 2.1 likely, probably upgradeable to 2.2</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Unfortunately Motoblur is included.</p>
