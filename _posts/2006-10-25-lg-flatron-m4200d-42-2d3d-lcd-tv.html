<p>LG's Flatron (the sub-brand used in Korea and other Asian countries) M4200D has a Full HD resolution of 1920 x 1080, 500 cd/m2 of brightness, a 8ms response time, and a 1600:1 contrast ratio. All very good specifications. The 3D comes from using an auto-stereoscopic image and does not require the use of nerdy 3D glasses. You will have to stand/sit back about 3-7m (meters!) to properly see the 3D effect. I personally don't like 3D displays because they are just not up to snuff, in my opinion. Give me a really nice 2D and I will figure out the 3D portions of it.</p>
