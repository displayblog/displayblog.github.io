<p><a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1670003/how-jake-dysons-little-design-firm-developed-a-light-that-lasts-50-years#1">Mark Wilson, Co.Design</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Whereas most of the market has leveraged lousy design to turn LEDs into a disposable product, Dyson wanted to elevate the LED to a post-disposable electronic treasure, an heirloom light that could be passed from one generation to another. And it was theoretically possible, he knew, if only he could deal with the pesky heat issue.</blockquote></p>
<p>Heat pipes. 160,000 hours of sustained light. US$900.</p>
