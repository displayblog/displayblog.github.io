<blockquote>
<p>The Grid 10 comes in a 16:9 aspect ratio with a 10.1-inch screen. Fusion Garage is proud of that screen&acirc;&euro;&trade;s 1366 x 768 resolution and while it deserves credit for upping the pixel density, in general the panel doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t rise above your middle-of-the-road Android tablet. The viewing angles on the display are downright terrible and the panel itself feels a little plasticky &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re told it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s some sort of special mix of polycarbonate and glass.

<p>The folks at Fusion Garage was on the right track with the Grid 10 by cramming 1366x768 pixels and thereby improving resolution. Unfortunately, you can't get away from having poor viewing angles on a tablet. <em>Instant</em> touch responsiveness is another one of those requirements. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/08/17/very-very">John Gruber</a>:</p></p>

<p>If my iPad&acirc;&euro;&trade;s pinch-to-zoom were that choppy, I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d take it back to the Apple Store, because I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d know there was something seriously wrong with it.</p><br />

<p>Gruber is referring to Bohn's video at 1:24:</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pinch-to-zoom action is very, very responsive.</p><br />

<blockquote><p>It appears that the wild story of Fusion Garage has come to a sadly ignominious close: the manufacturer of the failed JooJoo and Grid10 tablets has all but disappeared, leaving behind only a database error on its website and a US PR firm that is quitting it representation effective tomorrow.</blockquote></p>
