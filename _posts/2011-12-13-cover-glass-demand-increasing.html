<blockquote><p>Demand for cover glass is set to increase significantly as the application of touch-controlled technology has expanded to include large-size panels for outdoor advertising windows, vending machines, transparent advertisement glass, in addition to notebooks and tablet PCs, according to industry sources.</blockquote></p>
<p>At the end of Q1'12 Foxconn affiliate G-Tech Optoelectronics, a cover glass manufacturer, will commence production of its AR (anti-reflective) coating lines that can support up to Gen 7.5 sizes. I'm all for AR, AG (anti-glare), and oleophobic coatings on cover glasses.</p>
