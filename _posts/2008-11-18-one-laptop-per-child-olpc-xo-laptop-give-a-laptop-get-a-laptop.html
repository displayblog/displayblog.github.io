  href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=olpc\">OLPC</a> is running
  its \"Give a Laptop, Get a Laptop\" program again this year. The <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=xo-laptop\">XO
  laptop</a> has a lot of innovative features including a dual-mode LCD. The LCD
  can be used in color mode or black and white mode. Black and white mode is used
  when you want to read text and generates a lot more resolution than the color mode.
  The 7.5\" LCD in color mode (and using the backlight) has a pixel format of <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=800-x-600\">800
  x 600</a>. The reflective black and white mode (the backlight is off) gets a
  pixel format of <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1200-x-900\">1200
  x 900</a>. Like traditional convertible <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=tablet-pc\">tablet</a>s,
  the LCD can be pivoted around and folded to use it in slate mode. There is a dedicated
  button on the bezel that rotates the screen 90 degrees at a time. The XO also has
  a built-in webcam at 0.3MP, kind of lacking in pixels if you ask me, even for kids
  nowadays. "

<p>One thing that I really like about the XO is that it is silent. Completely silent. Even Apple's MacBooks are noisy in comparison. But hardware specifications aside, OLPC's mission to "create educational opportunities for the world's poorest children by providing each child with a rugged, low-cost, low-power, connected laptop..." is bold and good. Personally, I do think that needy children the world over are more in need of basic necessities such as clean water, food, and most importantly adults who love and care for them. Hop on over to Amazon (<a href="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=displ0f-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;asins=B001GB87EI&amp;fc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank&amp;m=amazon&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;bc1=FFFFFF&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;f=ifr">click the link at the bottom or right here</a>) and send a child the opportunity to learn and get yourself an XO laptop in the process.</p>
<p>David Pogue, New York Time's technology columnist, who creates pretty interesting videos about technology products has a review of the XO laptop. Have a look:</p>
