<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=samsung">Samsung</a> has announced the first commercially available <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=40"">40"</a> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a> with a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led-backlight">LED backlight</a> echewing the traditional CCFL-based backlight. CCFL has been the king of backlight but is now being challenged with LED. LED has advantages: very slow degradation of light output through 50,000 hours versus CCFL's slow but sure decline. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led">LED</a> also provides much better color gamut that can exceed 100% NTSC. CCFL, with recent developments, have reached 92% NTSC with traditional CCFL's at 72%. The LE40M91, however, limits the excitement with a low resolution of only 1366 x 768. Although <a href="http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=4072">DailyTech</a> is reporting that the color gamut is 146%, I highly doubt it is that high. I am sure it is wrong because the article states a typical color gamut of 127%, which is absolutely not correct. Contrast ratio is 10,000:1 but this is based on actively managing the backlight to enhance contrast ratio (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dynamic-contrast">dynamic contrast</a>). Non-managed (static) contrast ratio would be around 1000:1 at best. Brightness is at a standard 450 cd/m2.</p>

<p>What I would have liked better is to see a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a> resolution screen. Samsung is clearly targeting high-end consumers by using a modern LED-based backlight system. But then Samsung degrades the model by applying it to a very low-specification 1366 x 768 screen. As I have mentioned many times before, at 1366 x 768 every single source of video whether it is SD or HD will need to be scaled--decreasing the video quality. Up-sampling 1080i content to 1080p and then completely filling the beautiful screen would have been a better choice.</p>
