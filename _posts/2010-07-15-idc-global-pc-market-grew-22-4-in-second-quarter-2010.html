<p>According to IDC's Worldwide Quarterly PC Tracker (<a href="http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS22421910">press release</a>) the global PC market grew 22.4% Y/Y to 81.5 million units in the second quarter of 2010. Actual growth was slightly less than the forecasted growth 22.9% Y/Y. Desktop PC shipments exceeded expectations while portable PCs came less than forecasted.</p>
<p>IDC points this growth to a sign that commercial customers have started the upgrade cycle despite slowing demand from consumers. Bob O'Donnell, IDC vice president for Clients and Displays, expects consumer demand to continue slowing through the end of the year with stable growth in demand from the commercial market.</p>
<p>The United States: 12.6% Q/Q. Less than the almost 18% Q/Q growth expected. Due to a wait-and-see approach by the commercial sector. Lower-pricing based growth can be limited due to slow overall economic growth and rising costs.</p>
<p>Asia Pacific Excluding Japan: This is where growth came from as the region gained almost 15% Q/Q and 35% Y/Y in the second quarter. Desktop PC volume was strong while portable PC shipments came in less than expected, though still managed double-digit growth in nearly all countries in the region.</p>
<p>Globally, HP was #1 growing 12.2% Y/Y to 14.77 million PCs shipped in the second quarter and took a market share of 18.1%. Dell followed at #2 growing 19.1% Y/Y to 10.62 million and 13% share. Rounding out the top three was Acer up 20.8% Y/Y to 10.24 million and 12.6% share. The rankings for the top three in the US was the same. Interestingly Apple was at #4 in the US growing 15.4% Y/Y to 1.62 million units capturing a market share of 8.8%.</p>
