<p><a href="http://www.ortustech.co.jp/english/news/20101026.html">Ortus Technology</a> crammed 1920x1080 pixels into a 4.8-inch LCD for a resolution of 458 ppi.</p>
<blockquote><p>ORTUSTECH newly developed LCD, however, is based on the company&acirc;&euro;&trade;s original HAST (Hyper-amorphous silicon TFT) technology, which permits higher resolution and a higher aperture ratio. Combined with optimal design under minute manufacturing technology, LCD rubbing technology and panel driving technology, the result is the new 4.8-inch LCD with small size screen and Full HD. The natural and three-dimensional power of expression is realized by achieving overwhelming higher resolution (458 ppi), which exceed discrimination limit of a human&acirc;&euro;&trade;s eye.</blockquote></p>
<p>The 4.8-inch LCD is an 8-bit panel good for 16.8 million colors and sports a 72% NTSC color gamut. These two features leapfrog almost all mobile displays including those found on notebook PCs where the LCDs are limited to 6-bit. Viewing angles are good at 160/160 but not excellent.</p>
