<p>I thought Buffalo only did networking stuff. That's if you go to their US website, but if you go to its Japanese site with the aid of Google's translation services, you can see that they not only make networking gear (like the Terastation), they also make a bunch of LCD monitors. A lot of other sites are reporting the 19" wide LCD monitor, but Buffalo makes much more than that:</p>

<p>FTD-W2023ADSR / FTD-W2023ADSR/BK: 20" wide LCD monitors with 1680 x 1050 resolution using Multidomain Vertical Alignment (MVA) panels. It has a 800:1 contrast ratio, 300 cd/m2 of brightness and 176-degrees of viewing angle. It also has 8ms grey-to-grey (GTG) response times that gives a better front screen performance for videos. The units come with both DVI and VGA connections.</p>

<p>FTD-914ADS / FTD-G914ADS/BK: 19" LCD monitors with 1280 x 1024 resolution, 60/75/70/70 (U/D/L/R) viewing angles, 550:1 contrast ratio, and 270 cd/m2. Speakers are built-in.</p>
<p>In addition to these monitors, Buffalo has many more models. Jump to <a href="http://www.buffalo.jp/">Buffalo</a> for more information.</p>
