<p>Sharp announced its 52- and 60-inch AQUOS Quattron 3D LE925 Series LCD TVs at CEDIA. The 52-inch 52LE925 sports an edge-lit LED backlight and starts at US$4199. The larger 60LE925 is $5299. Thankfully 3D glasses, two of them, are included. You can use the built-in Ethernet port or the optional WiFi adapter to get content from Netflix, VUDU and other sources. With the USB port you can alsp playback DivX video. Sharp claims the fourth yellow primary color offsets the dimming that usually comes (free) with 3D. I think the price is too high, even though you get an extra primary color and 3D with two pairs of glasses.
