<blockquote><p>Well, Sony has certainly been doing interesting things. A 1-inch sensor in a pocket camera? Never been done. A premium superzoom? Nobody else is doing that. A full-frame sensor in a coat-pocketable body? Unheard of.</blockquote></p>
<p>Interesting, yes, but if Sony squeezed that 1-inch image sensor found in the company's excellent RX100 compact camera inside an Xperia smartphone, I'd be thoroughly impressed. I'd also be severely tempted to ditch my iPhone as my primary camera.</p>
