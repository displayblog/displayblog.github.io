<p><a href="http://gdgt.com/discuss/why-the-new-ipad-s-retina-display-matters-16kb/">Ryan Block</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>So when a device comes along like the iPad that doesn't just display the application, but actually becomes the application, radically improving its screen radically improves the experience. And when a device's screen is as radically improved as the display in the new iPad, the device itself is fundamentally changed.</blockquote></p>
<p>A new display. A new world. In a few days I'll get to see it with my own two eyes.</p>
