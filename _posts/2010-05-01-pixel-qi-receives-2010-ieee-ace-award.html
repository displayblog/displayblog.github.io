<p>Pixel Qi received the award for "Emerging technology offering the greatest potential for financial success." Kudos.</p>

<blockquote><p>Our initial manufacturing partner did get slowed down in the midst of the economic crises and that did effect our ability to ramp to the schedule our higher volume customers wanted. We are beyond this now thanks to strong pull from these customers: some of the largest computer companies in the world and also from the broader community who want our screens now! We are scaling to multiple manufacturers (and beginning to ramp production) to the meet the strong demand.</blockquote></p>
