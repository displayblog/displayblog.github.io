<p>Apple announced on June 28th that it has sold over 1.7 million iPhone 4's in just three days from June 24th to June 26th (source: <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iphone-4-sales-top-17-million-97297679.html">PR Newswire</a>). One iPhone 4 sold every 0.15 seconds during that time frame. Did I do that math right? That's <em>insane</em>. Steve Jobs:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is the most successful product launch in Apple's history. Even so, we apologize to those customers who were turned away because we did not have enough supply.</blockquote><br />
That's good news for Apple but I would like to hear an official statement from Apple what it intends to do with the yellow ugliness (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/23/yellow-discoloration-on-iphone-4-lcd/">Yellow Discoloration on iPhone 4 LCD</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/25/iphone-4-yellowish-discoloration-goes-away-with-time/">iPhone 4 Yellowish Discoloration Goes Away With Time?</a></em>) on some Retina Displays and the reception issue (search "<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?s=iphone+4+antenna">iphone 4 antenna</a>" for all related posts) before I buy. And I'm staying tuned.</p>
