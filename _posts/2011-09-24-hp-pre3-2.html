<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/09/24/pre-3-for-atandt-review/">Darren Murph at Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[...] the 3.6-inch WVGA touchpanel is the best display yet on a Pre. Colors pop from edge to edge, viewing angles are on par with any Super AMOLED Plus display we've seen and sharpness is superb. Granted, cramming an 800 x 480 pixel matrix onto a display this diminutive amps up the pixel density, but still -- there's no bad-mouthin' this guy.</blockquote></p>
<p>I believe the 3.58-inch 8-bit LCD sports IPS technology. The resolution at 260.6 ppi would have been higher than any other smartphone on the market except for the iPhone 4*. Only the rumored <a href="/2011/09/19/lg-lu6200-optimus-lte-4-5-inch-1280x720-ah-ips-lcd/">LG LU6200 Optimus LTE</a> matches the Retina Display in terms of resolution, but with a larger 4.5-inch AH-IPS LCD and a 1280x720 pixel format.</p>
<p><em>Update: </em> The HTC Touch Pro with a 2.8-inch display with a pixel format of 640x480 was good for a resolution of 285.7 ppi. <em>Thanks Eric!</em></p>

<p>* Let me know if you know of any smartphones with a higher resolution.</p>
