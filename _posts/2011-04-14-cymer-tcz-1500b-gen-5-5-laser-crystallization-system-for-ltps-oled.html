<p><a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=61073&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1550376">Cymer</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cymer, Inc., announced today that TCZ, its display equipment product division, has received a volume order for the TCZ-1500B, TCZ&acirc;&euro;&trade;s new Gen 5.5 crystallization system, from a leading Asian flat panel display (FPD) manufacturer.  This represents TCZ&acirc;&euro;&trade;s second volume order in 2011 and fourth tool customer.  The TCZ-1500B system is used for the production of advanced liquid crystal display (LCD) and next-generation organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays that are targeted for applications such as high-end smart phones and tablet computers.</p>
<p>Enabled by Cymer industry-leading light source technology, the TCZ-1500B incorporates a high-power laser for increased throughput, and the Gen 5.5 system allows for a three-time increase in substrate size compared to Gen 4 systems, reducing manufacturing costs for display makers.</blockquote></p>
<p>Although the press release does not state who the customer is, if the TCZ-1500B laser crystallization system is used for the production of OLED displays, then the likely candidate is Samsung. The company currently building a Gen 5.5 OLED line slated to commence production in July. Just a hunch is all. Expect lots of OLED smartphones (and tablets?) later this year.</p>
