<p>The Unreal Engine 3 powers games like BioShock, Gears of War, Mass Effect, etc. and now it runs on the iPhone 3GS (iPod touch too). <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzts8tsKuHs&amp;feature=player_embedded">Watch the demo on YouTube</a>. Epic makes use of OpenGL ES 2.0 and plans to license the engine in the near future. Does hat means near-certain death to the DS and PSP? Sooner or later Apple will be touting 100,000 games on the App Store. And when that happens I don't think the DS or PSP has much of a chance. The next generation iPhone and the iPod touch will have a good chance of becoming the ultimate portable device that you must take everywhere you go for almost anything you want to do.
