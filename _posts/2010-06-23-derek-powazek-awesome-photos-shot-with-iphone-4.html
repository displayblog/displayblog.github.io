<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-11230 aligncenter" title="Derek_Powazek_iPhone_4_Photo_Leaf_Portion" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Derek_Powazek_iPhone_4_Photo_Leaf_Portion.jpg" alt="" width="511" height="493" /></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A small cropped portion of Powazek's <a href="http://powazek.com/posts/2503">photo of a leaf</a>. Here's what he had to say about the quality of the iPhone 4's camera:</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">The iPhone 4 is the first decent cellphone camera I've ever owned. I'm just stunned by the image quality.</p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This isn't the final or definite word on picture quality coming out of the iPhone 4, but I get the feeling that for most of us we can leave our compact digital cameras at home. And for some of us we can start preparing to post our compact digital cameras on eBay or Craigslist.</p></p>
