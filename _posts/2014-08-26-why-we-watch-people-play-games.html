<p>Rich McCormick, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/8/26/6068993/this-is-why-people-want-to-watch-other-people-play-video-games">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&acirc;&euro;&trade;s no easy answer, but the most popular streamers offer viewers one or more of three key benefits: buying advice, a community built around a streamer's personality, or the chance to observe professional grade skill. These elements, coupled with Twitch&acirc;&euro;&trade;s ease of access and gamer-friendly attitude, have contributed to both the company&acirc;&euro;&trade;s billion dollar valuation, and a huge change in the way millions of people play and think about video games.</blockquote></p>
<p>When we watch people play games we want to experience a drama unfold where their personalities combined with their skills lead to glorious victories.</p>
