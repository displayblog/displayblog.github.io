<blockquote><p>All images are Photoshopped. Or Lightroomed, or iPhoto'd, or dodged, burned, re-touched, cross-processed, developed with more or less agitation in the tank, at warmer or cooler temperatures, and so on and so forth. This has been true since the beginning of photography.</blockquote></p>
<p>I agree, but where many disagree is how much manipulation should be accepted.</p>
