<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/27/lg-optimus-7-pops-up-on-amazon-de-with-5-megapixel-camera-3-5-i/">phoneseven.de</a>: The LG Optimus 7 is a new smartphone for Windows Phone 7. Hence the 7 I guess. The Optimus 7 sports a 3.8-inch LCD with a 800x480 pixel format powered by a 1GHz Snapdragon CPU. Also on board is a 5 megapixel camera and 16GB of built-in storage.</p>
<p>Two interesting features: speech-to-text and automatic panorama. I'm not sure that speech-to-text is going to be used all that much if LG is planning to sell the Optimus 7 in Korea. While you're in any form of public transportation the most annoying folks are those who are yapping on their phones. And that's why most text instead; texting is cheaper too. The automatic panorama, probably identical to Sony's Sweep Panorama, would be cool to have. The Optimus 7 is slated for an October 11 launch.</p>
<p>In related news the LG Optimus 7 is already available for sale on Amazon.de, but there it states the Optimus 7 as having just a 3.5-inch display. Including VAT the slightly smaller Optimus 7 is going for &acirc;&sbquo;&not;499.00 with free shipping.</p>
