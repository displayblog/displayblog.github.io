<p><a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/04/07/business/gods-edging-out-robots-at-toyota-facility/">Craig Trudell, Yuki Hagiwara, and Ma Jie, The Japan Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;We need to become more solid and get back to basics, to sharpen our manual skills and further develop them,&acirc;&euro; said Kawai, a half century-long company veteran tapped by President Akio Toyoda to promote craftsmanship at Toyota&acirc;&euro;&trade;s plants.</blockquote></p>
<p>An eminently logical move: monozukuri (the art of making things) leads to kaizen (continuous improvement).</p>
<blockquote><p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;We cannot simply depend on the machines that only repeat the same task over and over again,&acirc;&euro; Kawai said. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;To be the master of the machine, you have to have the knowledge and the skills to teach the machine.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>In addition to high quality automobiles I hope Toyota exports its monozukuri culture.</p>
