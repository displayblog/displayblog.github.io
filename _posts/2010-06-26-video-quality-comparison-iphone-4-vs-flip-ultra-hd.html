<p>Jeremy Horwitz, Editor-in-Chief at iLounge, compared the iPhone 4's video quality to the Flip Ultra HD:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the first time, iPhone 4 has the resolution to compete pixel for pixel against Flip&acirc;&euro;&trade;s higher-end recorder, and it has something Flip doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t: Tap to Focus during video, enabling the iPhone 4 to create depth of field effects, but also to render some scenes softly relative to the Flip since the latter device&acirc;&euro;&trade;s fixed-focus lens offers consistent sharpness without depth of field capabilities.</blockquote><br />
Hop on over to <a href="http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/news/comments/iphone-4-3gs-and-flip-ultra-hd-comparison-videos-posted">iLounge</a> for the videos. I don't know what it is but watching the 720p video captured with the iPhone 4 feels weird on my 17-inch MBP. I think maybe my display isn't up to the task with slow liquid crystal response times or it might be the 30fps. If I were to guess it's the 30fps. With this type of video capturing capability on the iPhone 4 the only type of video that would look good is slow panning. Ditto for the Flip Ultra HD. I think 720p video really needs 60fps for keeping up with moving objects or moving from object to object.</p>
