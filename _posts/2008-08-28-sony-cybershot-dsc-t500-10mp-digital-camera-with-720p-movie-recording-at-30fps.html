<p>On August 28, 2008, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sony">Sony</a> introduced its Cybershot DSC-T500 compact digital camera. The DSC-T500 sports a 10MP image sensor, is very compact, sports a high-tech look and seems to have a solid build. I often carry around my <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=canon">Canon</a> SD1000 to not only shoot pictures, but also video.

The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=640-x-480">640 x 480</a> video that it saves is good-enough for watching on the computer and for YouTube.

<p>The DSC-T500 can record 720p video at 30 frames per second (fps). <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=720p">720p</a> would be <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1280-x-720">1280 x 720</a> in terms of the pixel format. 30fps would be good enough to show on a 720p-capable LCD TV without much flicker. The video is encoded via the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=mpeg4">MPEG4</a> AVC/<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=h.264">H.264</a> codec and according to Sony results in very high-quality video and a small size. Perfect for what I need. But there are some catches. There is a 10 minute limit for video clips and memory expansion is via Sony's proprietary Memory Stick. I wonder if the DSC-T500 can take SD cards...</p>
<p>Images and video are fed through a Carl Zeiss 5x optical zoom lens with a 35mm equivalent 33 - 16mm. Sony's Optical SteadyShot image stabilization is there to help keep blurring to a minimum. While there are ISO sensitivities up to 3200, I would assume you would want to limit the ISO to about 800. The lens isn't very fast at just f/3.5-4.4 but mated to the sensitive CCD image sensor, image stabilization and set to about ISO 800, my guess is you'll be able to take indoor pictures without using the flash.</p>
<p>The back of the DSC-T500 is completely filled with a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=3.5">3.5"</a> wide TFT LCD. The 3.5" display is of the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=transflective">transflective</a> variety that allows for easy viewing both indoors and outdoors. The transflective display is the result of adding reflective properties into an inherently transmissive LCD. The expansive LCD also is touch capable allowing you to finger through the navigation. I do hope Sony add some optical films to the LCD to minimize fingerprints since the LCD will be used as the primary and only viewfinder.</p>
<p>With an expected price of about $400, the DSC-T500 has the potential to be the only device I carry with me all the time to take both digital pictures as well as HD video.</p>
