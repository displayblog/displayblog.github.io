<blockquote><p>Maybe Apple went to the trouble of cramming iOS 6 into the 3GS <em>not</em> because it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s for sale now, but because it will continue to be for sale for another year. They can obviously produce them <em>very</em> cheaply by now. How low can they push that price?</blockquote></p>
<p>With a contract the iPhone 3GS is already free, and I don't see carriers giving money back to new two year subscribers. So if true, my guess is the iPhone 3GS will be unlocked and offered for US$149, priced as a low end iPod touch without the retina display, but with phone capabilities.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.07.20:</em> <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2012/07/20/as-iphone-3gs-approaches-200-and-below-it-becomes-a-viable/">&Atilde;&permil;lyse Betters, 9to5 Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This corresponds with the global market pattern that has developed over the past few months, where the iPhone 3GS is trending toward $200 <em>unsubsidized</em>.</blockquote></p>
<p>When the next iPhone (5) comes out I'd bet the price of an unlocked, unsubsidized iPhone 3GS will head toward $149, maybe even lower.</p>
