<p>Pam Belluck, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/15/health/fda-approves-technology-to-give-limited-vision-to-blind-people.html">The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The artificial retina is a sheet of electrodes implanted in the eye. The patient is also given glasses with an attached camera and a portable video processor. This system, called Argus II, allows visual signals to bypass the damaged portion of the retina and be transmitted to the brain.</blockquote></p>
<p>Argus II is made by <a href="http://2-sight.eu/ee/home-ee">Second Sight Medical Products</a>.</p>
