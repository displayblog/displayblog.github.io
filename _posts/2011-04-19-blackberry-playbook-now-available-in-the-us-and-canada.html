<blockquote><p>Never mind the reviews, if the PlayBook is on your shopping list, you probably don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t need a reminder that it hits a variety of retailers today in both the US and Canada. Pricing is much like the iPad&acirc;&euro;&trade;s with the 16 GB WiFi version starting out the party at $500, the 32GB costing $599, and the 64GB running $699. Of course the PlayBook is only available in WiFi models as of yet with the 3G models still on tap for a later release.</blockquote></p>
