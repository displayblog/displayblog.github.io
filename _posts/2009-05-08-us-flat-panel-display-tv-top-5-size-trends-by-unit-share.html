These guys experienced rapid growth and took the top spot in February and March. In March, Westinghouse Digital captured 29.3% share of 32" FPD TV unit sales.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=samsung&amp;sa=Search#1641">Samsung</a> was the #2 brand for 32" FPD TVs. Samsung's 32" FPD TV share has been steadily dropping since November but seems to have turned a corner in March. Samsung was the #1 brand for 32" FPD TVs in November and December.</p></p>

It did capture the top spot in October but now has fallen below <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=toshiba&amp;sa=Search#1583">Toshiba</a> in the 32" FPD TV category and sits at #4. Toshiba has been steadily increasing its share, overtook Sony in February and has taken the #3 spot in March. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=lg&amp;sa=Search#1537">LG</a> is a distant #5 but its 32" FPD TV market share has been quite steady and is slowly rising.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=sharp&amp;sa=Search#1572">Sharp</a> is missing from the top 5. Sharp has been quite popular with a 11.0% market share of 32" FPD TVs in October and has beaten LG four out of the last six months but in March fell below LG and so is outside of the top 5. Next is a detailed brand analysis in the 40" FPD TV segment.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-5988 aligncenter" title="displayblog_us_40_inch_fpd_tv_top_brands_oct_mar" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/displayblog_us_40_inch_fpd_tv_top_brands_oct_mar.jpg" alt="displayblog_us_40_inch_fpd_tv_top_brands_oct_mar" width="451" height="393" /></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There really are only three brands competing in the 40" FPD TV size segment in the US: Samsung, Toshiba and Sony, in that order. For 40" FPD TV segment, which is the second most popular size, Samsung unsurprisingly leads with a dominant 48.4% unit market share. Its unit market share has slowly declined since October but seems to have regained some strength in March.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Toshiba has been growing market share in the 40" FPD TV segment quite rapidly and overtook Sony in December. Sony is #3 and has steadily experienced a decline in its market share for 40" FPD TVs.</p></p>
