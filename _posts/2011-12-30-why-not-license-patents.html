<p><a href="http://brooksreview.net/2011/12/apple-patent-war/">Ben Brooks</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t know the why here, but if I had to guess I would say that Apple only wants users to have an iOS experience on an iOS device. And if that is the why, then licensing doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t solve a damned thing.</blockquote></p>
<p>I think Brooks is right. But that also means Microsoft doesn't care if there's bits and pieces of Windows Phone in Android, as long as it's getting paid.</p>
