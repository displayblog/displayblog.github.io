<p>The Walt Disney Company is entering the mobile space with a new service called Disney Mobile and introduced a new phone, LG's DM-L200. The phone is red, has a 1.3 megapixel camera (1280 x 960, 640 x 480 and 320 x 240) with flash and is targeted, you guessed it, at kids. You can also shoot video at 176 x 144 resolution (QCIF). If you're only talking, LG claims a talk-time of 4 hours but with games and such, probably much less. The DM-L200 has a speakerphone and Bluetooth (v1.1) as well. Could we expect Bluetooth headsets for kids? I want a Superman headset please!</p>

<p>The phone works on CDMA networks (Verizon), has 1xRTT data tranmission capability, and the main TFT LCD display has 128 x 160 resolution and can display 262,000 colors and 11 lines of text. The external display is a 94 x 64 resolution OLED display that has 65,000 color capability and 4 lines of text.</p>
<p>This is the first attempt and maybe that's why the phone looks so... normal. How about faceplates that can be replaced with some favorite Disney characters? Are there Mommy, Daddy and Emergency direct-connect buttons? At $60, maybe I'm expecting too much.</p>
