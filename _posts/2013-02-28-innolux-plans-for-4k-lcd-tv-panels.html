<blockquote><p>The president said Innolux has already begun cooperating with China-based TV vendors to release a number of Ultra HD TVs by the May 1 holidays in China, including 39-. 50-, 55-, 58- and 65-inch units. He also said Innolux aims to put out other sizes in the future as well including smaller sizes in an effort to popularize the products among consumers outside of those who can afford high-end TV products.</blockquote></p>
<p>Small, and affordable, 4K TVs are on the way.</p>
