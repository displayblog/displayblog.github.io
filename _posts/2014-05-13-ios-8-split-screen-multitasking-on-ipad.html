<p><a href="http://9to5mac.com/2014/05/13/apple-plans-to-match-microsoft-surface-with-split-screen-ipad-multitasking-in-ios-8/">Mark Gurman, 9to5Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>iOS 8 is likely to supercharge the functionality of Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s iPad with a new split-screen multitasking feature, according to sources with knowledge of the enhancement in development. These people say that the feature will allow iPad users to run and interact with two iPad applications at once.</blockquote></p>
<p>I don't know about you, but iOS 7 is complicated enough. I just made a video and uploaded to Vimeo (private, sorry) and I was asked this question, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;How can I save your video to my iPhone?&acirc;&euro;¬ù The answer is long. Google it if you don't know the answer. </p>
<p>iOS 7 is heavy too. My son uses an iPhone 4 with iOS 7. Let's just say the user experience is about 80% of the speed it should be.</p>
<p>Instead of adding more features, how about if Apple does what it did with Snow Leopard? Remember Snow Leopard? It was smaller than Leopard. It ran faster than Leopard. I think the hardware requirements were less than Leopard. Let's do that with iOS 8.</p>
<p>Instead of adding hundreds of new features, making it bigger, heavier, and more complicated how about we make the features that it already has easier to use so more people can use it? How about making it smaller and lighter so people with older hardware can have the same fast user experience?</p>
<p>Split-screen multitasking capability would help with my productivity. On my 17-inch MacBook Pro with 1920x1200 pixels, with the help of BetterTouchTool, I make use of two 960x1200 windows side by side. The source material is on the left and the writing window is on the right. I'm pretty productive with this setup, but this works for me because I can actually see the fonts.</p>
<p>I've tried this on the newer retina 15-inch MacBook Pro's and the fonts are too small for me. Imagine how tiny the fonts will be if you wanted full-sized documents &mdash; two of them &mdash; on a 9.7-inch iPad? Nope, ain't gonna work. The fonts will be big enough when Apple develops a 15.7-inch iPad with a 4096x3072 (4:3 aspect ratio) pixel format, which by the way sports a resolution of 326 ppi.</p>
