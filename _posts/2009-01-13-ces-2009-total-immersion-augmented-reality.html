<p>During CES 2009, I met up wih Greg Davis, General Manager of <a href="http://www.t-immersion.com/">Total Immersion</a> to get an update after I spoke with CEO Bruno Uzzan several months ago during NVIDIA's VISION conference in San Jose. Total Immersion is a software solutions provider that uses a technology called "Augmented Reality" that integrates <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=3d">3D</a> objects into live video. When I first read that description I had no clue and needed to actually see it. When Bruno gave me a demo at a Starbucks near the San Jose Convention Center I was blown away. Click on the video above and check out what augmented reality is and you'll see that Total Immersion is up to something quite interesting.</p>
