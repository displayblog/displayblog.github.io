<p><em>Plus</em>. What's next? Super? Anyway, the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus has a pixel format of 1920x1080. Finally, an industry standard pixel format. The resolution is 401 pixels per inch.</p>
<p>Still the iPhone 6 Plus is quite a ways behind when it comes to the display. The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/04/22/lg-g3/">LG G3</a> and the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/09/03/samsung-galaxy-note-4/">Samsung Galaxy Note 4</a> both sport 2560x1440 pixel formats, and their resolutions &mdash; 534 ppi and 515 ppi respectively &mdash; are significantly higher too.</p>
