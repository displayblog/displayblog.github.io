<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/joeholmes/sets/72157627036687802/with/5866202835/">26 photos of texters in New York City by Joseph Holmes</a>. He took the photos with a Nikon D700.</p>
<p>I could only identify the iPhone 4. And I was a bit alarmed when I saw a photo of a lady texting while crossing the street.</p>
