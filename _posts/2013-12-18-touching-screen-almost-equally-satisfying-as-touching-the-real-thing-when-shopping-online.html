<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/12/18/touch-shopping">John Gruber</a>. <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/12/18/online-shopping-touch-appears-beat-click/mVIj2jTbf2hwVr9PUnDPJL/story.html">Megan Woolhouse, The Boston Globe</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>New research out of Boston College indicates that consumers feel a deeper affinity for products they touch on a screen than those selected using a laptop touchpad or a mouse.</p>
<p>When consumers participating in the study reached out and touched an image on a touchscreen, the experience nearly rivaled their feelings of touching merchandise in a brick-and-mortar store, according to the measure of satisfaction used in the study.</blockquote></p>
<p>I expect interactive touching of high-quality photos of products for sale will be everywhere, and soon.</p>
