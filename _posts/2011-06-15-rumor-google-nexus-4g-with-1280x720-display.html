<p><a href="http://www.bgr.com/2011/06/15/exclusive-google-nexus-4g-detailed-720p-display-4g-lte-android-4-0/">BGR</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The display is said to be a 720p HD &acirc;&euro;&oelig;monster-sized&acirc;&euro;¬ù screen, and it won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t feature physical Android menu buttons below the screen anymore &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; everything will be software-based.</blockquote></p>
<p>The elimination of those four buttons might be the key to integrating a "monster-sized" display. My guess: a 4.5- to 4.7-inch LCD with a 1280x720 pixel format. At 4.5 inches the resolution is 326 ppi and at 4.7 inches the resolution drops to 312 ppi. If I were to choose between the two it would be a 4.5-inch, which would sport the exact ppi as the 3.5-inch Retina Display in the iPhone 4.</p>
<p>Videos captured in 720p HD will be perfectly displayed pixel-for-pixel. If this turns out to be true, then the Google Nexus 4G will be the only modern display where you can enjoy 720p HD video absolutely unscaled, and without wasting a single pixel.</p>
