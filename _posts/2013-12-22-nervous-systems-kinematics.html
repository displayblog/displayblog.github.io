<p><a href="http://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/blog/?p=4467">Nervous System</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Kinematics is a system for 4D printing that creates complex, foldable forms composed of articulated modules. The system provides a way to turn any three-dimensional shape into a flexible structure using 3D printing. Kinematics combines computational geometry techniques with rigid body physics and customization. Practically, Kinematics allows us to take large objects and compress them down for 3D printing through simulation. It also enables the production of intricately patterned wearables that conform flexibly to the body.</blockquote></p>
<p>In other words, Nervous System's Kinematics let you 3D print big flexible stuff. Check out <a href="http://vimeo.com/nervoussystem/kinematics">the Kinematics video</a>.</p>
