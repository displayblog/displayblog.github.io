<p><strong>WIRELESS TO TV:</strong> I'm not sure if the term WiDi (Why Die?) will catch on but Toshiba's Satellite E205 is the world's first notebook PC to have Wireless Display integrated. What is Wireless Display? It is an Intel technology that allows a wireless connection between a computing device, like the E205, to a TV via an HDMI adapter. The technology seems to be pretty neat since you won't need a wire to connect your notebook to your TV. I don't know too many people who would want to do that but with the growing number of folks who keep a lot of their movies on their computers this Wireless Display technology makes it really easy to watch them on a bigger TV. I wonder if Hulu works...</p>
<p><strong>$999.99 Core i5:</strong> The E205 is a 14-inch notebook PC sporting an Intel Core i5-430M CPU with Turbo Boost. Other specs include: LED backlit keyboard, slot-loading DVD drive, multitouch touchpad, 6-hour battery, WiFi N, Bluetooth 2.1, and a weight of 5.1 pounds going for a MSRP of US$999.99.
