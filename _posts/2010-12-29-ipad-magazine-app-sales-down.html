<blockquote><p>According to the magazine circulation-tracking Audit Bureau of Circulations, only 8,700 people bought an iPad issue of Vanity Fair in November, down from 10,500 in August. Glamour? Even worse, with only a paltry 2,775 iPad issues sold in October, compared to a slightly less paltry 4,301 in September. Dude stuff powerhouse GQ? Also in the dumps, with a worst-ever 11,000 downloads in November.</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple needs to establish in-app subscription services. Right now you have to download each magazine as a separate app. And these magazine apps are huge. Make it easy for magazines to make money and make it even easier for iPad owners to buy them, download them, and enjoy them.</p>
