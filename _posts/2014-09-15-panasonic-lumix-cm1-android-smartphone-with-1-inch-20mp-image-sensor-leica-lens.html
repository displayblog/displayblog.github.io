<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/15/6151671/panasonic-leica-cm1-android-cameraphone">The Verge</a>: I have a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2012/06/05/sony-dsc-rx100/">Sony RX100</a> and it takes great photos for a pocketable camera. I bought the RX100 because the photo quality coming out of my iPhone 5s wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t good enough. The RX100 sports a 20MP 1-inch Exmor CMOS image sensor mated to a Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T* f/1.8 lens.</p>
<p>The Panasonic CM1 also features a 20MP 1-inch image sensor, but the Leica lens is significantly slower at f/2.8. Even the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have faster f/2.2 lenses. The CM1 &mdash; unlike regular smartphones &mdash; has a mechanical shutter and a manual control ring, like the RX100. Like other smartphones, the CM1 has a display (4.7 inches and 1920x1080 pixels) and runs an operating system (Android 4.4).</p>
<p>I've long desired a smartphone like the CM1: a full-blown camera fused into a smartphone. I don't think the CM1 is that camera-smartphone hybrid of my dreams (that would be an iPhone 5s + RX100), but I think &mdash; like the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2013/07/11/nokia-lumia-1020/">Nokia Lumia 1020</a> &mdash; it's a glimpse of where smartphones are going, but without the huge bulge.</p>
