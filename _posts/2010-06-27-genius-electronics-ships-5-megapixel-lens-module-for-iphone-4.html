<p>Genius Electronics Optical, a Taiwan-based manufacturer of optical lens kits, has started shipping its 5 megapixel lens module for Apple's iPhone 4 according to <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20100628PD200.html">DIGITIMES</a>. Initial shipments are small due to low yield rates. Genius Electronics, what a name, is busy manufacturing and shipping 3 megapixel camera modules, which account for 40% of the company's total camera lens module shipments.</p>
<p>Earlier, <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20100611PD200.html">DIGITIMES</a> reported that Asia Optical commenced shipment of its 640x480 (VGA) lens kit for the iPhone 4's front camera in May 2010. In the beginning of June the company's shipment volume was around three million units.</p>
<p>Although I have never heard of these two companies it seems Apple has done a solid job of putting together its camera system on the iPhone 4. The quality of photographs and videos on the iPhone 4 is nothing short of spectacular, for smartphones (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/26/video-quality-comparison-iphone-4-vs-flip-ultra-hd/">Video Quality Comparison: iPhone 4 vs. Flip Ultra HD</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/25/macworld-iphone-4-sports-best-smartphone-camera/">MacWorld: iPhone 4 Sports Best Smartphone Camera</a></em>).</p>
