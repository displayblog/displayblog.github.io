<p><a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/computers-will-soon-make-us-irrelevant-apple-co-founder-warns-msu-graduates/">Steve Wozniak</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Every time we invent a computer to do something else, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s doing our work for us, making ourselves less relevant. The cyborgs are winning! The androids are winning! Artificial intelligence will in the future become more and more like a real person, like a friend you would want to go and meet. Somebody that can talk to your face; somebody that can understand things [and] knows the kind of jokes you like; [somebody] that knows what sort of things to say depending on how slowly you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re talking then; a real person.</p>
<p>One of the things is, you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve got to have human senses. How does a computer ever create art, for example, if it can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t sense things that a human understands, like the wind on a beach. Well, our computers have gotten hearing and seeing, they&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve got feeling, touch sensitive; they can sense motion, just like our inner ear. Pretty soon we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re going to have holograms, which are much better than what you call 3D television. We&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve created a new species; no question. We&acirc;&euro;&trade;re creators and, like I said, we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re making ourselves less relevant.</blockquote></p>
<p>I must humbly disagree. With the development of these cyborgs we humans become more relevant. We need more engineers, not less, to continue developing cyborgs. If current operating systems and software applications are any indication there will be a lot of work getting rid of bugs. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field that requires an understanding of software, hardware, and how our own body works. And how about hardware? My goodness. We'll need mechanical engineers, material science engineers, folks with robotics experience, etc. Then you'll need managers that can bring all of these people together to work. I'm pretty sure we'll be more relevant, but just up until cyborgs decide they'd like to use us as a source of energy. Wozniak ended his speech with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Happiness equals food, friends, and fun.</blockquote></p>
<p>I'll drink to that!</p>
