<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Apple_iPhone_South_Korea_Sausage_Stylus.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9598 aligncenter" style="margin-left: 10px;" title="Apple_iPhone_South_Korea_Sausage_Stylus" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Apple_iPhone_South_Korea_Sausage_Stylus.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>This is hilarious! There's a "Mini Sausage Max Bong" snack in South Korea that is being used as a stylus for the iPhone. The closest thing here in the US would be those cheese sticks, at least I think that's what they are called.

<p>Because the iPhone uses capacitive touch technology it is impossible to use it when you have normal gloves on. It gets really cold during the winter in South Korea, so iPhone users are using these sausages (still in the plastic wrapper, of course) to work the iPhone.
