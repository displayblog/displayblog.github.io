<blockquote><p>Until now, all AMOLED displays have been made with polysilicon backplanes, a higher-cost material. However amorphous silicon is an attractive material for AMOLED since it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s used to make most of the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s LCD displays. Compared to polysilicon it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s highly uniform, less expensive, and represents 95% of the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s manufacturing capacity for displays.</p>
<p>It was previously thought that amorphous silicon backplanes were unsuitable for OLED due to stability problems; however IGNIS technology has solved the stability problems, paving the way for this first product.</blockquote></p>
<p>The IGNIS Innovation 3.47-inch 480x320 AMOLED display is the world's first AMOLED display that makes use of an a-Si backplane. IGNIS will be showcasing its AMOLED display during SID 2011.</p>
