<blockquote><p>The Xoom has a 10.1-inch screen (measuring 8.5 by 5.25 inches), and it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s as bright and sharp as any other high-end tablet. We did notice a slightly discolored band running down the edge of the screen on one side, but since we can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t compare it to other Xooms yet, we don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t know if this is a problem with our review unit or a more general manufacturing defect.</blockquote></p>
<p>A discolored band running down the edge of the display? That sounds like a driver IC problem. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/02/24/motorola-xoom-review-by-andy-ihnatko/">Andy Ihnatko had problems with color</a>. Maybe the early batch of Motorola Xooms have a display quality control problem.</p>
