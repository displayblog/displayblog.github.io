<blockquote><p>Should a U.S. Googler pass away while under the employ of the 14-year old search giant, their surviving spouse or domestic partner will receive a check for 50% of their salary every year for the next decade. Even more surprising, a Google spokesperson confirms that there&acirc;&euro;&trade;s &acirc;&euro;&oelig;no tenure requirement&acirc;&euro;¬ù for this benefit [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>Assuming a Googler makes US$100,000 per year, this death benefit amounts to $50,000 per year for a total of $500,000 in 10 years, without costing anything to the Googler. This is a wonderful benefit.</p>
