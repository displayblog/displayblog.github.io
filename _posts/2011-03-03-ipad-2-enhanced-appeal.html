<p>Oppenheimer analyst Yair Reiner <em>via</em> <a href="http://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/Analysts-laud-Apple-iPad-2-rsg-828837696.html?x=0&.v=2">Yahoo!</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>While it doesn't include any new breakthrough features or functionalities, the sum total of its refinements and upgrades - thinner, lighter, faster, more connected - significantly enhance the device's overall appeal.</blockquote></p>
<p>I see no other company able to cram everything Apple has into a 1.3-pound, 8.8-mm thick 9.7-inch aluminum block of a tablet. Now <em>that</em> is a breakthrough feature.</p>
