<blockquote><p>Because as fun as it is to share iPhone photos conveniently on Instagram, that can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be my only photography: I also need some photos that won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t look like shit when I look back on them in the future.</blockquote></p>
<p>Image sensors, especially full frame ones, have gotten so good limitations of the lenses become pronounced. Likewise, the retina display on the new MacBook Pro has gotten so good photos taken by Apple's finest photography tool look terrible on it. I'm looking forward to what Apple does with the camera sub-system in the new iPhone (5).</p>
