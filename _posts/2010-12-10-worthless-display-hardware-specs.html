<p>Dr. Raymond Soneira, President of <a href="http://www.displaymate.com/db">DisplayMate Technologies</a>, on <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5669331/why-most-hardware-specs-are-total-bullshit">Gizmodo</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The problem here, according to Soneira, is that most picture transitions involve much smaller, more subtle shades of gray-to-gray transitions, which usually take much longer (3-4 x) to complete. Those response times are far more important to a display's ability to handle motion blur. But consumers often have no way of knowing which response time is being measured (gray-to-gray or rise-and-fall).</blockquote></p>
<p>When you're researching LCD TVs make sure response times are measuring gray-to-gray or GTG. With plasmas you don't have to worry about response times because they're more than fast enough.</p>
