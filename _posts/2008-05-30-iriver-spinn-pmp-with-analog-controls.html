<p><a href="http://crave.cnet.co.uk/digitalmusic/0,39029432,49297149,00.htm">Crave</a>: iriver's Spinn is a very nice looking portable multimedia player (PMP). The fact that it has analog controls is, for some reason, very tempting. I like the idea of digital superbly intertwined with analog. The digital portion is brought to you by Active Matrix Organic Light Emitting Diode (AMOLED) display technology. The 3.2" AMOLED screen should pop your eyes out. I am truly amazed at how beautiful some OLED screens look. I'm sure the one in iriver's Spinn will not disappoint.</p>
