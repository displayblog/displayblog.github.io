<p>Jacob Kastrenakes, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/8/29/6084171/cable-companies-file-to-stop-municipal-broadband-expansion">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A group representing giants in the cable industry is trying to shut down two municipalities&acirc;&euro;&trade; proposals to expand their public broadband networks, arguing that public broadband has a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;mixed record&acirc;&euro;¬ù and can be harmful to taxpayers, despite these two networks already being successful where they're already operational.</blockquote></p>
<p>USTelecom, United States Telecom Association, represents Comcast, Time Warner Cable, and other large companies.</p>
<p>Dominic Rushe, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/29/us-telecoms-fcc-block-high-speed-internet-chattanooga">The Guardian</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Chattanooga has the largest high-speed internet service in the US, offering customers access to speeds of 1 gigabit per second &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; about 50 times faster than the US average. The service, provided by municipally owned EPB, has sparked a tech boom in the city and attracted international attention. EPB is now petitioning the FCC to expand its territory. Comcast and others have previously sued unsuccessfully to stop EPB&acirc;&euro;&trade;s fibre optic roll out.</blockquote></p>
<p>I live in Silicon Valley, San Jose to be specific. I have two choices when it comes to broadband connectivity: AT&T U-verse and Comcast. I go back and forth between the two based on speed, price, and reliability. AT&T U-verse has better reliability: I can rely upon it to provide the broadband speed I paid for. But what I pay for is expensive; right now I can get 45Mbps for US$65 per month. Comcast has better deals: $40 per month for 50Mbps, but what you actually get is much less. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/08/28/comcast-coerce-netflix-netflix-lose-customers/">Yesterday I ran Speedtest and got 5.64Mbps</a>. Today, at 5:08pm, I got 8.00Mbps, about 1/6th the speed I pay for. One is way too expensive, the other is supposedly fast and cheap for the supposed speed, but is actually as fast as molasses. This is broadband in Silicon Valley, in 2014.</p>
<p>What would I do if the city of San Jose decided to roll out fiber and offer me 1Gbps &mdash; that's 1024Mbps &mdash; broadband? For $70? I'd get it. Not only because it's a great deal, but because the alternative deals from AT&T U-verse and Comcast suck.</p>
