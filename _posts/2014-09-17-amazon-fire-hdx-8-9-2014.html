<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HCNHDN0/">Amazon</a>: The Fire HDX 8.9 sports an 8.9-inch LCD with a pixel format of 2560x1600 and a resolution of 339 ppi. By the way, those specs are better than those of the retina iPad mini. No, specs are not everything but when you consider the starting price of US$379 with 16GB of storage, and one year of Prime worth $99, the value proposition cannot be easily dismissed. One more feature to consider: Mayday, which is a free service that connects you to a live customer support person 24x7x365.</p>
