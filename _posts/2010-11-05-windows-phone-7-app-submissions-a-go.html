<blockquote><p>As of today, the Windows Phone 7 app submission process on App Hub is now open to all registered Windows Phone Marketplace developers. Please take full advantage of your Marketplace developer account by submitting your Windows Phone 7 apps or games to the Marketplace now.</blockquote></p>
