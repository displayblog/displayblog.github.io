<blockquote><p>Lashinsky explained his biggest takeaway from writing the book: &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Apple, the second most valuable company the world, does business exactly the opposite way that business is taught in business schools&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s in many ways the antithesis of the image that we have of google with its bean bag chairs.&acirc;&euro;¬ù</blockquote></p>
<p>Adam Lashinsky is author of <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/inside-apple/id444015286?mt=11&partnerId=30&siteID=lbdpb9V9bvo"><em>Inside Apple: How America's Most Admired&mdash;and Secretive&mdash;Company Really Works</em></a> (iTunes affiliate link).</p>
