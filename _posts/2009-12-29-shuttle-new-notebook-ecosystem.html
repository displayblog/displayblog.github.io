<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20091229PD213.html">DigiTimes</a>: On December 29, 2009 Shuttle announced the formation of the New Notebook Ecosystem (NNE) alliance, which aims to integrate supply chain resources and offer two series of notebooks. The two are the standard PCB assembly (SPA) and the micro-SPA series. In 2010 the NNE alliance plans to announce notebooks designs that support seven different display sizes. There will be challenges: negotiating joint procurement. In my opinion, most of these alliances fail due to the complexities of administering them; the better option is to purchase a smaller notebook manufacturer to gain leverage in procuring components, reduce costs and increase value by offering what early adopters want and will pay extra for.</p>
