<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=innolux">Innolux</a> Display expects LCD monitor shipments to increase 20% in January 2009. In November, global inventory for LCD monitors were about 4.5 million units. In December that number is expected to drop to about 2.5 million units and to a tight 100,000 to 200,000 units in January 2009. This is interesting news because the first half of each calendar year is usually very weak when it comes to IT goods such as monitors.</p>
<p>Innolux expects to ship 32 million LCD monitors in 2008, a slight decrease from what the company originally planned at 33 million units. In other news, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=foxconn">Foxconn</a> Electronics, the branded name for <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=hon-hai">Hon Hai</a> Precision Industry, entered the notebook OEM business in August 2008 and expects to ship 3 million LCD panels geared for notebook PCs in 2009. Innolux Display is owned by Hon Hai would be one of the primary sources for LCDs.</p>
