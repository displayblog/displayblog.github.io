<p><a href="http://global.samsungtomorrow.com/the-safety-truck-could-revolutionize-road-safety/">Samsung Tomorrow</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Safety Truck consists of a wireless camera attached to the front of the truck, which is connected to a video wall made out of four exterior monitors located on the back of the truck. The monitors give drivers behind the truck a view of what is going on ahead, even in the dark of night.</blockquote></p>
<p>Driving behind a slow big rig is not fun; overtaking it &mdash; especially on a single lane &mdash; is really not fun.</p>
<p>This Safety Truck idea by Samsung is pretty cool, but I don't know that I would overtake it if I happened to come up to one. I might stay behind and just watch.</p>
