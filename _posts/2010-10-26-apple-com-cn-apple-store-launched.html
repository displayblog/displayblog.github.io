<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/10/26chinaonlinestore.html">Apple</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s online store in China features free shipping, free personalized engraving on any iPod&Acirc;&reg; or iPad, and the ability to custom configure any Mac&Acirc;&reg; with just a few clicks. The online Apple Store also offers a wide selection of third-party products and is the only place online to buy the iPod nano&Acirc;&reg; (PRODUCT) RED.</blockquote></p>
<p>That's not all: Apple's App Store is now in Simplified Chinese.</p>
