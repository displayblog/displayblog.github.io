<p><a href="http://frankchimero.com/what-screens-want/">Frank Chimero</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the reasons that I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m so fascinated by screens is because their story is our story. First there was darkness, and then there was light. And then we figured out how to make that light dance. Both stories are about transformations, about change. Screens have flux, and so do we.</blockquote></p>
