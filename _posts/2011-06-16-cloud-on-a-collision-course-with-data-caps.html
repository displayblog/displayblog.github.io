<p><a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/16/excited-about-the-cloud-get-ready-for-capped-data-plans/">David Pogue</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not the worst mega-trend. The worst is caps on home data plans. That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s right: Time Warner, Comcast and other broadband providers are putting limits on how much data you get every month, even at home.</p>
<p>And that, my friends, is one crazy scary development. How are we supposed to enjoy our cloud if we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re allowed only selective access to it? How is the bold new world of online computing going to take off if the meter is racking up punishing overage charges every time we look at our photos?</blockquote></p>
