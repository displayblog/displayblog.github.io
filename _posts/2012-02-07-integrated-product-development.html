<blockquote><p>The whole basis of the class I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve taught at UVM for 21 years is &acirc;&euro;&brvbar; integrated product development, which means concurrently looking at all of these things: the aesthetics, the engineering, the marketing &acirc;&euro;&brvbar; which is what we were doing at Apple. Not necessarily purposefully, but everybody was just thrown together&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; I would walk through the software place and look around and see what people were doing &acirc;&euro;&brvbar; walk through the marketing area. I had my drawings all on the walls, so anybody could come up. There was a red pencil hanging there. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d say, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;If you see something you don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t like, or is a problem &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t care whether it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a janitor or Steve &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; write the correction, circle it, put your phone there and I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll call you and we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll talk about it.&acirc;&euro;¬ù</blockquote></p>
<p>The difference is back then integrated product development just happened, now it is purposefully happening. And about Manock's drawings on the wall and the red pencil: I think Steve's style was to correct verbally right then and there.</p>
