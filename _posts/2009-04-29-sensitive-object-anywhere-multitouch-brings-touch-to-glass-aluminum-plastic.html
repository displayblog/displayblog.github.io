  a good platform to develop a touch keyboard made of plastic. Some cool videos after
  the jump. "

Some cool videos after the jump. <a id="more"></a><a id="more-5793"></a><strong>Table Remote</strong> Sensitive Object's touch technology was incorporated into a table. The video shows a user just touching lighted portions of a table to control the TV. That's a cool idea!</p>

<p><strong>Touch Dashboard</strong> Your car dashboard can now be made touch sensitive. The calibration is quick and simple. There is one caveat: any design in a car will require some careful thought. The driver needs to have his eyes on the road and still be able to, with a quick glance, touch the controls on the dash. This is not easy to accomplish.</p>

<p><strong>Touch Everything </strong>A mirror is endowed with touch sensitivity that allows control over lighting, curtains, etc. There is another implementation of the table remote. The wall is made touch sensitive too. Tap it and the lights turn on. Double-tap the kitchen counter and the embedded display turns on! Nifty. Shower stall? Music controls are on the glass itself--inside and out. And it is waterproof. How cool is that!</p>
