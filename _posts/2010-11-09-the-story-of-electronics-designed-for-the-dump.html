<p><a href="http://gizmodo.com/5685911/the-dirty-toxic-secret-behind-our-disposable-gadgets">Gizmodo</a>: The main thesis is that today's electronics are designed for the dump:</p>
<p>EXTRACTION &rarr; PRODUCTION &rarr; DISTRIBUTION &rarr; CONSUMPTION &rarr; DISPOSAL</p>
<blockquote><p>Designed for the dump sounds crazy, right? But when you're trying to sell lots of stuff it makes perfect sense. It's a key strategy of the companies that make our electronics. In fact it's a key part of our unsustainable materials economy. Designed for the dump means making stuff to be thrown away quickly.</blockquote></p>
<p>25 million tons of e-waste is created every year. This connects well with the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/11/09/ifixit-self-repair-manifesto/"><em>iFixit Self-Repair Manifesto</em></a>. The way I try to help is to purchase products with high quality that will last a long time.</p>
