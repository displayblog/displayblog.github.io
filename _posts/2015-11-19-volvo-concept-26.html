<p>[ <a href="https://www.futureofdriving.com/concept26.html">Volvo</a> ] The Concept 26 is Volvo's vision of the future of cars where autonomous self-driving technology is combined with our need for control. I think it is an exceptionally well balanced vision. The three modes -- drive, create, relax -- gives control to the driver. Drive lets the driver take the wheel. Create gives the driver a little more room by sliding back the seat and tilting. In Relax mode the seat is fully reclined. Create and Relax put the car in autonomous mode, but the driver can at any time re-engage Drive and take control.</p>
