<p><a href="http://www.electronista.com/articles/08/12/09/dell.ultrasharp.1909w/">Electronista</a> <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/12/10/dells-ultrasharp-1909w-does-an-awkward-barrel-roll-into-the-rea/">Engadget</a>: The Dell UltraSharp 1909W is a 19" wide LCD monitor with a pixel format of 1440x900. The TN LCD panel leads to a fast response time of 5ms but with viewing angles at just 160/160. This is not a problem if you'll be looking at the monitor dead on. However if you require color fidelity at off angles, look for LCD monitors that sport either PVA or IPS LCD panels. The 1909W is a LCD monitor geared for business. There is no HDMI port just good 'ol DVI and VGA. But for good measure, the folks at Dell added HDCP to the DVI port so you can watch protected HD content on the 19 incher. Like other UltraSharp-branded LCD monitors, the 1909W comes with four USB 2.0 ports and allows for tilt, pivot, swivel and height adjustments.</p>
