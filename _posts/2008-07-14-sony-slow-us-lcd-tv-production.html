<p>On July 10, 2008, Sony confirmed that it has temporarily reduced US-based <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a> production. Sony's Mount Pleasant, Pa., LCD television plant manufactures <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=46"">46"</a> and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=52"">52"</a> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a>s and because of reduced demand for 52" LCD TVs, Sony has decided to reduce production at this plant. </p>
<p>The Mount Pleasant LCD TV production facility operates three production lines. The lines run 10 hours each day for four days a week. The reduction involves a night shift reduction from three to two lines. The four day workweek has been reduced to just three.</p>
<p>This should come as no surprise to anyone since it has been <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/04/16/lcd-tv-consumers-shifting-to-smaller-affordable-models-according-to-pacific-media-associates/">reported that consumers are purchasing smaller and more affordable LCD TVs</a>. There are also inventory that is building up in the supply chain including LCD panels, finished goods at integrators in Taiwan and China as well as at retailers in the US.</p>
