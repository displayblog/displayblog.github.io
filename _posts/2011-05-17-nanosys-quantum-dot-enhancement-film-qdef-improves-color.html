<p><a href="http://www.nanosysinc.com/in_the_news/nanosys-unlocks-full-color-lcd-viewing-experience-with-nanotechnology-announcing-qdef/">Nanosys</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nanosys, Inc., an advanced materials architect, today announced that its next generation LCD technology, the Quantum Dot Enhancement Film (QDEF), is available to display manufacturers. Device designers can now increase color gamut by as much as 3x without making the trade offs in cost, size and brightness they&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve had to make in the past. This means richer, more viscerally vibrant reds and a deeper palette of greens &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; the color the human eye sees more intensely than any other color.</blockquote></p>
<p>According to Nanosys most displays are limited to 20 to 35% of the colors that we can see. QDEF-based displays will increase that to 60%. The quantum dot material generates better quality white light using an energy-efficient blue LED.</p>
