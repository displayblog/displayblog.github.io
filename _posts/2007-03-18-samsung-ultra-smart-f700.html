<p>Samsung is upping the stakes for smartphones with its Ultra Smart F700. The F700 follows the simple style of Apple's iPhone, when closed. The F700 sports a 2.78" LCD touch display with a pixel format of 240 x 440 in portrait mode (440 x 240 in landscape, as in the picture). Now, unlike the iPhone, the F700 has a full QWERTY keyboard when you slide it out. The picture, it seems, is just a mock up as the backspace and the return key is one single key. The smartphone plays audio and video with these formats supported:</p>

<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/03/16/hands-on-with-samsungs-slick-sliding-glory-the-f700/">Engadget</a> scored some pictures during CeBIT of the F700 smartphone and really liked the design. A reflective glossy chrome material is used on the back that brings a real classy look. On the technology side, the F700 sports 900/1800/1900MHz GSM, EDGE and 7.2Mbps HSDPA. With the 2.78" wide screen video viewing will likely be one of the many things that the user can enjoy. Video support includes MPEG4, H.263 and H.264. Cool.</p>

<p>As you can see from this picture (Source: Engadget), the backspace and return keys are separate and different from the previous drawing. I am not sure if I like the location of the shift key. I really do hope the F700 comes to the US and give some competition to the iPhone. Because if it doesn't, I will most likely get an iPhone. I foresee a market for durable finger condoms. To relieve finger stress from using the iPhone too much, of course.</p>
