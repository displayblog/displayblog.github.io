<p>Next-generation automotive dashboards will be as technologically advanced as a netbook. Just look at the Lexus LFA's high-tech display and you'll get a very good idea of where dashboards of future cars are headed. During CES 2010 there were demonstrations of next-gen dashboards incorporating some advanced computing technologies such as NVIDIA's Tegra 2 GPU, Moblin, Intel's Atom CPU, etc. I'm all for incorporating advanced technology into autos but are we <em>really</em> ready to endure dashboard BSODs and reboots? My preference: round analog gauges. Source: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/14/next-gen-dashboards-get-tegra-2-moblin-atom-we-go-hands-on/">Engadget</a></p>
