<p><a href="http://jilion.com/sublime/video">Jilion</a>: Like the name the video is sublime. The video didn't stutter once, even at full screen (1920 x 1200) and during resizing. And all of this without a browser plugin or Flash. Only works on Safari (v4.0.4+), Google Chrome (v4.0+), and IE with Chrome Frame installed with Firefox support to come. I have seen the future of the web without Flash: it is beautiful.</p>
