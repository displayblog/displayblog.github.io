<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=au-optronics">AU Optronics</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=auo">AUO</a>) is the largest <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-manufacturer">LCD manufacturer</a> in Taiwan and ranks in the top three with two others: <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lg-display">LG Display</a> and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=samsung">Samsung</a>. AUO disclosed that the company will be constructing a 11G TFT LCD fabrication plant in 2H'09. Volume production is expected to commence in 2011 or 2012. The glass substrate size has not been determined but the fab will be located at the Erlin campus in the Central Taiwan Science Park (CSTP). In the next 10 years, AUO plans to build four LCD fabs that are G10 or larger at the Erlin location. AUO is skipping G10, the size that <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sharp">Sharp</a> is currently constructing and is expected to come online in April 2009. The average size of LCD TVs will certainly grow over the next few years thanks to Sharp, AUO and others.</p>
