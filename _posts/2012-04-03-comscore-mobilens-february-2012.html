<p>U.S. smartphone platform market share comparing the three month average ending February 2012 versus the three month average ending November 2011 according to <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2012/4/comScore_Reports_February_2012_U.S._Mobile_Subscriber_Market_Share">comScore</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google: 46.9% &rarr; 50.1%, +3.2% points</li>
<li>Apple: 28.7% &rarr; 30.2%, +1.5</li>
<li>RIM: 16.6% &rarr; 13.4%, -3.2</li>
<li>Microsoft: 5.2% &rarr; 3.9%, -1.3</li>
<li>Symbian: 1.5% &rarr; 1.5%, 0.0</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Despite all the efforts by Microsoft its share of the U.S. smartphone market keeps falling. Short of giving away Nokia Lumia smartphones I don't see how Microsoft will gain share. Unfortunately, I expect rapid market share losses to continue at RIM.</p>
