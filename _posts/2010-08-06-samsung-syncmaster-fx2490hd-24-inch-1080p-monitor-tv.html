<p>Samsung's SyncMaster FX2490HD is a 24-inch LCD monitor sporting an edge-lit LED backlight. The FX2490HD features a 1920x1080 pixel format, an integrated TV tuner, two HDMI ports, D-Sub and SCART. Other display specs include: 1000:1 contrast ratio, 250 cd/m2 brightness, a USB port. Priced around US$540 and should be available in September. </p>
<p>The stand. Some might like it but I just can't muster up enough like. The matte display looks wonderful to my eyes but the bezels seem to be unnecessarily thick thanks to the useless transparent design sticking out.</p>
<p>Thanks to the integrated TV tuner the FX2490HD can be used as a LCD TV as well. But I think it is unnecessary. I am fairly sure most of us who watch TV do it <em>not</em> via a tuner but through things like iTunes, cable, IPTV, PlayStation, Xbox, etc. I think a HDMI connection is enough. Brown?
