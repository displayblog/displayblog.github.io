<p><a href="http://www.asymco.com/2012/07/13/how-many-lumia/">Horace Dediu</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If we then use comScore&acirc;&euro;&trade;s figure for total smartphone users (110 million) then the data would suggest that there are 330k Lumias in use in the US. This would have been accummulated over a sales period of about four months.</blockquote></p>
<p>If being unique is your thing, and you don't want to resort to carrying around a crappy smartphone, the Lumia 800 or 900 seem to be excellent choices.</p>
