Regarding rumors about McGraw-Hill's textbooks being available on Apple's tablet (2m 50s):</p>
<blockquote><p>Yeah, Very exciting. Yes, they'll make their announcement tomorrow on this one. We have worked with Apple for quite a while. And the Tablet is going to be based on the iPhone operating system and so it will be transferable. So what you are going to be able to do now -- we have a consortium of e-books. And we have 95% of all our materials that are in e-book format on that one. So now with the tablet you're going to open up the higher education market, the professional market. The tablet is going to be just really terrific.</blockquote><br />
The tablet is based on the iPhone OS: Not surprising but interesting that McGraw spilled the beans on CNBC. I am certain that McGraw-Hill's textbooks will not be prominently marketed on Apple's tablet nor will Apple be working with the company on stuff requiring a tight lip. Also interesting is the possibility that Apple's tablet might be called simply Tablet.
