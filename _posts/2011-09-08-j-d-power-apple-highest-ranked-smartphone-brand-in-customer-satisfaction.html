<blockquote><p>For a fifth consecutive time, Apple ranks highest among manufacturers of smartphones in customer satisfaction with a score of 795 and performs particularly well in ease of operation, operating system, features and physical design. Motorola (763) and HTC (762) follow Apple in the smartphone rankings.</blockquote></p>
<p>The iPhone is the only smartphone that garnered five out of five Power Circle Ratings, which represents "Among the Best". Both Motorola and HTC were given just three or "About Average".</p>
