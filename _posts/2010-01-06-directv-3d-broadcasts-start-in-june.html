<p>At this point, it seems 3D is here to stay. DirecTV will begin 3D broadcasts in June, the first in the US to offer 3D TV content. There will be three 3D channels at launch: PPV, DirecTV On Demand, a free 3D sample demo. You'll need to get a software upgrade but these channels will be available to all DirecTV HD customers. Content partners include: AEG/AEG Digital Media, CBS, Fox Sports/FSN, Golden Boy Promotions, HDNet, MTV, NBC Universal, Turner Broadcasting System. You'll need three components to make this work: a 3D-capable TV, 3D glasses and DirecTV. Not being bothered by putting on geeky 3D glasses to watch TV would also help.
