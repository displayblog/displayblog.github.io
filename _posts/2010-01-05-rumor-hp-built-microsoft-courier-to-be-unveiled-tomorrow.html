<p><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/05/ahead-of-apple-microsoft-and-hp-to-reveal-slate-pc/">The New York Times</a> via <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/05/microsoft-to-reveal-hp-slate-tomorrow/">Engadget</a>: Have you seen videos of Microsoft's Courier multimedia dual-screen slate? (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=microsoft+courier&amp;search_type=&amp;aq=f">YouTube link</a>) It is almost unbelievably cool. Unbelievable because it is coming from Microsoft, who has made gazillions copying others, not creating things new. Rumor has it that Microsoft will be unveiling a HP-built Courier at CES. I hope it does because I think competition will help drive massive innovation in this space, a space that should bring big smiles to those who like to take handwritten notes, draw, scrap, etc.</p>
<p>I just purchased a Cachet classic sketchbook for exactly the same purpose for $7.95 at Barnes &amp; Noble. I bought this one among many because it exuded quality, was made in England using Canford paper. I will probably continue to buy notepads at the beginning of each year even if there was something like Microsoft's Courier on the market. Why? Because I like the feel of pen/pencil on high-quality paper. And because something like the Courier would be significantly more expensive than $7.95, require daily recharging, monthly back ups, annual upgrades and a single drop on concrete or coffee spill would ruin it, driving me insane. A rugged version with a design equally nice however...</p>
