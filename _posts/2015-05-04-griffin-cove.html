<p><a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/cove-an-elegant-home-recharging-center">Indiegogo</a>: In my family we have five portable devices that need USB charging; there are USB cables everywhere. Cove by Griffin hides the cables as well as the devices inside a beautiful box. I think I need one, but it's a bit expensive: US$150, with a December 2015 estimated delivery date.</p>
