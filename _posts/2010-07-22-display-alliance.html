<p>What is Display Alliance? A community website. An Internet marketing cooperative. According to ShopJimmy's Jimmy Vosika:</p>
<blockquote><p>Display Alliance is an aggregation of "crowdsourced" content related to the display industry. It's a cool site and concept, and I hope it takes off (not merely because they syndicated my post).</blockquote></p>
<p>Display Alliance enables display-related companies to work together, bypass traditional media channels and deliver value to a target audience. Here's the open invitation:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you work within the display industry, this is the site where you can publish display-related articles that feature your products, solutions and customers.</p>
<p>This site is not an association; it's a marketing cooperative.  There are no dues or membership fees.  The only qualification you need to post here is the ability to deliver remarkable value to Display Alliance subscribers and visitors.</p>
<p>To post on Display Alliance, signup (it's free) to become a contributing member. </blockquote></p>
<p>I've been posting at Display Alliance and getting positive results. More information at <a href="http://www.displayalliance.com/">Display Alliance</a>.</p>
