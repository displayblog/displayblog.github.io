<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/article_email/softbank-picks-sharp-as-partner-for-low-cost-smartphones-1408357352-lMyQjAxMTA0MDEwODExNDgyWj">The Wall Street Journal</a>: SoftBank, who owns Sprint, worked with Sharp to develop the Aquos Crystal. According to <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/8/18/6030425/sharp-acquos-crystal-x-japan-smartphone-sprint">The Verge</a> the Sharp Aquos Crystal is a mid-range 5-inch Android smartphone with a 1280x720 pixel format powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 400 processor.</p>
<p>The bezel around the 5-inch LCD &mdash; left, right, <em>and</em> top &mdash; are thin, and seems more space efficient than the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/06/10/lg-g3-space-efficient/">LG G3</a>. Sharp's designers pushed the display all the way to the top and brought down the front-facing camera and sensors; taking selfies might require some adjustments.</p>
<p>The design is unique enough to warrant a second look. But Sprint? If SoftBank wants traction on Sprint, the company should offer the Aquos Crystal unlocked.</p>
