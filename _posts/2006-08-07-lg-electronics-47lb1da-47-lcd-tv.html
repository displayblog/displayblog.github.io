<p>The 47LB1DA is a 47" LCD TV that is digital cable ready that features a Full HD resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. The unit has a VSB chipset, LGE's fifth generation. VSB stands for Vestigial Side Band and is an analog modulation technique that reduces the spectrum needed to transmit information through cable TV or over-the-air (OTA) broadcasts. LGE's 47LB1DA uses a 14-bit color processor that generates billions of colors, 1600:1 contrast ratio and uses the company's XD Engine that enhances color reproduction. The unit has ATSC, NTSC and QAM TV tuners and is CableCard compatible. It also has a TV Guide On-screen program guide, and two HDMI with HDCP inputs. If you intend to install it on a wall, the 47LB1DA is VESA compatible. The MSRP is $3999.<img src="http://us.lge.com/download/product/image/1000000922/LP1M_l.jpg" height="310" width="390" /><br />
LGE's 55LP1M: 55" LCD TV</p>
<p>The 47LB1DA is not even the largest that LGE has to offer in the LCD TV format. For a long time now, LGE has been offering the 55LP1M, and as the name suggests, it is a 55" monster with 1920 x 1080 resolution, 1200:1 CR, 500 cd/m2, 178-degree viewing angle and 8ms response times. My guess is that the 47" LCD TV will look something similar to the 55".</p>
