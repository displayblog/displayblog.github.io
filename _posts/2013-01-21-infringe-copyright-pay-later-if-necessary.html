<blockquote><p>After <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/16/world/europe/uk-helicopter-crash/index.html">a helicopter crashed in central London</a> last Wednesday, the London Evening Standard found a photo snapped by a witness named <a href="https://twitter.com/craiglet/">Craig Jenner</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/craiglet/status/291458207577153536/photo/1/large">shared on Twitter</a>. Unable to obtain permission from Jenner prior to its paper going to the press, the Evening Standard went ahead and published the image on its front page.</blockquote></p>
<p>The London Evening Standard wasn't the only one; there were Caters News, the Daily Mail, the Guardian, the Press Association, the Sun, and Sky News.</p>
