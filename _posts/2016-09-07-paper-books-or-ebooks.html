<p>[ <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/culture/paper-or-e-book-americans-still-prefer-paper.html">TreeHugger</a> ] According to Pew Research Center's survey that was conducted on March 7 through April 4, 2016 called "Book Reading 2016":</p>
<ul>
<li>6% read only digital books</li>
<li>28% read both print and digital books</li>
<li>38% read only print books</li>
<li>26% read no books</li><br />
</ul><br />
I read both print and digital books. Digital books I read are books I don't plan to read completely, books that don't require a lot of sustained focus. The print books I purchase and borrow from public libraries are books I plan to read from beginning to end. These books are books I not only want to read but to study and learn.</p>
<p>I prefer the experience of paper books. Not all paper, but good quality paper and books that are hard bound or leather bound. The physical experience of holding a paper book and flipping good quality pages as I&nbsp;read is superb. But I will say gliding my finger over smooth slick&nbsp;glass, reading on a display with millions of pixels I can't distinguish is great too. I usually don't mark up my paper books unless they are textbook or textbook-like books, but I almost always highlight and add notes on my e-books. Now let me tell you something: searching for my highlights or notes is something I seldom do, but the smart folks who study retention, learning, etc. say it helps when you read with a pen, pencil, or stylus.&nbsp;I think I remember better when I read paper books.</p>
<p><em>But 26% read no books?</em></p>
