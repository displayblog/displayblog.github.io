<p>Nick Bilton, <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/disruptions-apple-is-said-to-be-developing-a-curved-glass-smart-watch/">The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., Apple is experimenting with wristwatch-like devices made of curved glass, according to people familiar with the company&acirc;&euro;&trade;s explorations, who spoke on the condition that they not be named because they are not allowed to publicly discuss unreleased products. Such a watch would operate on Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s iOS platform, two people said, and stand apart from competitors based on the company&acirc;&euro;&trade;s understanding of how such glass can curve <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/18/wearing-your-computer-on-your-sleeve/">around the human body</a>.</blockquote></p>
<p>Flexible glass? It's been some time since <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2012/06/04/corning-willow-glass/">Corning announced Willow</a>. But if it's curved glass, that's old news: Nokia N9, iPod nano, Nexus S, etc. So what is Apple working on? My guess: A flexible band, with a flexible display and flexible electronics.</p>
<p>There is a small but growing trend of what's called wearable computing with two major product categories. On the one end is anchored by watches like the Pebble, a US$150 Bluetooth watch sporting an e-paper display that connect to the iPhone and Android smartphones providing notification-based conveniences and apps. Those apps enable the Pebble to control music on your smartphone, track speed, distance, etc. for biking and running.</p>
<p>On the other end of the wearable computing spectrum are bracelets, like the $150 Nike FuelBand. The FuelBand features a simple dot-matrix LED display and constantly measures your activities: running, walking up stairs, washing dishes, lifting up your baby, etc. The FuelBand companion app, which is iOS and web only, generates attractive activity graphs.</p>
<p>Wearable computing at the moment focuses on convenience and/or activity monitoring, but it could be so much more. <em>If</em> Apple enters the wearable computing space with a flexible band I can guarantee one thing: This space will get a lot more exciting.</p>
<p><em>Update 2013.02.28:</em> <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-28/apple-supplier-corning-sees-three-year-wait-for-flexible-display.html">Bloomberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Corning Inc., the maker of glass for Apple Inc. iPhones, said it will probably take at least three years before companies start making flexible displays using its new Willow material.</blockquote></p>
<p>Even though Willow has been out for some time Willow-equipped devices are three years out according to James Clappin, president of Glass Technologies at Corning. I hope he's proven to be too conservative.</p>
