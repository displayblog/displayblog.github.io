<p><a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/4000/apples-11inch-upgraded-macbook-air-review-do-16ghz-and-4gb-make-a-difference/2">AnandTech</a> asked the question: Do the 1.6GHz and 4GB upgrades make a difference on the 11.6-inch MacBook Air?</p>
<p>The chart above is the "Retouch Artists Speed Test". I took the liberty of using AnandTech's results and instead of total seconds to complete the test, focused on how much slower the maxed out 11.6-inch MacBook Air was compared to the fastest, which is at the top.</p>
<p>The stock 11.6-inch is 41.4 seconds slower than the 15.4-inch MacBook Pro at the top. By upgrading the CPU from 1.4GHz to 1.6GHz and opting for the 4GB RAM upgrade the maxed out 11.6-inch MacBook Air is 10.1 seconds faster than the stock $999 version. That's a 13.9% improvement! Both are still way slower than the i7-based 15.4-inch MacBook Pro, but the maxed out version comes close enough to matching the performance of last year's 13.3-inch MacBook Pro powered by a 2.26GHz Core 2 Duo.</p>
