Microsoft's Aaron Woodman was on The Engadget Show. He had a surprise: a prototype Windows Phone 7 Series by LG. The LG phone had a slide-out QWERTY keyboard, dedicated real buttons for camera, volume, power and the required back, home, search buttons. The LG prototype also had a 5MP camera with flash on the back. Source: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/02/27/exclusive-lgs-windows-phone-7-series-early-prototype-unveiled/">Engadget</a></p>
