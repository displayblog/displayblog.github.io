<p>I have written about the TS-24W8h, which was a debranded HP w2408h (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/12/17/ts-series-display-ts-24w8h-refurbished-24-lcd-monitor/">TS Series Display TS-24W8h: Refurbished 24" LCD Monitor</a></em>) and the display was flawless. Now comes a review of a slightly smaller 23-inch version for just $160. From <a href="http://www.bonafidereviews.com/review-of-23-hp-de-branded-hdmi-1080p-widescreen-lcd-monitor-wspeakers/">Bona Fide Reviews</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the price this 'de-branded' monitor is a good one truly. It works great and the colors are near perfect.</blockquote><br />
A smart way to save money on computer-related gear is to purchase refurbished or, as is the case with this 23-inch HP LCD monitor, de-branded versions. Whatever was going to go wrong already did and the company fixed it for you. For that, you get to pay less. That sounds like a great deal to me.</p>
