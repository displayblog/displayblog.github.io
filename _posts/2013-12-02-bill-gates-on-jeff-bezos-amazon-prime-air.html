<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/2/5167822/bill-gates-supports-amazon-drone-delivery">The Verge</a>: Bill Gates on CNN's <em>The Lead</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Physical products delivered by drone, I'd say he's probably on the optimistic or perhaps even the overly optimistic end of that. It's great that people have dreams like that.</p>
<p>If we can make the cost of delivery easier, then it's not just books. It's getting health supplies out to people in tough places. Drones overall will be more impactful than I think people recognize in positive ways to help society. </p>
<p>Tech pioneers dream big dreams, and I think he's allowed to have a vision there. It would be great if we could come anywhere close to that for a lot of products.</blockquote></p>
<p>What is not to like about a 30-minute drone delivery service? It's fun to dream, but there are lots of hurdles to make this a reality: battery technology, protection from mother nature (weather, birds, etc.), legislation of safe traffic laws for drones, theft, etc. I wouldn't be surprised if Amazon designs a Prime Air docking station for the home where the drones settle down, unlock the packages, and as the drones fly off the packages are secured in a way where only the recipients can open. And <em>way</em> into the future we wouldn't need most of this stuff to get delivered; we'd just pay for the downloadable 3D print file, and print them. Maybe in less than 30 minutes.</p>
