<p><a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">Apple</a>'s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) is when we should expect the next-generation iPhone to be announced. We've all seen the stolen iPhone prototype (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/04/19/iphon-hd-more-details/">iPhone HD: More Details</a></em>) but what I'm interested in watching is Steve Jobs doing a proper introduction on one of the days between the 7th and 11th of June at Moscone West in San Francisco.</p>
