<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/1/9/2693081/samsung-oled-tv--second-half-of-year/in/2459001">The Verge</a>: The <a href="/2011/12/25/lg-display-55-inch-oled/">LG Electronics 55-inch OLED TV</a> uses a special type of OLED called <a href="/2012/01/09/woled/">WOLED</a>. On the other hand, there's nothing special about the 55-inch Super OLED TV by Samsung, except that it's the real OLED deal. On sale in the second half of 2012.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.slashgear.com/samsung-55-inch-super-oled-tv-hands-on-11208794/">Michael Crider, SlashGear</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Black levels are downright unbelievable &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; when the screen displays a centered image on a black background, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s impossible to spot the bezel. Movement is fluid and graceful, even when the entire screen is filled with motion and eye-searing color.</blockquote></p>
<p>Besides the ridiculously high price it will most likely demand, how is Samsung managing differential aging among the red, green, and blue? And what is the expected lifetime?</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> <a href="http://crave.cnet.co.uk/televisions/samsung-oled-tv-coming-to-the-uk-this-spring-50006941/">Luke Westaway, CNET UK</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The company has told us we can expect to see the 55-inch 'Super' OLED TV around the spring, though there's no exact date yet.</blockquote></p>
<p><em>Update 2012.05.17:</em> The Samsung 55-inch OLED TV now has a model number: ES9500. How brilliantly unmemorable. The ES9500 will be available in South Korea in the second half of this year. Unsurprisingly the price is stratospheric. <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/samsung-start-sales-oled-tv-second-half-071538658--finance.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter">Associated Press</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Samsung said the 55-inch TV using the ultra-thin display will be retailed at over 10 million won, or more than $9,000.</blockquote></p>
<p><em>Update 2012.06.02:</em> A birdie whispered to me the target price for Samsung's 55-inch OLED TV at the end of the year: $2500. Samsung has converted its Gen 7 LCD capacity, probably from its now dissolved S-LCD joint venture with Sony, into OLED. If this is true, that would be the beginning of the end for other TV brands.</p>
