<blockquote><p>3DFusion Corp. announced today its joint collaboration with Cirque Du Soleil and the Mirage Hotel in celebrating the 5th anniversary of the Beatles "LOVE" theatrical extravaganza. Showcased at the Mirage Hotel, 3DFusion introduces their 52", glasses free 3DTV display, featuring the Cirque Du Soleil, "LOVE" performance, currently on stage at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas.</blockquote></p>
<p>The glasses-free 3D technology showcased at the Mirage lobby is the company's 3DFMax 52-inch Auto Stereoscopic Display (ASD). There are no viewing angle restrictions, ghosting, or visual discomfort according to 3DFusion.</p>
<p>Cirque Marketing Director Jennifer Seigler:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think the 3DFusion screens and their "LOVE" content conversion is AMAZING. People stop in their tracks to watch...become instantly engaged. This is just the thing for our shows, and we are very pleased and excited.</blockquote></p>
<p>3D that looks good without 3D glasses, and free of visual discomfort. I have to see this.</p>
