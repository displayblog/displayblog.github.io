<p><a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/ultrasharp-32-up3214q-review,3744.html">Christian Eberle, Tom's Hardware</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you've made it this far, it should be fairly obvious that Dell delivers a winning product in its UP3214Q. Yes, the price of admission is substantial, but this is a bleeding-edge product that performs far better than most first-gen technology. If you have the necessary graphics hardware, the UP3214Q is a true plug-and-play 4K solution.</p>
<p>Asus gave us excellent build quality with its PQ321Q, but Dell goes a little bit further. This is the most metal we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve seen in any computer component outside of a case. Not only do you get a slick aluminum band around the panel&acirc;&euro;&trade;s perimeter, but the entire base and upright are made from the same material. We also really like the easy snap-on installation of those parts.</p>
<p>Feature-wise, the UP3214Q is quite complete. Three digital inputs take care of any potential (and relevant) source. We would have really liked to see HDMI 2.0 compatibility, but admittedly that interface is still in its infancy, having only been ratified a few months ago. Both DisplayPort connectors support full resolution at 60 Hz though, so long as your video card is multi-stream-compatible. We also applaud the inclusion of four USB 3.0 ports and an SD card reader.</blockquote></p>
<p>US$3500. Steep even for a 31.5-inch 3840x2160 <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2012/09/01/sharp-igzo/">IGZO</a> IPS LCD from Sharp with a 98% Adobe RGB 1998 color gamut.</p>
