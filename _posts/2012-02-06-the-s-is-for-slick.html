<p><a href="http://www.splatf.com/2012/02/iphone-4s-review">Dan Frommer</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>My gadget-buying philosophy is to buy the best one you can afford now. There will always be faster, better ones in the future. But the only thing in life you can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t get back is time. The time you spend waiting for the next new thing is time you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re spending with crappier tools. Make sure that goes into your equation.</p>
<p>This doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t mean you should buy every new iPhone or iPad, or spend money on gadgets that you should be saving for more important things. But anyway, if you need a new phone now, you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re not going to do better than the iPhone 4S.</blockquote></p>
