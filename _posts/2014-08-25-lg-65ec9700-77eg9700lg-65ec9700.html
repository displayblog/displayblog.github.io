<p><a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/newsroom/contents/64643">LG</a>: The LG 65EC9700 is a 56-inch 4K (3840x2160) OLED curved TV. The 65EC9700 and the larger 77-inch 77EG9700 feature everything that's next generation: 4K, OLED, and curved.</p>
<p>Unlike the typical RGB-strip sub-pixel structure used in most TV panels LG uses a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2012/01/09/woled/">WRGB OLED panel</a> developed by LG Display.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/lg-bets-pricey-oled-technology-060536835.html">an Associated Press report</a> the 65-inch 65EC9700 will be priced at &#8361;12 million or about US$12000. LG will start taking pre-orders starting this week in Korea. Both models will soon be made available in North America and Europe. Expensive, but buying the latest and greatest has always been.</p>
