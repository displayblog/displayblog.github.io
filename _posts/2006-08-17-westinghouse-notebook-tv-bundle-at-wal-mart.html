<p>Never heard of Westinghouse? Where have you been? Westinghouse Digital is a new brand that has been doing very well at retailers with decent products at barebone prices. That was with LCD TVs. Now Westinghouse will enter the razor-thin margin PC business with its own notebook.</p>
<p><img src="http://a330.g.akamai.net/7/330/25829/20060816160837/www.twice.com/articles/images/TWICE/20060816/West_bundle_H2%20copy1.jpg" height="117" width="216" /></p>
<p>The notebook PC has a 14" wide LCD with a 1280 x 800 resolution. Equipped with an Intel Celeron M 410 CPU (kinda slow), Windows XP Home, ATI Xpress 200M GPU, 60GB HD, 512MB DDR2 RAM, 8x CD/DVD+/-RW DL, 802.11b/g and 4-in-1 card reader, the notebook is ideal for someone who is not into 3D gaming and wants a decent computer on a budget.</p>
<p>The TV is a 19" wide version with 1440 x 900 resolution and has two HD inputs with integrated speakers.&Acirc;&nbsp; The TV can be used as a monitor as well as a TV. Of course, with those HD inputs, you can hook up your DVD or PlayStation to it as well. You can get this bundle at Wal-Mart for $989. A great bargain!</p>
