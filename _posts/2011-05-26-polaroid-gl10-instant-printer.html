<blockquote><p>This little printer connects to your computer or smartphone and produces 3&Atilde;&mdash;4&acirc;&euro;&sup3; prints in about 45 seconds. The paper is probably going to be super expensive, but hey.</blockquote></p>
<p>Two questions: How does it connect to a smartphone? And does it work with an iPhone?</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> Bluetooth or USB are the connection options. And it seems the iPhone is not on the list of supported smartphones. Priced at US$169.99. A bit expensive.</p>
