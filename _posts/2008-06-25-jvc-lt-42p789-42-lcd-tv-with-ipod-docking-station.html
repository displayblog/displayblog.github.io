<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=jvc">JVC</a>'s LT-42P789 is a handsome <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a> featuring a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=42"">42"</a> TFT LCD panel with a pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a>. In addition to the usual specifications the LT-42P789 has a special feature that allows for the docking of your <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=ipod">iPod</a>. This is a natural coupling: the iPod, which is a portable digital device that can carry an enormous amount of video content, with a nice 42" LCD TV. Or is it?</p>
<p>The biggest problem with this combination is that HD content from iTunes is not 1080p as far as I know. My guess is that iTunes HD content is at best 720p, which requires a native pixel format of 1280 x 720 to be viewed without scaling. And that's where my next point comes in: scaling must be done extremely well to get barely good-enough HD quality from iTunes to display well on a massive 42" LCD with a pixel format of 1920 x 1080. Most likely iTunes HD content will not scale so well, but I'm crossing my fingers.</p>
<p>I want this combination to work well. I just hope Apple will continue ratchet up its offerings all the way up to 1080p so we are not forced to purchase a Blu-ray player and very expensive Blu-ray titles.</p>
