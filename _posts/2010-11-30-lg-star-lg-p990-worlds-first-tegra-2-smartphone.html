<p><a href="http://www.gsm-israel.co.il/&times;&mdash;&times;&ldquo;&times;&copy;&times;&bull;&times;&ordf;/lg-star-hands">GSM Israel</a> &rarr; <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/30/lg-star-struts-its-stuff-on-film-toys-with-an-iphone-4-video/">Engadget</a>: The LG Star is the world's first NVIDIA Tegra 2 smartphone sporting a large 4-inch LCD, an 8 megapixel camera with LED flash, HDMI, and running on Android 2.2.</p>
<p>Some observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The touch response seems to be extremely fast.</li>
<li>The large 4-inch LCD might be of the IPS variety as the black levels were impressively dark with decent viewing angles.</li>
<li>There seems to be a pinkish tint to the LCD on the LG Star compared to the iPhone 4.</li>
<li>I'm not sure if the LG Star's brightness setting was maxed out, but if it was then it didn't seem as bright as that on the iPhone 4.<br />
</li></ul></p>
<p>NVIDIA's dual-core Tegra 2 chipset allows the LG Star to record video in 1080p!</p>
