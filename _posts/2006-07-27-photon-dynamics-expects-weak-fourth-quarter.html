<p>Photon, based in San Jose, CA, manufacturer of integrated yield management solutions (equipment that checks for errors on LCDs) is looking at a decline in revenues in the fourth quarter due to its customers delaying investment decisions due to reduced profitability. A seasonally slow second quarter in addition to an increase in inventory led to losses and low profits.</p>
