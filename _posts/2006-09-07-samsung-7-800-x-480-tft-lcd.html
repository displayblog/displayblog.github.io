<p>Samsung has begun mass production of 7" TFT LCD with 800 x 480 resolution that uses its single-chip driver. A 7" LCD typically has a very low resolution of 480 x 234. 800 x 480 resolution has been seen in larger 8" and 9" LCDs, but not on 7", until now. The single-chip driver replaces four to seven driver ICs and eliminates the need for a printed circuit board (PCB) that would have a timing controller (TCON) and power components. Samsung is using its Amorphous Silicon Gate (ASG) technology that integrates driver ICs directly on the glass. Samsung is planning to expand capacity to 10 million 7" units by 2007.</p>
<p>With GPS navigation systems becoming very popular in automobiles, I can finally expect to see better graphics in the near future. Current GPS-based graphics are dismal, to say the least. A day will come when we will see pictures and video that look very close to life. Can we get 1280 x 800 on a 7"? The reason I ask: Imagine 720p HD video content to aid in your destination search. Sounds cool to me.</p>
