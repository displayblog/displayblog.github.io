<blockquote><p>[...] The LG VL600, Verizon&acirc;&euro;&trade;s LTE launch USB modem device, is only compatible with Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7. Another modem, the Pantech UML290, will be available soon after launch, but it doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t appear to be Mac-compatible either [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>Not good news, but I'm waiting for smartphones that make use of Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, and in particular an iPhone 4S. A tethered iPhone 4S would be a far more elegant solution than a USB modem: stick it to the side of your MacBook and instantly it becomes aesthetically less pleasing.</p>
