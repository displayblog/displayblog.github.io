<p>Monterey Boats unveiled its all-new 330 Sport Yacht measuring 35' from stem to stem and a comfortable beam of 11'3". Engine choices range from a 260hp diesel to a 320hp twin-gas. I'm not rich enough to be interested in boats,but this one comes with a 26" LCD TV. This probably is nothing new to the world of expensive boats and yachts. I wonder what the largest LCD TV installation on a boat is...</p>
