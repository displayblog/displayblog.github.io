<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/12/23/2657492/samsung-touchwiz-fails-customers">Vlad Savov, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Earlier today, Samsung revealed that it won't update the Galaxy S, its most successful smartphone to date, to the latest version of Android. [...] I take grave issue with it. This is a decision based not on technical constraints, as Samsung would have you believe, but on hubris.</blockquote></p>
<p>Samsung shipped almost 20 million Galaxy S phones and that means there are almost as many pissed off customers.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> An alternative view by <a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2011/12/23/the-galaxy-s-not-getting-ics-isnt-a-samsung-problem-its-an-android-problem/">Matthew Panzarino, The Next Web</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The problem isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t Samsung, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s systemic to Android as a whole. The makers of Android hardware see little benefit in updating even devices that are less than a year old. And, though I think it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a punk move, I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t blame them. There is little to no return to be had.</blockquote></p>
<p>Though that may be true, that this is a systematic Android problem, by not taking care of its current customers there will be "little to no" customers who return to Samsung for another round of getting screwed.</p>
<p><em>Update 2:</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/12/23/android-updates">John Gruber</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>One company <a href="http://theunderstatement.com/post/11982112928/android-orphans-visualizing-a-sad-history-of-support">clearly has more respect for its customers</a>; that company is also clearly more successful. If you don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t see the connection, go ahead and keep your head in the sand.</blockquote></p>
