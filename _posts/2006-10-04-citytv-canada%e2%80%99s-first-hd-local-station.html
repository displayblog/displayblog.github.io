<p>Citytv will show all of its local news and many of its original programming in HD starting Monday, September 4, 2006. It seems Citytv will go with 1080i content and not 720p. IMO, 1080i content allows for broadcasters to cram more channels because it requires less bandwidth due to its interlaced method of updating content on a TV screen. And because of this (the causal relationship is likely to be the reverse), the CityNews article is reporting that HDTV sets are selling well.</p>
