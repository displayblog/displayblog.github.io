<p>Facts: This is a world&#39;s first according to the two companies. 1000 lumens and a 12,000:1 contrast ratio is offered through its Dynamic Black technology. PerkinElmer&#39;s Cermax Xenon lamp technology is used to provide color accuracy, high luminance, immediate on/off capabilities, and extended lifetimes.</p>
<p>Opinion: What I like most about this announcement is the immediate on/off capabilities. There have been many times when everyone in a room waited ackwardly for the projector to "warm up". Of course, the 1080p resolution is a step in the right direction. Who pays for a projector with only 800 x 600 pixels these days?</p>
