<p>[ <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tim-cook-apple-doesnt-make-its-products-in-china-because-its-cheaper-2015-12-20">MarketWatch</a> ] The Chinese have more skilled workers, more&nbsp;than in the U.S.,&nbsp;more than in Germany,&nbsp;according to Tim Cook, in an interview with Charlie Rose on <em>60 Minutes</em>. Here's Cook:</p>
<blockquote><p>The U.S., over time, began to stop having as many vocational kind of skills. I mean, you can take every tool and die maker in the United States and probably put them in a room that we're currently sitting in. In China, you would have to have multiple football fields.</blockquote><br />
China has more than 1.3 billion people. The U.S. has a bit less than 320 million. China has more than quadruple the number of people than the United States. Like Cook explained, China has been building&nbsp;up its manufacturing infrastructure while the U.S. has been doing the opposite for quite some time.&nbsp;So I can understand there are more skilled laborers -- as in quantity, as in the <em>number</em> of&nbsp;skilled laborers --&nbsp;in China than in the U.S. But what about the quality of those skilled laborers? Are Chinese laborers more skilled than those in the U.S.? Germany? Japan? South Korea? I don't think Cook answered Rose's question;&nbsp;Rose's question was of quality and Cook answered as if the question was of quantity.</p>
<p>Let's consider a hypothetical: China has the infrastructure to&nbsp;manufacture iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks at the quantity and quality levels Apple wants. But not price. Do you think Apple would be building their stuff in China?</p>
<p>This is what I think: The U.S., Germany, Japan, and South Korea have highly stilled laborers, but Apple builds in China because China has the infrastructure to build the products at the quality, quantity, and <em>price</em>&nbsp;Apple wants.</p>
