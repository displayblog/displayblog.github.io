<blockquote><p>This quarter saw Apple and Android drive record smartphone sales. Apple's share of the smartphone market surpassed Research In Motion (RIM) in North America to put it second behind Android while Android volumes also grew rapidly making it the No. 2 operating system worldwide.</blockquote></p>
<p>In terms of worldwide "mobile terminal" hardware brands in the third quarter, Apple passed RIM for #4.</p>
<ol>
<li>Nokia: 28.2%</li>
<li>Samsung: 17.2%</li>
<li>LG: 6.6%</li>
<li>Apple: 3.2%</li>
<li>Research In Motion: 2.9%</li><br />
</ol></p>
<p>In terms of worldwide smartphone operating systems, Android jumped to #2 behind Symbian in the third quarter.</p>
<ol>
<li>Symbian: 36.6%</li>
<li>Android: 25.5%</li>
<li>iOS: 16.7%</li>
<li>BlackBerry: 14.8%</li><br />
</ol></p>
<p>In North America, Android grabbed the top spot in the third quarter, followed by iOS. Gartner is estimating that 75-80% of Verizon's smartphone sales in the third quarter were running Android. If that's true, that puts a lot of pressure on Apple to get an iPhone running on Verizon, and soon.</p>
