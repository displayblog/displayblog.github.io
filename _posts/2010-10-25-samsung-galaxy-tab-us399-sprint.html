<p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab will be available on Sprint for just $399 on November 14th. Of course with a brand new two-year contract. If you're in a hurry Verizon will be offering the 7-inch iPad competitor a few days earlier on the 11th of November. You get to choose from two data plans: $29.99 for 2GB or $59.99 for 5GB. Need mobile hotspot capability? That'll be an <em>extra</em> $29.99 per month. I think the Verizon deal makes more sense to me, especially if you need the mobile hotspot feature.</p>
<p>With a MiFi bundle you get to choose: $20 for 1GB, $35 for 3GB, $50 for 5GB or $80 for 10GB. And the MiFi, by definition, is a mobile hotspot. Source: <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2010/10/sprint-to-offer-samsung-galaxy-tab-nov-14-for-399-with-contract.ars">Ars Technica</a></p>
