<p><a href="http://www.mdrobertson.com/heaven/">Mark Robertson</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For me, the most conducive part is a faithful, unflinching peering into the way others create symbols and glyphs and words and phrases to understand the world.</p>
<p>Language-learning, for the rest of us, is a reconcilitory activity. We are estranged and if you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re like me, there is little you can buy that feels better than solo-time. But the great task of life&acirc;&euro;&ldquo;and that which makes it worth living&acirc;&euro;&ldquo;is participating in the de-alienation,&acirc;&euro;&ldquo;that is, tearing down the Babellian walls, that keep us in tidy distance from the Other.</blockquote></p>
<p>I took four years of Japanese: Two in high school and two in college. Now, many years later, I am left able to speak only a few phrases. But when I look back to why I was interested in learning Japanese, I remember I was curious. I was curious about the minimalistic culture, the people, the fantastic anime, the amazing technology. I wanted to know Japan and connect. I still do and hope one of these days I will get to spend some time in Japan and soak everything in.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> Speaking of language acquisition and Japanese, <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2012/02/14/siri-leaks-her-own-upcoming-ability-to-speak-japanese/">Siri can now speak Japanese</a>.</p>
