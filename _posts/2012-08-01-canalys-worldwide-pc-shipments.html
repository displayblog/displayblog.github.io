<p><a href="http://www.canalys.com/newsroom/2012-will-bring-new-world-record-pc-shipments">Canalys</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple retook the overall lead with an estimated 19% share of global PC shipments, helped by strong iPad sales. &acirc;&euro;&tilde;There is now a large base of replacement buyers that simply must have the latest Apple product, and the decision to continue shipping the iPad 2 at lower price points has opened up new customers, for example in education,&acirc;&euro;&trade; Evans added.</blockquote></p>
<p>With the iPad included in PC shipments Apple looks to be unbeatable with a 55% lead in PC <em>shipments</em> over #2 HP. Canalys, like all market research firms, conveniently mixes shipments into the channel and sales to end users. If sales to end users were used for HP, #3 Lenovo, #4 Acer, and #5 Dell the lead Apple has over them would be even bigger.</p>
