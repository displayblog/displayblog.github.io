<p><a href="http://skyballoonstudio.com/capture">Sky Balloon</a> <em>via</em> <a href="http://minimalmac.com/post/7288736254/capture-the-quick-video-camera-for-iphone">Minimal Mac</a>: Capture is an iOS app that starts capturing video the moment it launches. 99&cent;</p>
<p>I purchased Capture immediately! Like Patrick Rhone I have three beautiful kids that require a fast-draw video app. I have not experienced another app as functional or minimal!</p>
<p>The one quibble: pressing the Home button on your iPhone quits Capture, which saves the video to your Camera Roll. Nice and simple, but the 'click' sound of the Home button gets recorded. Not a big deal. My recommendation: touch the red dot/record time to stop recording.</p>
