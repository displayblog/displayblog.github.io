<p><a href="http://gizmodo.com/5015347/35+inch-digital-photo-frame-from-hp-small-but-chic">Gizmodo</a>: <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=hp">HP</a> has a digital photo frame and it's a small one, 3.5" to be exact. The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=3.5"">3.5"</a> TFT LCD sports a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=320-x-240">320 x 240</a> pixel format and can read photos from SD, SDHC, and MMC cards. It is portable, but I wonder why you would carry this thing around when you have a mobile phone. The US$76 is very affordable, but quite expensive if you consider you actually don't need it. The box design is intriguing as it has a green theme and a ribbon. Maybe this is a special edition for an occasion.</p>
