<p>During the NAB 2008 conference, Panasonic introduced the BT-LH1760 production LCD monitor. Although the size is diminutive compared to regular LCD monitors that have been popping out lately, the performance specifications sure does not disappoint. Panasonic is putting its BT-LH1760 performance up against those of CRT's. This is the first time in a long time since I have seen a small 17" LCD monitor sporting an IPS LCD panel. And I'm quite excited. I'm a fan of IPS and it has been difficult to find any LCD monitor in the general consumer space that feature an IPS panel less than 24".</p>
<p>In addition to IPS technology, this little 17" LCD features what is typical found in fairly expensive LCD TV models: 120Hz frequency. 120Hz is typical incorporated to reduce motion blur. Image interpolation, which generally go side-by-side but does not seem to be the case here, is a system that looks at the current and future frames inserts in-between pixels resulting in much smoother movement and much reduced motion blur.</p>
<p>There is quite a bit more to the BT-LH1760 and it better. For the price of $4500 for a 17" LCD monitor, there better a lot of super qualities.</p>
