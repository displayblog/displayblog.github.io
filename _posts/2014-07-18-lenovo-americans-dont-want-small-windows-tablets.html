<p><a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2455580/lenovo-stops-selling-smallscreen-windows-tablets-in-the-us.html">Agam Shah, PC World</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;In North America, we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re seeing stronger interest in the larger screen sizes for Windows tablets and are pleased with initial customer demand for the ThinkPad 10,&acirc;&euro; said Raymond Gorman, a Lenovo spokesman, in an email.</blockquote></p>
<p>Lenovo stopped selling its ThinkPad 8 and Miix 2 in North America; both sport 8-inch displays.</p>
<blockquote><p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;In other markets, particularly Brazil, China, and Japan, the demand for ThinkPad 8 has been much stronger, so we are adjusting our ThinkPad 8 inventories to meet increasing demand in those markets. If market demand for ThinkPad 8 changes, we will re-evaluate our strategy,&acirc;&euro; Gorman said.</blockquote></p>
<p>Not surprising Americans like larger, and equally not surprised to see countries like Brazil, China, and Japan prefer smaller.</p>
