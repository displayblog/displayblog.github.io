  MSI's X-Slim X340 is an inch-thick notebook PC, sports a fantastic design (<a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250:8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID:11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=\"macbook+air\"&amp;sa=Search\">MacBook
  Air</a>-esque), is ultra-thin (0.78-inch) and costs a penny under US$900. Graphics
  is powered by Intel's GMA 4500MHD. The X340 comes with 2GB of DDR2 RAM, a 320GB
  hard disk, gigabit Ethernet, WiFi, a 4-cell battery with an integrated 1.3 megapixel
  camera, Bluetooth 2.0+EDR, two USB 2.0 ports, HDMI &amp; VGA connections and a SD/MMC
  media reader.\r\n\r\nThe X340 sports a <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250:8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID:11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=adamo&amp;sa=Search\">Adamo</a>-sized
  13.4-inch LCD featuring a 1366 x 768 pixel format. The MacBook Air is just a bit
  smaller at 13.3-inch and a 16:10 aspect ratio'ed 1280 x 800 pixel format.\r\n\r\n<strong>HD
  Viewing</strong> If you were thinking that the 16:9 LCDs on the X340 and Adamo
  are better than the MacBook Air when watching 720p HD content, you'd be wrong. The
  1366 x 768 requires the 1280 x 720 pixel HD content to be scaled up both horizontally
  and vertically. There are no black bars but scaled HD video is never a good idea
  if you want quality. On the MacBook Air you will get horizontal black bars on top
  and on the bottom but the 1280 x 720 pixel HD content will look much better as it
  will not need to be scaled to fit the LCD width wise. "

<p><strong>Not Sexy Enough?</strong> I think MSI has done a decent job with its X-Slim X340 bringing together a solid design and a great price. But there are some quibbles. I don't like how the USB and audio ports, even though they are nicely polished, are exposed on the right. The left side is even uglier. Since aesthetics will be one major reason to get the X-Slim X340 I would have thought MSI would at least try to cover these ports. Although the MacBook Air's connectivity is too limited, I like the seemless design on the MacBook Air much better. Dell does a really good job here too but at the expense of getting to most of the connections a bit more difficult (they are on the back).</p>
<p>If you're okay with a bit of less-than-ultimate sexiness, the X-Slim X340 brings to the table a thin and sexy design for quite a bargain. Although the MSRP is US$899.99 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028ACYKE?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=displ0f-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0028ACYKE">you can already get it for just $799.99</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=displ0f-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0028ACYKE" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />.</p>
