<blockquote><p>If you see the words or initials SPS, Scenes Per Second, AquoMotion, Motionflow XR, Clear Motion Rate, or CMR you now know these numbers do not reflect the actual refresh rate of an HDTV. At best, they are at least double the true number. The spec should read X Hz refresh rate. &Acirc;&nbsp;Check and verify this important specification before purchasing your next TV.</blockquote></p>
<p>Useless marketing terms pretending to mean something when all they do is trick potential LCD TV buyers. Sony uses Motionflow XR, Vizio uses SPS, Samsung uses CMR, Sharp uses AquoMotion, and LG uses TruMotion.</p>
<p>Higher refresh rates mean less motion blur, which simply means a blurring of motion on LCD TVs. And yes, "LED TVs" too since LED TV is just a LCD TV with a LED backlight. You can thank Samsung for that bit of confusion. LCD TV comes with refresh rates of 60Hz, 120Hz, and 240Hz. Anything higher than that is marketing bologna.</p>
<p>All the brands mentioned above want a bigger number than 240Hz on their LCD TV specifications; bigger numbers sell, unfortunate but true. But don't you get hoodwinked. Make sure to find the real refresh rate in the specifications: 60Hz, 120Hz, or 240Hz. If you're a sports nut and detest motion blur you might be better off buying a plasma instead. Or if you're like me who want the very best for the very least and don't mind thick and heavy TVs, go for an old but oh-so-dang-good 34-inch or 36-inch wide Sony XBR CRT TVs, if you can find them.</p>
