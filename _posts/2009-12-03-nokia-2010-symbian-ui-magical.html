<p>Nokia CEO Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, on the new Symbian UI:</p>
<blockquote><p>Magical.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/irol/10/107224/Nokia_CMD_09.pdf">Nokia (PDF)</a>: Multitouch seems to be a requirement on Nokia's planned Symbian UI slated for release in 2010. Nokia stated that the UI was the problem not Symbian and the new look looks nifty. The company also specifically noted capacitive touch technology-based large displays to be mated to Symbian. (I wonder who will work with <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/11/30/nokia-sues-lcd-suppliers/">Nokia, who has sued most LCD manufacturers</a>?) Nokia has a few goals in mind with the new UI: minimize steps to request functions, improve Internet browsing experience, faster UI by threefold, increasing scrolling from 15fps to 60fps, and remove 350 user prompts.</p>
