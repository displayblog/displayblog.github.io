<p><strong><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20100414PD210.html">Taiwan Netbook Panel Suppliers Ship 2.35 Million in March</a></strong>: AU Optronics (AUO) shipped 800K units, HannStar Display shipped another 800K and Chimei Innolux (CMI) shipped 750K for a total of 2.35 million in the month of March. (Samsung shipped 300K and LG Display (LGD) shipped 400K. LGD's numbers do not include the 9.7-inch panels for Apple's iPad, which total about 500K in March, up from 350K in February.) Taiwan-based netbook LCD panel suppliers experienced a slight sequential increase in unit shipments in March thanks to more working days and new netbook launches.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20100414PD211.html">Worldwide 3D LCD TV Market to Reach Four Million Units in 2010</a>j</strong>: Digitimes Research estimates the worldwide 3D LCD TV market to grow to four million units in 2010. Currently, 3D TVs are being manufactured with panels procured in-house. Taiwan-based 3D LCD panel suppliers will likely compete on lower prices and may supply to brands such as Samsung and Sony in the future. Samsung has both 3D LCD and 3D PDP TVs. Sony makes use of 240Hz LED-backlit TFT LCD panels for its 3D TVs using active shutter 3D glasses. Both AU Optronics (AUO) and Chimei Innolux (CMI) have the ability to manufacture 240Hz LED-backlit LCD TV panels. LG Electronics (LGE) makes use of patterned retarder technology to generated 3D images and may enter the 3D PDP TV market using active shutter 3D glasses in the future.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20100414PR201.html">E-paper Shipments Grow 417% to Five Million Units in 2009</a></strong>: DisplaySearch reports that e-paper shipments grew 417% Y/Y to five million units in 2009, up from 950K units in 2008. The main driver was Amazon's e-book reader the 6-inch Kindle, which captured 66% share of the entire e-reader market in 2009. Hiroshi Hayase, director of small to medium size displays expects this trend to continue with large growth in shipments in the first half of 2010. I must disagree as a lot of attention has shifted from single-purpose e-book readers to multi-purpose devices like the iPad, which uses a multitouch TFT LCD panel.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/15/droid-incredible-specs-confirmed-on-verizon-site/">Verizon Wireless Droid Incredible</a></strong>: Also known as HTC Incredible. Specs include a 3.7-inch 800x480 touch OLED display, Android 2.1, 1GHz Snapdragon CPU, Sense UI, 8 megapixel camera with autofocus, GPS, 8GB of integrated memory. Coming to a store near you on April 29.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/14/macbook-pro-core-i7-review/">MacBook Pro Core i7 Review</a></strong>: The US$2,199 15.4-inch MacBook Pro's specs are a 2.66 GHz Core i7 CPU, NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M with 512MB, 4GB RAM, 500GB HDD. The i7 machine handles multiple GPU-intensive programs better than the previous Core 2 Duo versions. Turbo Boost automatically overclocks the i7 CPU when needed. Apple's automatic GPU switching is different from Optimus in its software implementation:</p>
<blockquote><p>Optimus turns on the GPU if its needed, and then runs both the Intel graphics and the discrete card simultaneously, pushing the GPU-produed imagery through the Intel chip... Apple's solution actually switches fully between the cards seamlessly, with the Intel graphics on only in a power sipping mode but not in use at all for rendering when the NVIDIA GPU is in play.</blockquote><br />
Another major difference is the Optimus solution is based on a list of apps. If one of those apps are running the discrete GPU is turned on, whether or not any graphics intensive work is being done. Apple's solution is based on need. The i7 MacBook, with a SD video rundown test with brightness set to 65%, lasted for 5 hours and 18 minutes besting Sony's VAIO Z (2.53GHz Core i5, NVIDIA GT 330M) by almost an hour. HP's Envy 15 (1.6GHz Core i7-720QM, ATI HD 4830) only lasted 2 hours.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/14/ipad-international-launch-delayed-until-the-end-of-may/"><strong>iPad International Launch Delayed to End of May</strong></a>: Originally slated for a late-April introduction, the iPad's international launch has now been pushed back to end of May. The reason may involve requiring a bit more time to ramp up production to meet demand on a worldwide basis. More than 500,000 iPads were sold in the first week in the US.</p>

Most likely Apple will be unveiling the iPhone HD. Read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/03/30/iphone-hd/">iPhone HD</a></em> for my guess at the pixel format of the next iPhone.</p>
