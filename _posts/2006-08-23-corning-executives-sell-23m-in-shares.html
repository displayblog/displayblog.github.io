<p>It always bothers me when company executives start to sell millions of dollars worth of stocks. They must know something that we don't. Or maybe it is just a coincidence they all want to get that new $5,000,000 house and a new Porsche... at the same time. CNNMoney is reporting that insiders at Corning sold almost $28 million in company stock in early August. The reason? Because they were not allowed to sell shares in April.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=corning">Corning</a> explained further that every quarter the company normally opens a window so insiders can sell their shares. Well, they didn't do that in April because Corning knew that demand for optical fiber and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-glass">glass used in LCDs</a> was softening and the information was not disclosed to the open markets at the time. When Corning did disclose that information, Wall Street responded by pounding the stock 14%.</p>
<p>So in early August, the window was opened for the insiders. And the insiders took advantage and sold their shares... $28M worth. I'm still skeptical.</p>
<p>Although Corning has a very strong position in the glass for LCD market, maybe the fiber optics market wasn't too congenial to Corning. Who knows.</p>
