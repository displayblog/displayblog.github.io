<p><a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/12/28/leica-m9">Marco Arment</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But the M9 also has slow shutter response, a slow image processor, slow shot-to-shot time, poor battery life, and a small, low-resolution screen, even by 2009&acirc;&euro;&trade;s standards.</blockquote></p>
<p>Add:</p>
<ul>
<li>"There's also no autofocus [...]"</li>
<li>"The sensor is mediocre at high ISOs [...]"</li>
<li>"The rangefinder design also hurts short-distance framing [...]"</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>The viewfinder doesn't look through the lens, and then there's the herculean price. Arment, who is clearly spoiled by the Canon 5D Mark II, concludes: "The Leica M9 is disappointing [...]." I guess that's one less thing to lust after.</p>
