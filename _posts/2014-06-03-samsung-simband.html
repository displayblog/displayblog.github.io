<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/28/5758086/samsungs-simband-hardware-and-healthcare-platform-aim-to-track-your">Josh Lowensohn, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the meantime, what Samsung referred to as an "investigational device" called the Simband, will be ground zero for tracking that information. The wrist-mounted band has a modular array of sensors on the bottom. Those sensors monitor various body activities like heart rate and oxygen levels, but could be expanded with extra hardware to track other things. In a live demo, the Simband hardware was able to show Fish's live heart rate and other vitals on a device that looked a lot like the existing Samsung Gear smartwatch</blockquote></p>
<p>A good idea. But I don't have to see all those graphs on my wrist. And older folks with less than perfect vision will be hard pressed to see such tiny fonts and data.</p>
<p>Focus on sensing and notifying, and let the larger IPS LCD or OLED displays on smartphones and tablets do the heavy lifting when it comes to showing the captured data and the results of what the servers in the cloud analyzed.</p>
