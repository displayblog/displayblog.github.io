<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/15/netflix-adds-4-9m-new-members-in-q1-sending-shares-up-more-than-10/">Alex Wilhelm, TechCrunch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The company reported that its subscriber base grew to a total 62.3 million. That figure includes 2.3 million new domestic subscribers, and 2.6 million non-domestic subscribers. Those figures represented record subscriber growth and were well above company estimates.</blockquote></p>
<p>At the end of 2014 Netflix had 57.4 million subscribers worldwide; it's now 62.3 million, up 8.5% Q/Q. Netflix's offering is compelling: for US$7.99 per month you get to watch almost 10,000 movies at any time. Add an additional $1 for HD, $4 for 4K.</p>
