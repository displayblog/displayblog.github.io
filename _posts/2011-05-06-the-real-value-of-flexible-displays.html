<p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/05/05/flexible_screen/">The Register</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The real value of flexible screens isn't in flexing them deliberately, but making them resistant to the flexing that takes place by accident in normal use. A flexible screen (and flexible electronics) will bend, not break, and there's real value there.</blockquote></p>
<p>What I want is electronic paper, a display I can use to write on and not worry about it breaking when I drop it.</p>
