<p><a href="http://www.sanyo.com/entertainment/cameracorder/index.cfm?productID=1239">Sanyo</a>: Everyone is moving toward HD. And many have been waiting a long time for an affordable HD camcorder. Sanyo's Xacti VPC-HD1 is the world's first solidstate HD camcorder and the company claims that it is the smallest and lightest HD camcorder on the market today. The VPC-HD1 captures 5MP still images and has an impressive 10x optical zoom and a maximum aperture of f3.5.</p>
<p>HD is recorded at 1280x720 pixel format and 30 fps in 16:9. All of these features are great, but let's look at the little screen that comes with it, the 2.2" OLED display should be very bright, colorful and thin. Most likely, it uses LTPS instead of a-Si with a pixel format of 176x220 and displayable colors of 262 thousand.</p>
<p>The only thing I don't like about Sanyo is the Sanyo name. One more thing: that design is just to ergonomic. I like it more like a simple rectangle.</p>
