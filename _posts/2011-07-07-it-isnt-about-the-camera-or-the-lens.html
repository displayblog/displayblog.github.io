<p>Patrick Rhone at <a href="http://minimalmac.com/post/7367856172/all-of-the-above-shots-were-taken-with-an-iphone">Minimal Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>That something, the camera in the iPhone 4, I dare say can match or best many of the compact digital cameras on the market. In the hands of the right person, I would argue that it could match or best any other photo ever taken. Why? Because it isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t about the camera, or the lens. A great photographer can take a great photo with any camera put in their hands.</blockquote></p>
<p>Rhone was reacting to the <a href="http://photojojo.com/store/awesomeness/iphone-slr-mount/">iPhone SLR Mount</a> that lets you connect Canon or Nikon lenses to your iPhone. I must say I am intrigued, but just the thought of hauling a big mess like that isn't tempting. The lack of portability was one of the main reasons why I sold my Canon 20D and 35-mm f/1.4 L lens. When I wanted to capture a moment the only camera I had most, if not all, of the time was my iPhone.</p>
<p>I started running about a month ago. Well, not <em>really</em> running: I walk half the time. If you know me you'll know that I don't like running, at all. But after having read Leo Babauta's <a href="http://zenhabits.net/">Zen Habits</a> and other minimalists who seem to be healthy and enjoying life, I've decided that the simplest way to get back into shape is to: do pushups, pull-ups, walk, and run. So I ran yesterday and took a picture, with the iPhone that was in my pocket, of course.</p>
