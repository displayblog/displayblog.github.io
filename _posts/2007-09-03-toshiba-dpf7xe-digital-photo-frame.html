<p>Everyone is getting into the digital photo frame market. But no company has provided me a compelling reason to spend my hard earned money one on. Toshiba&acirc;&euro;&trade;s entry comes close.</p>

<p>Toshiba&acirc;&euro;&trade;s DPF7XE, first of all, is very stylish, kind of B&amp;O-like with a twist of Apple juice. The 7&acirc;&euro; wide LCD has a pixel format of 800 x 480 that should provide ample pixels to show nice details in the pictures and movies from your point-and-shoot digital cameras. There are two speakers for playing back music from DivX, MP3, MPEG4 and WMA files.</p>
<p>CF, MemoryStick, MMC and SD cards are all supported via a memory card reader. The DPF7XE allows external storage units to be connected via a USB 2.0 port. Just as iTunes optimizes pictures for display on the iPod or iPhone, the DPF7XE optimizes (resizes) pictures for display on its 7&acirc;&euro; LCD and uses its built-in 256MB of RAM. There is one critical omission: no WiFi. The remote control is a bit complex and cluttered compared to Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s simple remote. And that is why my hard earned money stays in my wallet.</p>
