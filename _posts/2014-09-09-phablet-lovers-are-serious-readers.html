<p>Jarah Euston, <a href="http://www.flurry.com/blog/flurry-insights/tides-turn-phablet%E2%80%99s-popularity">Flurry</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>After examining the most popular categories of apps, we can report that there is not one &acirc;&euro;&oelig;killer category&acirc;&euro;¬ù that captivates Phablet users. In fact, they behave a lot like consumers on smaller devices, with gaming, social and entertainment as the leading app categories. Interestingly, books is the category in which Phablet users over-index the most. 10% of total time spent in books on all devices comes from Phablets, up from 3% in 2013. Remember, Phablets only account for 6% of the installed base, so the fact that they account for 10% of total time spent in books means Phablet lovers are serious readers.</blockquote></p>
