<p>Ulvac Taiwan Manufacturing (UTMC) and Ultra Clean Precision Technologies (UCPT) are both part of Ulvac, a Japan-based equipment manufacturer. UTMC and UCPT announced on February 8 that their LCD equipment operations commenced. Ulvac decided to expand its investment in Taiwan at the Tainan Science Park by setting up a flat panel display (FPD) equipment manufacturing facility and a customer service base. Ulvac began investing its investments in Taiwan in the third quarter of 2006. UMTC will focus on manufacturing FPD equipment for large-area LCD displays and will import the technology from Japan. On the other hand, UCPT will focus on customer service such as equipment maintenance. Even though LCD manufacturers are slowing their investments toward increasing manufacturing capacities, Ulvac has decided to enter the Taiwan market and increase its investments there.</p>
