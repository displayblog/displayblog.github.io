<p>Taiwan-based LCD manufacturers are reporting that volume production of 240Hz LCD panels will slowly commence in the second half of 2010 according to <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20100623PD211.html">DIGITIMES</a>. Some expect 240Hz LCD panels combined with active shutter glasses to become the standard for 3D. Although there has been a lot of excitement regarding 3D but there are concerns as to whether demand for 3D TV will actually materialize. Samsung is betting big on 3D TV with plans to ship 2.6 million units in 2010. Sony is quite optimistic too with a goal of 2.2 million. Panasonic expects to ship 1.1 million while LG is forecasting one million units.</p>
