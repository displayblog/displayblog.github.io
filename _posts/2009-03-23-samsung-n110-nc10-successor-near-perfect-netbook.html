<p><img class="size-full wp-image-4755 aligncenter" title="samsung_nc110_netbook" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/samsung_nc110_netbook.jpg" alt="samsung_nc110_netbook" width="480" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.laptopmag.com/review/laptops/samsung-n-110.aspx">Laptop</a>: Want the closest thing to a perfect netbook? Laptop reviewed the N110 and stated that, "Samsung has created a near-perfect netbook in its N110." High praise. So what did Laptop like?</p>
<p>The ergonomics on the N110 improved over an already decent NC10. The touchpad improved: it was extended from 2.3 x 1.1" to 2.5 x 1.3" and makes it quite a bit more usable. Battery life improved to about 8 hours. Great keyboard: 95% full-size with nice tactile feedback and a full-size right Shift key under the Enter key (I would really like all keyboards to be like this!).</p>
<p>The display remains the same at 10.2" with a 1024x600 pixel format. If you are one of the few who would rather have the NC10, <a href="www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001I45T9O?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=displ0f-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B001I45T9O">Amazon has it for a tiny bit less at $425.98</a>.</p>
