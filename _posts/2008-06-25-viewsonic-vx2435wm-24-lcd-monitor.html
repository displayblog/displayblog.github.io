<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=viewsonic">Viewsonic</a>'s VX2435wm is targeted at folks who like to use their <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-monitor">LCD monitor</a>s for work as well as entertainment. Look at the plethora of connections on the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=24"">24"</a> LCD monitor and you can see Viewsonic is serious about targeting this market segment: there are five video inputs. This is similar to what <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dell">Dell</a> has been doing with its UltraSharp LCD monitors. You can easily connect a PlayStation 3 via the HDMI port, a PC via the VGA port and other video players such as a Nintendo Wii via one of the rest.</p>
<p>The 1000:1 contrast ratio isn't too shabby but it could be better. The 500 cd/m2 of brightness is at the top end of the spectrum and most likely you'll need to dial down the brightness a bit if you don't want to fry your eyes. The GTG response times of 8ms is fairly standard, but if you're a hardcore gamer, you'd want something a bit faster. But all in all the VX2435wm has some very decent specs and should satisfy most.</p>
