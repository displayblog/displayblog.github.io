<p>David Pogue, <a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/testing-videos-on-cellphones-with-flash/?ref=personaltechemail&nl=technology&emc=cta2">The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over all, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s much better to have Flash than not to have it. O.K., it may accelerate battery drain, and mouse/keyboard games are clumsy, and it doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t work on absolutely all sites. Even so, shouldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t it be available for us to use now and then when we need it?</blockquote></p>
<p>I uninstalled Flash from Safari on my MacBook Pro and ever since my blogging experience has been slowdown-free, but I do have to switch over to Opera (with Flash) to watch the occasional Flash video, which slows Opera down to a crawl. I almost always quit Opera once I am finished watching. Interestingly, when I see the 'HTML5' logo on YouTube and Vimeo videos I feel a sense of relief. I don't exactly know why, but maybe its because I've been liberated from having to experience Flash on Opera.</p>
<p>There are two exceptions: I do watch Glee and Lie To Me on Hulu using Opera.</p>
