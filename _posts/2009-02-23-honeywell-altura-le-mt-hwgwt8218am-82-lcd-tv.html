  No. That would be Soyo. Yes, Soyo is the company that builds motherboards and some
  low-end LCD monitors. And Soyo will be building the Honeywell-badged Altura LE line
  of LCD TVs. The largest of the Altura LE line is the MT-HWGWT8218AM. What a mouthfull.
  Who makes these ridiculous model numbers?\r\n\r\nThe largest Altura LE is 82\".
  Pretty large. But instead of the ultra-high definition 4K2K or Quad Full HD pixel
  formats you might expect from such a huge LCD, you get a paltry 1920 x 1080. 1920
  x 1080 isn't bad; it is standard if you want to watch 1080p content from your Blu-ray
  disk. If you don't want to see the actual pixels, you'll need to sit back quite
  a ways. The 120,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio isn't shabby but Honeywell (or Soyo)
  seems to be aiming high with the Altura line. For a high-end unit the dynamic contrast
  ratio is quite low and to some extent moot since the 82\" doesn't have a LED backlight.
  With a regular CCFL backlight the modulating will be on a 'global' basis meaning
  that all the CCFL tubes will be brightened or dimmed together depending on the video
  content. Soyo: next time think LED backlight if going high-end.\r\n\r\n"

<p>Honeywell. No. That would be Soyo. Yes, Soyo is the company that builds motherboards and some low-end LCD monitors. And Soyo will be building the Honeywell-badged Altura LE line of LCD TVs.

<p>The largest Altura LE is 82". Pretty large. But instead of the ultra-high definition 4K2K or Quad Full HD pixel formats you might expect from such a huge LCD, you get a paltry 1920 x 1080. 1920 x 1080 isn't bad; it is standard if you want to watch 1080p content from your Blu-ray disk.

<p>The brightness at 600 cd/m2 is bright enough and the 178/178 viewing angles are as good as they get. The Honeywell 82" comes with both NTSC and ATSC tuners. Now there are just three HDMI connections. I'm sure size wasn't the limiting factor. So where is the fourth or fifth? VGA but no DVI? Just two component inputs and a single composite connection? More connections please. With LCD TVs getting to be ultra-thin at around 1" this behemoth is not slim at all: 17.9" thick! Wow. I hope that's with the stand. But even without the stand I'm sure it'll be fairly thick. At 303lbs you'll definitely need to reinforce your walls before hanging this one on the wall.</p>
<p>Honeywell's 82" Altura LE LCD TV is, in a word, "Huh?" The size is high-end but the specifications are not. No LED backlight. No local dimming. Not enough ports for the size. Just your regular 1920 x 1080 pixel format you can find on a 22" LCD. The brand is a no-brand. I would trust IBM to build a better TV than Soyo or Honeywell. And the timing is perfectly terrible: consumers are maximizing their every dollar and when it comes to TVs a brand will need to provide better value than Samsung, Sony at the high-end and Vizio everywhere else to win. I don't want to sound too pessimistic but Honeywell isn't off to a great start with this one.</p>
