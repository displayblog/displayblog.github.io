<p><a href="http://www.asymco.com/2013/02/27/the-new-tele-vision/">Horace Dediu</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As long as LG sells TVs as content terminals they might not obtain much value from webOS. If, on the other hand, LG were to use webOS to re-define their televisions to be something else entirely, namely software execution devices, sold differently and hired to do a different job than a TV, then webOS becomes not only necessary but potentially a source of great prosperity.</blockquote></p>
<p>Great insight. Let's hope LG does something exciting with webOS and not just another jazzed up content terminal.</p>
