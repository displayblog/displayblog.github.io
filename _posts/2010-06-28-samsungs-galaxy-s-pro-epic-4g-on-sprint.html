Sprint has its second 4G smartphone, Samsung's Epic 4G. The Epic 4G is a rebranding of the Samsung Galaxy S Pro that is different from the non-Pro in that it sports a slide-out QWERTY keyboard. The Android 2.1 smartphone sports <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?s=samsung+mobile+display">Samsung Mobile Display</a>'s (SMD) 4-inch <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?s=%22super+amoled%22">Super AMOLED</a> display, a Hummingbird CPU running at 1GHz, a 5 megapixel camera on the back and a 640x480 front-facing camera, 720p video capture, and WiFi BGN. Like the HTC EVO 4G the Epic 4G has mobile hotspot capability, which you will need to pay through the nose (an additional US$10/mo) on top of the $79.99/mo you'll be paying for 3G/4G service that includes 450 anytime minutes. One interesting feature of the Epic 4G is DLNA connectivity but loses the HDMI connection.</p>
<p>There is a Sprint-made table on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/28/sprint-lines-up-epic-4g-against-the-competition-likes-its-chanc/">Engadget</a> comparing the Epic 4G and HTC EVO 4G to its main competitors: AT&amp;T Apple <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?s=%22iphone+4%22">iPhone 4</a>, Verizon HTC Incredible and Motorola <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?s=%22droid+x%22">Droid X</a>. The Epic 4G is coming in the coming months. The Epic 4G page at <a href="http://now.sprint.com/epic4g/?ECID=vanity:epic4g">Sprint</a>.</p>
