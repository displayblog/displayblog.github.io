<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2011/12/bilton-faa/">Ben Brooks</a>. <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/25/disruptions-tests-cast-doubt-on-fcc-rules-on-kindle-and-ipad-html">Nick Bilton, The New York Times</a>:</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The F.A.A. requires that before a plane can be approved as safe, it must be able to withstand up to 100 volts per meter of electrical interference.</p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>The Kindle emits 30 microvolts, or 0.00003 volts, per meter. But how about a hundred Kindles? EMT Labs testing manager Kevin Bothmann answers that question:</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Electromagnetic energy doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t add up like that. Five Kindles will not put off five times the energy that one Kindle would.</p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>Even if it did linearly add up, to get to 100 volts per meter from Kindle electrical interference a 365 passenger Boeing 777-300ER will need 3.3 million Kindles. Or over 9000 Kindles per passenger.</p></p>

<p>The F.A.A. and other groups seem to be running out of reasons we can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t use digital e-readers on planes during takeoff and landing. Maybe their next response will be: &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Because I said so!&acirc;&euro;¬ù</p><br />
