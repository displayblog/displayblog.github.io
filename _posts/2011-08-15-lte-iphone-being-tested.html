<p>Jonathan Geller, <a href="http://www.bgr.com/2011/08/15/exclusive-4g-lte-iphone-currently-in-carrier-testing/">BGR</a>:</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>While we can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t confirm that the upcoming fifth-generation iPhone will be able to support 4G LTE, we can now exclusively confirm that Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s carrier partners are testing iPhone models with LTE capability.</p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>The questions Apple is trying to answer with a LTE-capable iPhone prototype:</p></p>
<ul>
<li>Does the battery last long enough?</li>
<li>Is LTE available for the vast majority of potential iPhone customers?</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>We can look at other LTE smartphones to get some indications on how long the battery lasts. According to <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/4450/lg-revolution/5">AnandTech</a>, LTE web browsing battery life in hours:</p></p>
<ul>
<li>LG Revolution: 3.53</li>
<li>HTC Thunderbolt: 2.87</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>These are two smartphones that work on Verizon's LTE network. The iPhone 4 lasts 7.67 hours on Verizon's CDMA network and 6.65 hours on AT&amp;T's GSM. The other knock on LTE is availability: Verizon expects its LTE network to cover its 3G network by the end of 2013. AT&amp;T is at least a year behind Verizon.</p></p>
