<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/01/23/battelle">John Gruber</a>. This is what <a href="https://www.focusontheuser.org/">the "don't be evil" bookmarklet</a> does:</p>
<blockquote><p>It looks at the three places where Google only shows Google+ results and then automatically googles Google to see if Google finds a result more relevant than Google+.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://searchengineland.com/dont-be-evil-tool-google-108971">Danny Sullivan thoroughly explains how it works</a>. And <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/2012/01/facebook-to-google-dont-be-evil-focus-on-the-user.php">John Battelle explains the motivation behind it</a>. I have been diligently working at switching away from all Google services, and this was the motivation I needed to complete my switch away Google.</p>
<ul>
<li>On August 08, 2011 <a href="/2011/08/08/google-adeu/">I stopped using Google Reader</a>.<br />
</li>
<li>On August 09, 2011 <a href="/2011/08/09/moving-away-from-google-feedburner/">I stopped using Google Feedburner</a>.</li></p>
<li>On August 10, 2011 <a href="/2011/08/10/google-adeu-off-of-google-analytics/">I stopped using Google Analytics</a>.</li>
<li>On August 12, 2011 <a href="/2011/08/12/google-adeu-bye-bye-google-docs/">I stopped using Google Docs</a>.</li><br />
</ul><br />
I have been forwarding emails sent to my gmail.com address to my @me.com address. Eventually I will be able to shut down my gmail.com address. The last holdout has been searching on Google. I initially tried Bing, but I have continued to use Google to search assuming it returned the most relevant results, but ever since hearing of Google's uncompetitive behavior I am giving Bing another go. <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/01/duckduckwin/">Ben Brooks is suggesting DuckDuckGo</a>.</p>
