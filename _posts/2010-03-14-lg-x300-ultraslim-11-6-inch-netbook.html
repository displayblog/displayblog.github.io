LG's X300 is a 11.6-inch notebook PC that is just 17.5-mm (0.69 inch) thick. Weight is just 970g (2.13 pounds). The X300 is powered by a 2GHz Intel Menlow CPU, 2GB RAM and a 128GB SSD but sports a fan-less design. Other specs include: 1.3MP webcam and an embedded 3G (GSM, GPRS, EDGE, UMTS, HSDPA) modem chipset. The ultraslim netbook comes in two colors: pearl white and light brown. There is a "hidden touchpad" that shows itself when you touch it. I'm not sure if you want a touchpad to be hidden but LG touts it as part of the X300 slim and high-tech design. I'm currently in Korea and the ad (above) for the X300 is being aggressively promoted by LG. I wonder if you can really stick the X300 on a window with just a little piece of scotch tape...
