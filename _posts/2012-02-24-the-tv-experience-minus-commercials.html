<blockquote><p>I turn to that, Beatrix approves, and we watch. Then, a few minutes later, a commercial comes on. The volume difference is jarring to say the least. I would safely guess it is fifty percent louder than the show. I hurriedly reach for the remote and turn it down&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Why did you turn the movie off, Daddy?&acirc;&euro;, Beatrix worriedly asks, as if she has done something is wrong and is being punished by having her entertainment interrupted. She thinks that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s what I was doing by rushing for the remote.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;I didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t turn it off, honey. This is just a commercial. I was turning the volume down because it was so loud. Shreck will come back on in a few minutes&acirc;&euro; I say.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Did it break?&acirc;&euro;, she asks. It does sometimes happen at home that Flash or Silverlight implode, interrupt her show, and I have to fix it.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;No. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s just a commercial.&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;What&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a commercial?&acirc;&euro;, she asks.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;It is like little shows where they tell you about other shows and toys and snacks.&acirc;&euro;, I explain.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Why?&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>Why indeed.</p>
