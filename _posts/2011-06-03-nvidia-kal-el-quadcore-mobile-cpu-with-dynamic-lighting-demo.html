<p>To imagine a game like this with dynamic lighting on a tablet is impressive. On the other hand, the fact that dynamic lighting requires a quad-core CPU is not. Couldn't there be a more efficient, simple, and elegant method for dynamic lighting that does not require so much CPU horsepower? And I wonder how long the batteries will last on a tablet with the NVIDIA Kal-El CPU. Probably not that long.</p>
