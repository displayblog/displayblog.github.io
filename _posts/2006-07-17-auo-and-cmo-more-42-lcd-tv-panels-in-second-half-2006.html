<p>AUO will start making 42" LCD TV panels at its new G7 plant starting from October and continue to make 42" panels from its G6 plant. CMO will use its G5 plant to manufacture 42" panels. AUO's 42" will be Full HD (1080p) with a 1200:1 contrast ratio, 550 nits of brightness and a color gamut of 72% NTSC. CMO's 42" will also be Full HD, have a 1200: 1 contrast ratio, 500 nits, but have a higher color gamut of 90% NTSC, with a fast 3.6ms response time.</p>
<p>The 40" vs. 42" competition will heat up as LG.Philips LCD, AUO and CMO counter against S-LCD (Samsung and Sony's joint venture). Prices for 42" has already hit a very attractive $1799 at CostCo for a Philips-branded LCD TV but with only a 1366 x 768 resolution.</p>
