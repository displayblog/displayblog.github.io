<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/30/intel-reveals-skinny-ivy-bridge-ultrabooks-moores-law-defyin/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Intel exec declared that new class of PC, dubbed "Ultrabooks," will make up 40-percent of the market by the end of 2012. These machines, powered by the 22nm Ivy Bridge, will be less than 0.8-inches thick and start at under $1,000 -- which sounds just like the lines we were fed about CULV chips back in 2009.</blockquote></p>
<p>So let me get this straight. Are ultrabooks positioned between netbooks and ultraportable notebooks? So ultraBooks will compete against higher-end tablets, like the 32GB or 64GB iPads in both WiFi-only or 3G flavors? The lowest-end 11.6-inch MacBook starts at $999, and it's a full-blown notebook.</p>
<p>I don't think Intel's ultrabook, as a new category of portable computers, will be successful. To me, it looks like ultrabooks will just turn out to be expensive netbooks, a category that has been squeezed by smartphones and tablets. On the other hand, I could see Chromeultrabooks: ultrabooks running Google's Chrome OS.</p>
<p>Wouldn't that be interesting. Microsoft ditches Intel exclusivity for its next Windows release while Google courts Intel to topple the Windows hegemony with Chrome OS and Chromebooks.</p>
