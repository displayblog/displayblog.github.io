<p>[ <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/02/08/cbs-says-super-bowl-50-broke-streaming-records-with-3-96-million-viewers/">TechCrunch</a> ] Sarah Perez:</p>
<blockquote><p>CBS reported earlier this morning that its live stream of Super Bowl 50 broke all prior streaming records for the big game. Now the network has released numbers to back up that claim: according to <a href="http://www.cbspressexpress.com/cbs-sports/releases/view?id=44573">an announcement</a> released this afternoon, 3.96 million unique viewers tuned in to watch the Broncos versus the Panthers across laptops, desktops, tablets, connected TV devices and mobile phones.</blockquote></p>
<p>Streaming is in.</p>
