<p>Brian Klug, <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6415/windows-phone-8-and-htc-8x-preview">AnandTech</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Superficially Windows Phone 8 is very similar to Windows Phone 7.5 and 7 that came before it, but what&acirc;&euro;&trade;s different under the hood is dramatic. The move away from the Windows CE kernel and onto the same NT kernel as Windows 8 and RT run will have far reaching implications for the platform that won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be immediately visible to users, but is nonetheless the core of what&acirc;&euro;&trade;s new in Windows Phone 8 [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>Genuinely excited, and this is a proven strategy. NT : WP8 = OS X : iOS</p>
