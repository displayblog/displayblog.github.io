<p>On February 25, The Nikkei reported that Sony plans to invest JPY100B (US$926M) in Sharp's Gen. 10 TFT LCD plant. Sony is expected to have a news conference later on Tuesday. Sony has had experience in investing in LCD fabs to secure panel supply. With Samsung, Sony invested 50% of the cost of a Gen. 7 fab and called it S-LCD. Sony was able to procure 50% of all S-LCD output for use in its LCD TVs.</p>
<p>
This is a natural step for Sony as its LCD TV business grows. Establishing two sources for LCD TVs allows Sony more negotiation power over price and a consistent supply.<br />
