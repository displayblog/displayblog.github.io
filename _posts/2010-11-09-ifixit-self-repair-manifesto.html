<p>Here are the five critical truths to iFixit's Self-Repair Manifesto:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repair is better than recycling: Making our things last longer is both more efficient and more cost-effective than mining them for raw materials.</li>
<li>Repair saves the planet: Earth has limited resources and we can't run a linear manufacturing process forever. The best way to be efficient is to reuse what we already have.</li>
<li>Repair saves you money: Fixing things is often free, and usually cheaper than replacing them. Doing the repair yourself saves serious dough.</li>
<li>Repair teaches engineering: The best way to find out how something works is to take it apart!</li>
<li>If you can't fix it, you don't own it: Repair connects people and devices, creating bonds that transcend consumption. Self-repair is sustainable.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>I agree. Except that part about saving money. I try to purchase stuff that will last and usually they cost a lot. When I have judgment lapses sometimes I come home with whatever was the absolute cheapest. And regret it soon afterwards when it breaks. These cheapo gadgets are almost always cheaper to throw away than to fix. But the trick is to never buy them in the first place.</p>
<p>I have a late-2009 17-inch MacBook Pro and when Apple came out with Snow Leopard that was an optimized version of Leopard I was ecstatic! I didn't have to worry about whether or not my hardware could run the latest OS; it would run it even faster. I hope Apple does it again with Lion so I am not forced to upgrade to a faster machine. What I would like to do is upgrade my hard drive to SSD if the need arises. I hope to keep my MacBook for a very long time and I also hope Apple will help me do that by continuing to optimize OS X while adding features that help to get work done and have fun.</p>

<p>I have an ancient Sony Walkman (model number: WM-F102) that I would like to get repaired. The radio works intermittently but the cassette driving mechanism doesn't at all. As you can see it is in beautiful physical shape. I also have a Casio MG-777 game calculator from many years ago. I have fond memories of both and would like to get them fixed. Anybody know anyone who can help? If there is someone who can restore these two electronic gadgets to original condition I intend to chronicle the repair process and post it. I don't think self-repair is an option, unfortunately.</p>
