I have always preferred LCD monitors that use In-Plane Switching (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=ips">IPS</a>) panels. A display's primary function, in my opinion, is to accurately display information, may that be text, graphics or video. For graphics color is very important. IPS panels are known to have little color shift as you go off-angle leading to great color reproduction. That is why almost all of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=apple">Apple</a>'s LCD monitors use IPS panels. And that is one of the reasons why I like <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lg">LG</a>'s L246WP-BN.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1200</a> pixel format is great for displaying high-resolution pictures and having two windows of 960 x 1200 side-by-side. I like using the  "Tiles Windows Vertically" feature in Windows quite a bit, and that is how I am blogging right now. I have the Wordpress window on the left and the LG product page in the right window. Oh, I'm not using the LG monitor for this, yet. I have a 17" <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dell">Dell</a> Inspiron 9300 with 1920 x 1200 pixels. The fonts can be on the small side for some, but the added productivity outweighed the smaller fonts and icons when I was making the purchasing decision about 2 1/2 years ago.</p>
<p>I was surprised to see the 1000:1 contrast ratio. LG.Philips LCD (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lpl">LPL</a>) generally makes excellent IPS panels, but contrast ratios have generally lagged behind Vertically Aligned (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=va">VA</a>) panels from Samsung or AU Optronics (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=auo">AUO</a>). I guess they have been making advances in IPS panels: making blacks more black or whites more white. Another interesting choice was the HDMI in lieu of DVI port. Most IT-targeted LCD monitors will sport a VGA + DVI combo, but LG's L246WP-BN has a VGA + <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=hdmi">HDMI</a> combo. My guess is that LG was hoping to capture the wallets of consumers looking more toward consumer electronics (CE) applications. CE applications like the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Blu-ray and HD-DVD players have HDMI out, but not DVI (some have both). So if you wanted to play some games with your <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=%22playstation+3%22">PS3</a> or <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=%22xbox+360%22">Xbox 360</a> with 1080 lines, then this would be a good monitor to do it with. But, one caveat: the response time is only 8ms. This is on the slow side as some brands, namely Acer, have come out with really fast response times. Motion blur is the blur effect you see when things move about quickly especially when you watching sports. LCD TVs without <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=120hz">120Hz</a> or black frame insertion technologies will experience quite a bit of motion blur since most of the time they are displaying moving pictures. Of course, this 24" beaut will be used for both work and play. Just don't expect CRT-like fast and crisp movements when watching sports on ESPN HD if you happen to connect your STB via HDMI.</p>
<p>The $650 price can be a bit much and I was quite surprised when I came across Best Buy's sale. BB regularly has LG's 24" for $599.99. But, BB was having the L246WP-BN for just $450! <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=8267724&amp;type=product&amp;id=1170290207389&amp;DCMP=KNC-TLC&amp;ref=30&amp;loc=KW-1305">BB's online store</a> stated that it was sold out, and as of Dec. 22 9:19am PST, it still is. I went by the BB store in Santana Row (a popular hang out place with lots of name brand shops and places to eat in San Jose, CA) yesterday but they were completely out of stock. But the good news was that I was able to have a look at inventory for LG's L246WP-BN for all the stores in Northern California. Unfortunately, all San Francisco Bay Area BB stores were out of stock. But, I was in luck. I saw 4 units for a BB in Salinas. And I have a dear relative who lives there! To make a long story short (it's already long enough!), I'll be staring at a 24" IPS-based LCD monitor tomorrow afternoon!</p>

<p><i>Update Christmas Day 2007</i></p>
<p>I received my L246WP-BN yesterday. I am using it to post this blog. Just to make sure I had a perfect display, I used Dead Pixel Buddy (I downloaded it from <a href="http://www.freewarefiles.com/program_9_91_17976.html">FreewareFiles.com</a>) to test my very large LCD monitor. The LG IPS panel turned out to be perfect without a pixel defect or a sub-pixel defect. Yay! Compared to my 17" TN LCD in the Dell Inspiron 9300... actually I can't compare: The IPS display can be seen, without hardly any color shift, from side to side. I am very happy with the display performance so far. The only challenge that I am having is using the DVI-HDMI cable. I am currently running 1920 x 1200 via the VGA cable as I have had trouble using the HDMI connection. Anyone know what I must do? I have googled the problem but did not find a solution. Let me know if you know. And Merry Christmas!</p>
<p><i>Update 2007.12.29</i></p>
<p>I think I have found the solution! My L246WP-BN is being driving via the DVI-HDMI connection right now. Compared to the VGA connection, text is so much more crisp! Ah. Finally! This is what I did:</p>
<p>1. Connect the DVI-HDMI cable. Use the OSD on the LG and set the input to HDMI. Promptly, the LG monitor will go to sleep mode.<br />
2. Enter display settings and make sure to set it so it is using the LG display as either duplicated or extended (I use extended).<br />
3. Reboot PC. I have Windows XP Pro SP2.<br />
4. The connection simply works when Windows boots up.</p>
<p>I am simply ecstatic! I can't say how much I am relieved. I hope all of you out there that have a L246WP-BN can get the HDMI-DVI connection to work. Happy New Year everyone!</p>
