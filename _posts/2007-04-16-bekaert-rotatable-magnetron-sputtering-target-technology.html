<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Bekaert</strong>, a Belgium-based metal transformation and coating technologies company, has developed rotatable magnetron sputtering target technology that lowers cost of ownership through longer production runs, faster coating deposition and a more complete use of coating material. Bekaert&acirc;&euro;&trade;s technology can be applied toward architectural and automotive glass, display glass and photovoltaic glass that require a coating process.</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>Sn-Sputter Targets:</em> Standard thermal sprayed Sn targets have 90% of theoretical density and 2000 ppm oxygen content. Advanced thermal spray technology reaches 99% of theoretical density and just 250 ppm oxygen content. Performance is improved in arc rate, burn-in behavior, deposition rate and I-V grain morphology, grain orientation, and material density.</p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em>Thermal spray technology:</em> Specific coatings for specific applications are possible due to manufacturability of doped materials in both stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric compositions. Almost all materials can be sprayed while long-life targets up to 152&acirc;&euro;¬ù can be produced easily.</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>TiOx Targets:</em> High temperature process allows ceramic Ti-oxide to melt while Ti-oxide is partially reduced transforming it to an electrical conductive phase. Ti-oxide remains conductive at room temperature due to high cooling rates. Ti-oxide targets have higher process stability in reactive processes compared to pure metal Ti targets. PEM-like process control systems are not required and sputter deposition speeds can be improved.</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>Si(Al) Targets:</em> Inherently flexible target geometry allows multiple sizes and maximizes sputter capacity with target layer thickness up to 9-13mm.</p></p>
