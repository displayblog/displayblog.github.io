<p>Researchers at the University of Michigan claim they can beat the resolution (pixel density as in PPI) of Apple's Retina Display by an order of magnitude. How? With plasmonic nanophotonics. They'll need to change that name if they want any chance of succeeding in the market place. How does this work?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/08/better-than-retina-the-next-big-display-technology/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+GearFactor+%28Blog+-+Gadget+Lab+%28Gear+Factor%29%29">Wired</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Vary the spacing between the grates, and white light appears in different colors. Instead of the multiple layers of glass, metal polarizers, and filter sheets in a conventional LCD, the polarizer is the color filter. The whole color component of the screen is a three-layer all-metal dielectric stack.</blockquote></p>
<p>What's it great for? High resolution, low power consumption, flexible displays, etc. The whole display is made up of just three metal dielectric layers. Very cool technology but my question is: when can I have a state-of-the-art smartphone with this plasmonic nanophotonics display technology for $199 with a new two-year agreement?</p>
