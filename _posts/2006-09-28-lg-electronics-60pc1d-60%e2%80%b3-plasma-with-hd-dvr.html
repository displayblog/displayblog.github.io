<p>I wish I was at CEDIA. There&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a lot of really great technology and designs displayed there. LG Electronics (LGE) showed its 60&acirc;&euro;&sup3; plasma display panel (PDP) TV with an integrated HD-DVR (not your SD types), the 60PC1D. The HD-DVR has a 160GB, which translates into 13 hours of HD content or 63 hours of SD content. The PDP itself has a 7000:1 contrast ratio (or in <a href="http://www.audiotronic.ca/eSection/electrProd.asp?send=eng&amp;codFab=LG&amp;codPrd=60PC1D&amp;choix=SPEC">other sources</a> stated at 10000:1), a brightness of 1200 cd/m2, 60000 hours lifetime, 160+ degree viewing angles, and a 1366 x 768 pixel format resolution. The 60PC1D has two HDMI ports, integrated tuners (ATSC, NTSC, QAM). MSRP is $5399, but there are places that are selling for much less.</p>
<p>The 60PC1D uses LGE&acirc;&euro;&trade;s XD Engine to improve the video images by upscaling lower resolution content to almost HD levels. In general, the XD Engine enhances the brightness, contrast, detail and color of the video source.</p>

<p>HD-DVR, that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s what we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve been waiting for! Why would CE companies pair a nice HDTV with a SD-DVR? That was just non-sense to me. LGE is on the right track by pairing HD with HD. The only qualm I have with the 60&acirc;&euro;&sup3; 60PC1D is the resolution. 1366 x 768? Can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t we get to 1920 x 1080 resolution at these very large sizes?</p>
