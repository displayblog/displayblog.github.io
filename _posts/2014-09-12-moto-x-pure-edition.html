<p>Chris Ziegler, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/12/6139945/motorolas-unlocked-unbranded-moto-x-will-be-called-the-pure-edition">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[...] its direct-sale, unbranded, unlocked Moto X will be called the Moto X Pure Edition when it ships. (The Moto X doesn't actually use stock Android, per se, but it's awfully close with a few tweaks &mdash; and the Pure Edition lacks the crapware and slower OS update schedule of the carrier-branded units.)</blockquote></p>
<p>A more accurate name would have been: Moto X Almost Pure Edition. An example of marketing folks complicating things with meaningless slogans; why not simply bring out a Moto X Google Play Edition?</p>
