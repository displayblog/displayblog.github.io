<p>Founder and lead developer of CyanogenMod, Steve Kondik, has left Samsung Mobile after 19 months working as a software engineer. Here's <a href="https://plus.google.com/100275307499530023476/posts/U9KhibuYFcj">what Kondik had to say about TouchWiz on Google+</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>TouchWiz has become a bit more consistent with the latest upgrade. There are no more jarring mismatches in different parts of the OS, and it's been lightened up a bit and has a clean "flat" feel. Unfortunately, it feels like it has been sent a few years back in time to the Froyo days. Say goodbye to all of the nice touch-friendly ViewPagers and say hello again to a fully tabbed UI. You'll also enjoy the seemingly endless onslaught of popup windows and modal "Loading..." dialogs. UI performance is average. It's better and worse at the same time, depending on your viewpoint I suppose.</blockquote></p>
<p>Flat good; tabbed UI, endless popup windows, and modal dialogs bad. Kondik likes the hardware though: "Specwise, this device blows the competition out of the water."</p>
