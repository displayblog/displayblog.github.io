<blockquote><p>Milo has established relationships with both local and national retail locations and brings you the most up-to-date inventory, sale and pricing information available. Search for an item in Milo, and you will find every store in your area that carries it, how much it costs at each location, and consumer reviews to help you decide if the product is right for you.</blockquote></p>
<p>You've got today and tomorrow. That's it. Don't waste time aimlessly wondering through shopping malls, though that can be fun at times. Use tools like Milo Local Shopping to get in, get what you need, and get going onto the next item.</p>
