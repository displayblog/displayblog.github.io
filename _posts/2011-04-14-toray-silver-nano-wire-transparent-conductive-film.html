<p><a href="http://www.toray.com/news/film/nr110408.html">Toray</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Toray Advanced Film Co., Ltd. today announced that it has succeeded in developing a silver nano-wire based transparent conductive film with the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s best transparency and conductivity - light transmittance of 90% or above and surface resistivity, which is a measure of conductivity, between 150 and 250 &Icirc;&copy;/sq - using wet coating method. The material also boasts superior flexibility, natural coloration, durability and workability, and the Company expects to begin its mass production in the near future.</blockquote></p>
<p>A flexible, transparent, conductive film like the silver nano-wire film Toray announced enables flexible displays. In light of the recently announced A4-sized <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/04/13/bridgestone-aerobee-a4-color-e-ink-tablet-with-touch/">Bridgestone AeroBee</a> that sports color E Ink and touch, the video on how E Ink's Triton Imaging Films work, and now Toray's transparent conductive film, we are not too far from a commercially viable replacement for real paper. A simple google search led me to a <a href="http://youtu.be/VO63-iYNAFo">YouTube video with a flexible E Ink prototype</a>, from June 2010. So we really can't be too far off. This also reminded me of <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/18936930">3M's Patterned Transparent Conductors</a> shown to me during CES 2011. </p>
