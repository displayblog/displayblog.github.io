<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-4324 aligncenter" title="apple_2009_24_imac1" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/apple_2009_24_imac1.jpg" alt="apple_2009_24_imac1" width="500" height="333" /></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That was quick. The folks over at Engadget posted up some unboxing pictures of the 2009 <a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250:utpr0mvi0e9&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=24"+imac&amp;sa=Search">24" iMac</a> that just got released. The 24" iMac is the 2.93GHz version (the second fastest after the 3.06GHz). The 2.93GHz version will set you back at least $1799.00. Good design costs good money. As you can see from the nice photograph above, the iMac with its aluminum enclosure and the edge-to-edge front glass is a beautiful sight. Hop on over to Engadget for the rest of the pictures.</p></p>
