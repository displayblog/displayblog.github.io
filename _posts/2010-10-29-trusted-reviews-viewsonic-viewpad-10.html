<p><a href="http://www.trustedreviews.com/laptops/review/2010/10/29/ViewSonic-ViewPad-10/p2">Trusted Reviews</a> on the ViewSonic ViewPad 10:</p>
<blockquote><p>Where the ViewPad 10 &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; and indeed the vast majority of other tablets &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; really can't compare with the iPad is in screen quality. Rather than the latter's IPS panel, with its excellent viewing angles and great contrast, here we're back to good old TN. This manifests itself in relatively poor viewing angles lesser contrast and colour. That said, from the right angle, it's still quite nice to use.</blockquote></p>
<p>Good old TN? I'm afraid there is little good about TN but maybe the low price. If ViewSonic really wants to compete in the tablet market it will need to realize one very important fact: the display makes the tablet.</p>
