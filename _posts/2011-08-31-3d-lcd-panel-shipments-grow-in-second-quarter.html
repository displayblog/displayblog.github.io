<p><a href="http://www.displaysearch.com/cps/rde/xchg/displaysearch/hs.xsl/110829_3d_lcd_tv_panels_increase_by_124_percent_quarter_over_quarter_in_q2_11.asp">DisplaySearch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Shipments of 3D-capable large-area TFT LCD panels increased to 5.2 million units in Q2, growing by 124% Q/Q. Shipments of 3D panels were primarily for LCD TVs, reaching 4.9 million units in Q2&acirc;&euro;&trade;11, 118% Q/Q growth, and pushing the 3D penetration in LCD TV panels from 4.5% in Q1&acirc;&euro;&trade;11 to 9.3% in Q2&acirc;&euro;&trade;11.</blockquote></p>
<p>Note these are 3D LCD <em>panels</em> shipping into the supply channel. The question then becomes: is the increase in 3D LCD panel shipments the result of end user market demand for 3D TVs? Or it is simply a supply side push based on wishful thinking? I'm betting it's the later.</p>
