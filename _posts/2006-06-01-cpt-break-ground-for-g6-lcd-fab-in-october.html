<p>CPT began renting 40-hectares in the Houli Base of the Central Taiwan Science Park (CTSP). The company will break ground for its G6 LCD fab in October 2006. CTSP took back 12 hectares from the original 52 because CTP's delay in investment guarantee payments, amounting to NT$132 million (US$4 million), but only payed NT$44 million (US$1.4 million) by May 22. Seems like CPT is already having trouble mustering enough cash.</p>
