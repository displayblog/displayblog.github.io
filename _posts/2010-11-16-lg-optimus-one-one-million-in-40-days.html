<p><a href="http://www.lg.com/global/press-release/article/lg-optimus-one-hits-1-million-sales-worldwide.jsp">LG</a>: The Optimus One is the fastest-selling phone in the company's history. The Optimus One is known as the Optimus S on Sprint and the Optimus T on T-Mobile and Vortex on Verizon. Vortex will be launching on November 18th. LG's budget focus is paying off. The Optimus One sports a 3.2-inch 480x320 LCD with Android 2.2. LG expects its best-selling phone to hit 10 million, a company first.</p>
