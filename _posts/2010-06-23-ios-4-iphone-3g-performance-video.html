<p>The iPhone 3G's performance running iOS 4 and iPhone OS 3.1.3 is on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adriannier/4724180371">video</a>. Here are the results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Camera: Launch is 40% slower on iOS 4. Shoot is 54% slower on iOS 4.</li>
<li>Settings: Launch is 125% slower on iOS 4.</li>
<li>Safari: Loading the New York Times is 37% faster on iOS 4.</li><br />
</ul><br />
Some mention the calendar app and the maps app become completely useless on an iOS 4 iPhone 3G. For others the trick is to do a clean reinstall, which results in iOS 4 performance that is equally as fast as 3.1.3 on the iPhone 3G.</p>
