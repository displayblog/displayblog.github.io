<p><a href="http://blog.surface.com/2015/03/announcing-surface-3/">Microsoft</a>: The new Atom-based Surface 3 sports a 10.8-inch 1920x1280 display. Just like the larger 12-inch Surface Pro 3 the Surface 3 features a 3:2 aspect ratio display, which is a better compromise than the 16:9 tablets out there. This has been and continues to be a good move by Microsoft. Interestingly, the iPhones from the original to the 4S featured 3:2 aspect ratios.</p>
