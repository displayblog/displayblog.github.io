<p>Responding to <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/video/apple-watch-revolutionize-personal-device-25396956">ABC News</a> David Muir&acirc;&euro;&trade;s question, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;How did it feel?&acirc;&euro;¬ù</p>
<p>Jony Ive:</p>
<blockquote><p>It felt good. It's a &mdash; it's a shocking transition, when you go from, we're working on this for three years and &mdash; it's a relatively small team.</p>
<p>So it's a big transition, from working quietly together on something to then suddenly millions of people know what you're doing.</blockquote></p>
<p>In the interview Ive was wearing his Apple Watch loose. I'm certain the optical sensors behind the Apple Watch weren't properly in contact with his skin. I wonder if the sensors can still work that way... </p>
