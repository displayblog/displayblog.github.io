<p><a href="http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20080805006296&newsLang=en">BusinessWire</a> &rarr; <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/08/05/sharp-intros-entry-level-sb-series-of-1080p-lcd-hdtvs/">Engadget</a>: The Sharp LC-42SB45U is part of the company's SB series of entry-level LCD TVs. Entry-level should mean low prices. With a MSRP of US$1399.99 for the LC-42SB45U, Vizio won't be worried, but I expect street prices to be quite a bit lower than that. I'm look forward to major brands having $999 prices for 42" LCD TVs that are 1080p capable by the end of the year. The LC-42SB45U sports a pixel format of 1920x1080, which is good, and a response time of 6.5ms, also good. More analysis and the full press release after the break.</p>
<p>The LC-42SB45U doesn't have any fancy features such as 120Hz, motion interpolation, LED backlight, etc. but it has three things: size (42"), 1080p and price. So if those three are the most important factors for you, then Sharp's LC-42SB45U should fit the bill. Just don't expect motion-blur-free Olympics coverage on it.</p>
