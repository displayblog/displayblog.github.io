<p class="P1">The F9 Series was introduced at IFA 2007 in Berlin, Germany. The piano black chassis is nice, but is getting somewhat old, but unfortunately there is nothing better than black to create an immersed sensation... I take that back. Philips' Ambilight does in fact create a more immersive environment. Got sidetracked by the nice-but-ho-hum design; on to the features. The 1080p LCD TV comes in two sizes. Of the two, the 70" should be quite a stunner as it would be one of the largest LCD TVs you can buy. Both have a special feature: LED backlights. I am not sure what type of LEDs Samsung is using but I am guessing that it is not RGB LEDs. If the LED technology was RGB, I wouldn't hear the end of how great the color gamut is as a percentage of NTSC. But that is not the case here. Instead, the focus is on lower power consumption, by about 30%. That seems to be a clue, but I am not sure. The 500,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio is absurdly high, but as backlights move from CCFL to LED technology, the numbers will become insane as local dimming or area focused luminance control (AFLC) becomes smarter. Another interesting feature, but quite unnecessary for most folks, me included, is the Auto-wall mount feature that allows the tilting of the F9 Series 20 degrees to either side and 15 degrees up and down. I would want to position the nicely crafted furniture piece, investment perhaps considering the price of the 70", right where I would consider the sweet spot: dead ahead from where my eyes are when I am sitting in my comfy sofa.</p></p>
