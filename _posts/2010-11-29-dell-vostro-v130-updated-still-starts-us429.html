<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/30/dell-vostro-v130-updated-with-more-ports-fancy-hyperbaric-coo/">Engadget</a>: The Dell Vostro V130 is still as thin as ever at just 0.65 inch in the front and 0.78 inch in the rear. The 13.3-inch packs 1366x768 pixels and now sports: VGA & HDMI out, two USB 2.0 ports, SIM card slot, and a shared USB/eSATA port. The built-in webcam also gets an upgrade. Not sure exactly what was upgraded though. Another enigmatic feature: Intel's Advanced Cooling Technology called Hyperbaric Cooling. And last but not least you get two additional color options: Lucerne Red and Aberdeen Silver. Still starts at a bargain-basement price of just $429.</p>
