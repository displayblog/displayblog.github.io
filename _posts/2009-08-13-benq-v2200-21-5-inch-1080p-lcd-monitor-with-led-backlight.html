<p><strong>LED</strong> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=benq&amp;sa=Search#1456">BenQ</a>'s V2200 is a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=21.5-inch+lcd+monitor&amp;sa=Search#1506">21.5-inch LCD monitor</a> with a 1920 x 1080 resolution. Unlike almost 99.9-percent of LCD monitors out there the V2200 sports a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=led+backlight&amp;sa=Search#1627">LED backlight</a>. LEDs are better than CCFLs (the typical technology used in a LCD backlight for monitors) in many ways: lower power consumption (in this case 36-percent less), more rugged (LEDs are solid state, CCFLs are tubes that can break), longer lasting, no mercury (very important!), and allows for very thin designs when used in an edge-lit configuration.</p>
<p><strong>Thin is In</strong> Thin designs can be hit or miss but from a resource point of view thin designs require less material, weighs less, and with a smartly designed box can reduce transportation costs significantly. From the looks of it the V2200 (and the larger 24-inch V2400) makes use of an edge-lit LED backlight because it looks so thin, but I could be wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Green</strong> BenQ went a little overboard stating that the dynamic contrast ratio is 5,000,000:1. Yeah right. These numbers don't mean anything. In Eco mode the V2200 consumes 30-percent less power than in normal mode. The chassis is constructed from 28-percent recycled plastic. So the V2200 and the larger V2400 looks to be the result of some very good work bringing many good ideas to reduce its environmental footprint.</p>
