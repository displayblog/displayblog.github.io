<blockquote><p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;We are both fanatical in terms of care and attention to things people don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t see immediately,&acirc;&euro; Ive said. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s like finishing the back of a drawer. Nobody&acirc;&euro;&trade;s going to see it, but you do it anyway. Products are a form of communication&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;they demonstrate your value system, what you care about.&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;You discover that very few people have the level of perfection we do. It is actually very sick,&acirc;&euro; Newson said. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;It is neurotic.&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>Later, waving his hand around the Claridge&acirc;&euro;&trade;s suite, Ive said, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;All of us in this room see the same things, the same objects, but Marc and I see what&acirc;&euro;&trade;s behind them.&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;We are both obsessed with the way things are made,&acirc;&euro; Newson said. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;The Georg Jensen pitcher&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m not even sure I love the way it looks, but I love how it is made starting with a sheet of silver.&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;We seldom talk about shapes,&acirc;&euro; Ive said, referring to his conversations with Newson. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;We talk about process and materials and how they work.&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not about form, really&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s about a lot of other things,&acirc;&euro; Newson said.</blockquote></p>
<p>Ive and Newson are hands-on craftsmen obsessed with materials.</p>
