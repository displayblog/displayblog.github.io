  SPH-W6050 is a high-end smartphone sporting a 3\" TFT LCD with touch and haptic
  feedback. The 3\" LCD features a 800 x 480 (landscape) pixel format and looks pretty
  nice. On the back is a huge lens coupled with a 5MP CMOS image sensor. The picture
  quality is very good but there is some shutter lag so you'll need to hold steady.
  Yes, even with the anti-shake technology fast moving objects will probably be quite
  blurry. The DMB functionality is quite cool: you can watch pretty much wherever
  you are in Korea. The SPH-W6050 is a bit smaller than an iPhone 3G but is a bit
  thicker. At first I couldn't figure out how to turn the SPH-W6050 on: there is a
  rubber \"Hold\" button the right side of the device. You have to press that button
  and then press it again to unlock. Notice also the front-facing camera: that's for
  video communications and the SPH-W6050 will let you do that for 2 hours. Check the
  lightning review video after the jump. "
