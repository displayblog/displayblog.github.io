<blockquote><p>I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve known James for many years, and he&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a great guy with a ton of friends in the Mac and iOS developer community. And I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve raved about PCalc many times before &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s my favorite calculator app for iOS, hands-down. Let&acirc;&euro;&trade;s turn a bad day into a good one for him with a lot of sales of PCalc (and downloads of the free PCalc Lite, which also was updated today.)</blockquote></p>
<p>Downloaded my copy of <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pcalc-lite-calculator/id300311831?mt=8">PCalc Lite</a>. This is what I like about apps on iOS: simply beautiful, eminently usable UI.</p>
