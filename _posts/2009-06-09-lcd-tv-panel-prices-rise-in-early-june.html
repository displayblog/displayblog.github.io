<p>According to DisplaySearch's PriceWise report LCD TV panel prices continued to rise in June. In particular 32-inch (1366 x 768) LCD TV panels increased US$10 to US$190. 37-inch (1366 x 768) also increased by US$10, to US$253. 42-inch (1920 x 1080) LCD TV panels prices gained US$15 to US$335. According to the Austin-based display market research company, demand is outstripping supply for these panels due to strong demand from China combined with a shortage of components.</p>
<p>Will higher LCD TV panel prices lead to higher set prices? That would be the logical conclusion and it will certainly happen if panel prices continue to increase. But there have been reports stating that LCD TV demand in the EU and in North America is slowing. To jump start demand some TV brands are planning to lower prices. What that means is that some TV brands are willing to lower profit margins to increase sales. If demand for LCD TVs does not increase in the EU and North America inventory will build up despite strong demand coming from China.</p>
