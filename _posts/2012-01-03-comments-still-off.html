<blockquote><p>Just over a month ago, <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2011/11/29/comments-off/">I switched comments off for this blog</a>. I wanted to post a very brief follow-up on that decision.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, it was <em>definitely the right move</em>.</blockquote></p>
<p>Gemmell lists several benefits, which I've also experienced since turning off comments a while back.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> <em>via</em> <a href="http://512pixels.net/macstories-to-go-comment-less/">Stephen Hackett</a>. <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/on-comments/">Cody Fink</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Commenting leaves a lot of baggage that we simply don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have the time maintain, and that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not a good thing for us or our readers. Instead of putting readers in danger by failing to moderate a malicious link, or failing to moderate an offensive opinion, we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re simply going to remove comments and leave commenters the choice of using Twitter or their personal blogs to write informed and well spoken opinions that our comments section doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t provide room for. The answer isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t as simple as, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;We don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t like comments.&acirc;&euro;¬ù There are a lot of reasons behind why we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve reached our decision, and we hope our contribution to the discussion provides an ample explanation for when we eventually remove the feature.</blockquote></p>
<p>Part of my M&P (Mission & Purpose) for DisplayBlog entails I focus most of my time curating and writing, about displays, photography, design and other stuff I'm interested in. Not moderating.</p>
<p><em>Update 2:</em> <a href="http://inessential.com/2012/01/04/comments_on_blogs">Brent Simmons</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I see my blog that way: it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s one place on the web, the place where I write. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s one leaf on a tree. It doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have to contain everything. These days there are so many ways and places to comment &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; so many other tools &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; that including comments here would be Emacs-like.</blockquote></p>
