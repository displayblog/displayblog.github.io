<p>A <a href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/tech/2011/07/133_91113.html">Korea Times</a> source:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s upcoming iPad 3 will feature an improved display to support quad extended graphics (QXGA), a display resolution of 2048&Atilde;&mdash;1536 pixels with a 4:3 aspect ratio to provide full high definition (HD) viewing experience.</blockquote></p>
<p>A Retina Display-equipped iPad, an <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/07/06/why-the-higher-end-ipad-model-will-be-called-ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> is what I'd call it. The article points to both Samsung and LG Display being suppliers of the 9.7-inch Retina Display, but I think Samsung will either be a very small player or not a player at all.</p>
