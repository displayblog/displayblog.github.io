<p>Christopher Breen at <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/152358/2010/06/copy_imovies2ipad.html">Macworld</a> has found something invaluable: you can copy iMovie clips from the iPhone 4 to the iPad via the <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC531ZM/A">iPad Camera Connection Kit</a> ($29, ships in 4-6 weeks at the time of this writing). The iPad sees the iPhone 4 and earlier iPhones as a digital camera. Once the iPhone is connected to the iPad the iPad's Photos app will launch. Tap the iMovies you want to copy and the magic begins. The 720/30p iMovies will look much better on the larger display on the iPad. Of course they will look even better on displays with at least a 1280x720 pixel format.</p>
