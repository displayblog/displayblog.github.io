<p>Brad Molen, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/08/11/nokia-n9-gets-axed-in-germany-global-tour-looks-even-more-meage/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;] Nokia's confirmed with German site MobiFlip that the N9 will in fact not be making its way to Deutschland, just days after making it known that it has no plans to send the device to the US or the UK. [&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;]</blockquote></p>
<p>Nokia has a winner with its Meego-powered N9. Why the company isn't making the N9 widely available is anyone's guess, but my guess is that it has less to do with what Nokia wants to do and more to do with what Microsoft wants.</p>
