<p><a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250:utpr0mvi0e9&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=chi+mei+optoelectronics&amp;sa=Search">Chi Mei Optoelectronics</a> (CMO) is upbeat about 2009. The Taiwan-based manufacture of LCDs expects LCD panel shipments to increase 20% Y/Y from 63 million to 76 million units in 2009. CMO is gearing itself for a 25 million LCD TV panel year, growing 25% Y/Y. The company is benefiting from the Chinese government's policies that are designed to give incentives of about 13% in government subsidies toward purchasing electronic goods and home appliances in rural areas. CMO recently won a four-year LCD panel order from a Chinese firm that can be worth about 7 to 10 million LCD panels according to sources.</p>
