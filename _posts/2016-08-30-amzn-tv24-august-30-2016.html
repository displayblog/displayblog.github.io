<p><a href="http://displayblog.com/2016/08/25/amzn-tv24/">Click here for a brief description about DISPLAYBLOG's AMZN.TV24 market research</a>. Today I'll be answering the questions:&nbsp;What are&nbsp;the most popular sizes for 4K? And 1080p?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>1080p Size Share</strong></p><br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26859" src="http://displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/AMZNTV24_20160830_SizeShare1080p.jpg" alt="AMZN.TV24 2016.08.30 Size Share 1080p" width="590" height="398" /></p>
<p>There are five sizes that make up almost all of the 1080p TVs that show up on the front search result page on Amazon. Here are some observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>55-inch TVs have slowly grown over the last 12 data points and now have captured 40%.</li>
<li>50-inch TVs were the largest just 7 days ago, but now has dropped down to 20% for a tie for #2.</li>
<li>60-inch TVs are tied for #2.</li>
<li>65-inch and 75-inch 1080p TVs make up 10% each.</li><br />
</ul><br />
As I've mentioned before 55-inch is becoming the minimum size for a living room TV, and it might also become the minimum size for most TVs: family room, bedrooms, offices, boardrooms, meeting rooms, mancaves, etc.</p>
<p>I think 50-inch will continue to dwindle as we move to larger TVs. For 2016 55-inch 1080p TVs will be the most popular, but soon after that 60-inch will be at 1080p.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>4K Size Share</strong></p><br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26861" src="http://displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/AMZNTV24_20160830_SizeShare4K.jpg" alt="AMZN.TV24 2016.08.30 Size Share 4K" width="590" height="398" /></p>
<p>Let's start off with some observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>55-inch dominates with 40%+ share.</li>
<li>65-inch is at #2 with roughly 30% share.</li>
<li>60-inch is at #3 followed by 70-inch.</li>
<li>50-inch has fallen out.</li><br />
</ul><br />
Although 20%+ of 1080p TVs are 50 inch, there are none at 4K. The reason I think is because consumers want something bigger when it comes to upgrading to 4K. A 4K TV is a major upgrade to most consumers since it requires additional spending to acquire&nbsp;4K content.</p>
<p>Similar to 1080p, 55-inch TVs are dominant and will probably continue to be at #1 throughout 2016.</p>
<p>Unlike 1080p, 65-inch is #2 with about 30% share. It would seem 60-inch should be #2, but for some reason TV brands and LCD manufacturers have decided 65-inch is the better size for 4K. So look for 2017 to be when 65-inch, not 60-inch, becomes the most popular size.</p>
