<blockquote><p>RIM is internally optimistic about the marketability of its PlayBook tablet PC and therefore has placed large-volume orders for shipments in the second and third quarters of 2011. Taiwan-based ODM Quanta Computer may ship more than one million PlayBooks a month in the third quarter, according to sources from component makers.</blockquote></p>
<p>One million PlayBooks per month may be shipped, but how many will actually sell?</p>
