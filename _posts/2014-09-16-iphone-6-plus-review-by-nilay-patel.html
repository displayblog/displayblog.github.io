<p>Nilay Patel, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/16/6155009/apple-iphone-6-plus-review">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The 6 Plus has an absolutely stunning display. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a 5.5-inch 1920 x 1080 panel, which works out to 401 pixels per inch. That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the highest-density display Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s ever shipped, but there&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a whole range of Android phones out there with big and great-looking high-density screens: the 5.1-inch <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/4/14/5608222/samsung-galaxy-s5-review">Samsung Galaxy S5</a> at 432ppi, the 5-inch <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/25/5544642/htc-one-review-m8">HTC One M8</a> at 441ppi, the 5.7-inch <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/3/6098289/samsungs-galaxy-note-4-announcement-price-availability-hands-on">Galaxy Note 4</a> at 515ppi, and the 5.5-inch <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/4/5778556/lg-g3-review">LG G3</a> at an insane 538ppi.</p>
<p>Of course, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s debateable whether your eyes can even perceive any of these higher pixel densities, and driving all those extra dots takes a toll on battery life. Apple seems to have aimed firmly at the middle ground with the iPhone 6 Plus: it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a great-looking display that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s plenty sharp, but it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not so crazy high-res in the service of specs that it needs a bigger battery to keep it lit up all day.</blockquote></p>
<p>Middle ground, is accurate. The ability to visually perceive high pixel densities is debatable, too. And so I debate: I am over 40 and I can tell the difference, but my wife &mdash; who knows a thing or two about eyes &mdash; tells me I have unusually sensitive eyes.</p>
<blockquote><p>The iPhone 6 Plus camera is the best smartphone camera I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve ever used. Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s holding firm at 8 megapixels while everyone else is racing to put ever-bigger numbers on spec sheets, and it feels like the right decision: the iPhone 6 Plus focuses faster, works better in low light, and generally produces the best photos I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve ever seen from a phone.</p>
<p>The 6 Plus has the same basic shooter as the iPhone 6, but it adds optical image stabilization to the mix, which improves low-light performance even more. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not going to help you when you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re shooting anything that moves, like people, but for sunsets and skylines, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s clutch. It basically lets the camera hold the shutter open a little bit longer than it otherwise could without causing a blurry image, so more light hits the sensor. If you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re like me and you mostly find yourself taking photos at dusk and in dark rooms, you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll end up with many more usable shots. Until you take too many shots and everything gets blurry regardless.</blockquote></p>
<p>Funny. Optical image stabilization (OIS) paired with phase detection autofocus should be really fun to use. I hope autofocus accuracy is just as good as the non-phase detection autofocusing iPhone 5s.</p>
<p>Having two portable devices &mdash; an iPhone and an iPad &mdash; is getting tiring. Two devices to carry around, two devices to charge, two cables, two plugs, two devices to update, etc. I would like to have just one, and that is what makes the gigantic iPhone 6 Plus tempting.</p>
<p>If I do get the iPad Nano there will be something I will do that I have not done since the original iPhone: buy a case and keep it on. Why? Two things. The butt ugly antenna lines and the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/08/22/iphone-6-camera-lens-bulge/">protruding camera lens</a>.</p>
