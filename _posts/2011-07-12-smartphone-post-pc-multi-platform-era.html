<p><a href="http://www.asymco.com/2011/07/12/measuring-mobile-platform-churn-in-the-us-market">Horace Dediu</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve argued that the post-PC era will be a multi-platform era. Although it may seem that the situation in the US is rapidly moving toward a duopoly, it may not end up that way. Note how much non-consumption still exists.</blockquote></p>
<p>Purple is Other and Red is webOS. For the month of May, based on comScore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Android: +2.1 million users</li>
<li>iPhone: +1.0M</li>
<li>webOS/Palm: -96K</li>
<li>BlackBerry: -202K</li>
<li>Other: -95K</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>What I'd like to know is: How will this chart look in March 2012 or 2013? Will US smartphone share continue to increase at current rates? Will Android, in particular?</p>
