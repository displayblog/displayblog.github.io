<p>[ <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-29/apple-said-to-prepare-ipad-upgrades-and-refreshed-mac-lineup">Bloomberg</a> ] Mark Gurman and Jungah Lee:</p>
<blockquote><p>In addition to the new Macs, Apple is working on a new standalone monitor to connect to its computers, according to the people. After exiting the monitor business earlier this year with the discontinuation of the 27-inch Thunderbolt display, Apple is working with LG Electronics on a new monitor with a high-resolution &ldquo;5K&rdquo; screen, according to one of the people.&nbsp;Apple currently sells an iMac with a built-in 5K panel, which&nbsp;includes over seven times as many pixels as standard 1080p displays.</blockquote><br />
LG Electronics or LGE <em>might</em> be Apple's integrator for the rumored 27-inch 5K monitor, but I think it's not LGE whose working with Apple. Most likely Foxconn or some other company with massive manufacturing facilities in China will actually integrate or build the monitor. Where 'LG' comes in is with the display itself: the 27-inch 5K LCD panel. That panel will most likely be manufactured by LG Display or LGD.</p>
<p>Apple is expected to unveil a new iPhone, probably iPhone 7, on September 7 in San Francisco along with some other devices, such as a 27-inch 5K monitor, a new Apple Watch 2, and maybe some new Macs.</p>
