<p><a href="http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/fully-printed-carbon-nanotube-219814.aspx">Jennifer Marcus, UCLA Newsroom</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now, researchers from <a href="http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/new-technology-startup-joins-ucla-150392.aspx">Aneeve Nanotechnologies</a>, a startup company at UCLA's on-campus technology incubator at the <a href="http://www1.cnsi.ucla.edu/index">California NanoSystems Institute</a> (CNSI), have used low-cost ink-jet printing to fabricate the first circuits composed of fully printed back-gated and top-gated carbon nanotube&acirc;&euro;&ldquo;based electronics for use with OLED displays. The research was published this month in the journal <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl202765b">Nano Letters</a>.</blockquote></p>
<p>Instead of requiring expensive vacuum deposition equipment inkjet printed OLED circuitry can make use of roll-to-roll printing, on plastic.</p>
<p>Associate adjunct professor of materials science at UCLA Engineering and a co-founder of Aneeve, Kos Galatsis:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is the first practical demonstration of carbon nanotube&acirc;&euro;&ldquo;based printed circuits for display backplane applications. We have demonstrated carbon nanotubes' viable candidacy as a competing technology alongside amorphous silicon and metal-oxide semiconductor solution as a low-cost and scalable backplane option.</blockquote></p>
