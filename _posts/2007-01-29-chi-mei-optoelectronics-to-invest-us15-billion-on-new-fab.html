<p>Chi Mei Optoelectronics (CMO), the second largest LCD manufacturer in Taiwan, is planning to borrow NT$52.5 billion (about US$1.59 billion) to construct a next generation LCD fab in Taiwan. The amount is NT$12.5 billion more than originally planned. The loan will be financed by 20 banks including Bank of America, HSBC Holdings, Bank of Taiwan, Chinatrust Commercial Bank and First Commercial Bank. The large amount of investment toward a LCD fab suggest that it will be a G7 or larger fab.</p>
