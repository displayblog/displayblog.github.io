<p>Sony is warning users of VAIO notebooks that they can overheat according <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/01/technology/01sony.html?src=busln">The New York Times</a>. When can this happen? Exactly when you don't want it to: when you plug in the power adapter to charge the battery when the battery is almost empty. Sony is attempting to fix this problem via a software patch, a BIOS firmware update to be exact. Sony has communicated this with registered users, but how many of you out there using a Sony VAIO notebook are registered? Make sure to contact customer support (866-496-7669 in the US) and get that software patch. Sooner the better since keyboards or the casing can deform due to partial melting. Overheating can also be a burn hazard.</p>
<p>Affected VAIO notebooks include model numbers beginning with VPCF11 or VPCWW2. Full model number list can be found on <a href="http://esupport.sony.com/perl/news-item.pl?news_id=401&amp;amp;template_id=1&amp;amp;region_id=1">Sony's eSupport site</a> as well as the BIOS firmware update.</p>
