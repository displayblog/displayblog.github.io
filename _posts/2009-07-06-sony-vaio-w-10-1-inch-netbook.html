<p>If it looks like a netbook, smells like netbook, it is most likely a netbook. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=sony&amp;sa=Search#1541">Sony</a> can say whatever it wants, the VAIO W is a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=netbook&amp;sa=Search#1572">netbook</a>. The W features a 10.1-inch LCD sporting a 1366 x 768 resolution and is powered by Intel's 1.6GHz Atom. For a 10-inch netbook, the VAIO W has a lot of pixels. For some the fonts at their default settings on Windows might be a bit too small. The pixels are powered by Intel's underpowered GMA 950, unfortunately. And just like any other netbook, the keyboard will be a bit too small for most average folks. The W doesn't look very sleek but is more on the cute side and seems to be geared for those who are playful.
