<blockquote><p>Pent-up demand for Apple's new iPad 3 as well as a slight dip in the price of the existing iPad 2 contributed to Apple's impressive 170% QoQ jump. Samsung, Apple's main competitor in the market took a significant hit as consumers switched en masse to purchasing iPads instead of Galaxy Tabs in Q2.</blockquote></p>
