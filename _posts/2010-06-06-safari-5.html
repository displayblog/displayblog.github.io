<p>There is a rumor that Safari 5 will be announced during WWDC 2010. One of the more interesting features of Safari 5 is Safari Reader. It seems some think this feature akin to Google Reader but I don't think it is. Take a look at the text from French blog <a href="http://www.macgeneration.com/news/voir/157341/exclu-mac-os-10.6.4-et-safari-5-pour-la-wwdc">MacGeneration</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Safari Reader: Click on the new Reader icon to view articles on the web in a single, clutter-free page.</blockquote><br />
I have been using <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/">Readability</a> for quite some time. Readability does exactly as described above: it strips all the crap from a webpage, formats it in a nice readable font (I think Georgia or something similar) and allows me to simply read. Readability has also strongly influenced the design of DisplayBlog. I think Safari Reader is something like or incredibly similar to Readability, and nothing like Google Reader. I'm glad this feature will be built into Safari.</p>
<p>In Apple's continued battle with Google it is offering another search option: Bing. I'm sure Microsoft is happy and Google not so much.* I wonder if Spotlight's desktop search capabilities can be extended to the web...</p>
<p>Hardware-accelerated graphics will be one of many other improvements. Personally I turn off the discrete graphics card because I hardly ever need the power. I'm just a blogger who deals with text and images most of the time with infrequent YouTube video embeds. And battery life is much more important to me, so is the fan-free silence. An option to disable this hardware acceleration in Safari 5 is a must.</p>

<p>*Just as a FYI, according to <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp">w3schools.com</a> Safari commanded just 3.5% of browser usage in May. Limited to PC browser usage most likely. The latest from <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2010/5/comScore_Releases_April_2010_U.S._Search_Engine_Rankings">comScore</a> shows Internet search conducted on Microsoft sites was 11.8% in April and Google's share was 64.4%. The results are limited to the US. Adding Bing as a search option on Safari looks on paper to be a fairly important development but its potential impact on Internet search will probably be less so.</p>
