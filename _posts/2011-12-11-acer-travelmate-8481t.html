<blockquote><p>While I'm not apt to be quite as critical of poor displays on notebooks that are clearly designed to be portable word processors (the screen on my Lenovo ThinkPad X100e is absolutely horrible), I still really wish manufacturers would at least <em>try</em> to produce a notebook screen in quantity that doesn't completely suck.</blockquote></p>
<p>And the display, a matte 14-inch 1366x768 LCD manufactured by LG Display (model number LP140WH6-TJB1), in the Acer TravelMate 8481T does in fact completely suck: a 149:1 contrast ratio, washed out blacks with a 1.6-nit brightness level, a Delta E of 9.56 (that means color accuracy is nowhere to be seen).</p>
<p>If you're in the market for a notebook and absolutely need the best display the matte IPS LCD on the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/03/07/lenovo-thinkpad-x220-tablet-ips-is-back/">ThinkPad X220</a> is in my opinion one of the very best.</p>
