<blockquote><p>The 29-inch EA93 boasts 2560 x 1080 resolution, and since the aspect ratio is identical to that of a typical movie theater screen, contents are shown just the way they were intended. But it isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t only the size of the screen that makes the monitor so adept with multimedia, the EA93 accurately captures 100 percent of the defined sRGB color space, and the monitor delivers 300nit brightness for higher quality, more lifelike colors. Put simply, IPS technology plus a cinematic screen is the ideal combination for entertainment.</blockquote></p>
<p>LG Electronics announced its EA93 21:9 IPS LCD monitor geared for film aficionados, just when <a href="http://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&id=1346136568">Philips decides to kills its Cinema 21:9 TVs</a>.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of technical specifications: 178/178-degree viewing angles, and 5-ms GTG response times. Funny, LG states the contrast ratio for its EA93 monitor as 'Mega'. I guess it's really big. Unfortunately the resolution of 95.8 ppi isn't all that impressive.</p>
<p>I've been watching a lot more videos on my 17-inch MacBook Pro and every time, whether it be Hulu or Netflix DVDs, I've been dealing with black bars top and bottom. A LG EA93 monitor would get rid of those bars, which would be nice. Just one question: How much?</p>
