<p><a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/11/20/startup-kateeva-to-super-size-oled-tvs-cell-phone-screens-for-less/">Ucilia Wang, Gigaom</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most standard OLED makers deposit the semiconductors on a substrate covered with a mask, which is removed after it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s coated with the organic materials. Oxygen and moisture are deadly to OLEDs, and most manufacturers have to apply a coating to insulate OLEDs from these elements. But that encapsulation step is where problems tend to crop up and slow down production.</p>
<p>Kateeva&acirc;&euro;&trade;s equipment prints [OLEDs] in nitrogen to skirt the oxygen and moisture issue and in the process also creates OLED panels that deliver good visual quality for a longer period of time [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>Kateeva's YIELDJet can print on glass substrates large enough to cut six 55-inch OLED displays. Looking forward to OLED TVs much more affordable than the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2013/07/23/samsung-kn55sn/">Samsung KN55SN</a> or the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2013/07/22/lg-55ea9800/">LG 55EA9800</a>, both of which sport stratospheric prices.</p>
