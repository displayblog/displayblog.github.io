<p>Samsung's YP-K3 follows the tradition of its sibling YP-K5 with ultra-modern design in its simplicity. One of the cooler design bits of the YP-K3 is the user interface that involves a 1.8" organic light emitting diode (OLED) display and icons and text that have simple bright colors with a black background. It's a stroke of genius.</p>

<p>Why? OLED displays consume a lot of energy and if Samsung were to have used a typical UI with a black background and white text it would have consumed considerably more power. With white on black, most of the emitters are off. I also like the touch-sensitive directional pad and find it quite elegant.</p>
