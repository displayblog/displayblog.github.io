<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=hp">HP</a>'s iPAQ Data Messenger looks quite nice. I like the simple lines. I'm glad HP kept shiny things to a minimum. The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=2.81"">2.81"</a> transmissive TFT LCD incorporates touch capabilities; you can use your finger or a stylus. HP seems to think "<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led-backlight">LED backlight</a>" is something special with small TFT LCDs but let me tell you: nearly 100% of all TFT LCDs used in mobile phones (including <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=smartphone">smartphone</a>s) use a LED backlight. So it really isn't anything special. The built-in 3.1MP camera sports a LED flash and has an autofocus feature. Photo quality will most likely not be all that great, but that's nothing special either since most smartphones are really terrible, except for a few exceptions like Nokia's N95. The iPAQ Data Messenger packs a lot of connectivity options: WiFi (802.11b/g), Bluetooth 2.0 with EDR, 3G (900/1900/2100 MHz), HSDPA (up to 7.2Mbps), HSUPA (up to 2Mbps), GSM, GPRS, EDGE (850/900/1800/1900MHz). Oh, almost forgot: the Data Messenger has a slide-out QWERTY keyboard to boot. Nice. Not-so-nice: Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional.</p>
