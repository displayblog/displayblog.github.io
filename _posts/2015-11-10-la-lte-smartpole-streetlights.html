<p>[ <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/aarontilley/2015/11/05/los-angeles-becomes-first-city-to-test-the-future-of-wireless-connectivity-with-small-cells-on-streetlights/">Forbes</a> ] Aaron Tilley:</p>
<blockquote><p>Los Angeles publicly announced Thursday that it&nbsp;is outfitting 100 streetlights with a type of networking gear called small cells in an effort to&nbsp;start improving cell phone coverage. Called SmartPoles, the streetlights are part of a collaboration between LED lighting giant <span class="quotecard ng-isolate-scope" data-ticker="null" data-exchange="null" data-type="organization" data-naturalid="fred/company/3667" data-quotes-closing="0.0" data-quotes-now="0.0" data-link="/companies/philips" data-name="Philips"><a class="ng-binding" href="http://www.forbes.com/companies/philips" target="_self">Philips</a> </span>and telecom equipment giant <span class="quotecard ng-isolate-scope" data-ticker="null" data-exchange="null" data-type="organization" data-naturalid="fred/company/1494" data-quotes-closing="0.0" data-quotes-now="0.0" data-link="/companies/ericsson" data-name="Ericsson"><a class="ng-binding" href="http://www.forbes.com/companies/ericsson" target="_self">Ericsson</a> </span>. The two European companies announced they were working together on a small cell product in 2014, and LA is the first city to rollout the technology.</blockquote><br />
Streetlights are everywhere -- 120,000 can potentially be transformed into SmartPoles&nbsp;in Los Angeles -- so adding LTE small cells is smart. I wonder though:&nbsp;might WiFi have been a better option? You can connect to the Internet with&nbsp;your laptop, tablet, iPod touch, and smartphone.</p>
