<p>Sharp showcased a 108" LCD TV at CES 2007. This is larger than what LG.Philips LCD (LPL) showed last year at SID in San Francisco by 8". With Sharp's new G8 LCD fab as the largest in the world, it is no surprise that Sharp bested LPL. Although this was probably just a technology demonstration that allowed Sharp to say that they have the largest LCD TV, even if it were to be marketed, the price would be so high ($50,000 or more?) it would be a commercial disaster. I hope it has a pixel format considerably more than 1920 x 1080. I'm not holding my breath.</p>
