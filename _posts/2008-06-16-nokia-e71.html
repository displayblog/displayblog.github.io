<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=nokia">Nokia</a>'s E71 is a very slender <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=smartphone">smartphone</a> with a built-in QWERTY keyboard. With <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=3g">3G</a> capability you can video call via the forward facing camera. Although I wouldn't want the person on the other end of the phone suffer through having to see me all the time, the option to inflict such pain from time to time sounds cool. The E71 is ultra-thin and the full QWERTY keyboard make for doing work as wall as texting as easy as pie.</p>
