<p><a href="http://lala.cursivebuildings.com/">Cursive Buildings</a> via <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5017847/3d-gifs-made-from-old-stereo-cards-are-stupidly-simple-effective">Gizmodo</a>: 3D GIF files made from old stereo cards from the New York Public Library actually works. Look at the picture and the person seems to have depth. Joshua Heineman combines these stereo cards, which are 19th century photographs that contain two different views of the same subject, into a single two-frame GIF animation file. Pretty cool.
