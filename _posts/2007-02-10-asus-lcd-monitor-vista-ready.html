<p>Asustek announced Vista certification for its 22" MW221U and 20" MW201U LCD monitors. The Vista certification means that features such as Windows Sidebar are supported and compatible. Both displays support a native resolution of 1680 x 1050, good for the 20" MW201U, but a tad bit on the low side for the 22" MW221U since a 23" LCD monitor would give you quite a bit more at 1920 x 1200.</p>

With Asus' Trace Free technology, response times are fast at only 2ms. Both LCDs include Asus' Splendid Video Intelligence technology to improve image quality and color fidelity and sport a HDCP-enabled DVI-D connection, a VGA D-Sub connector. Both have a pair of 1W speakers, and include a cable management system in the base.<br />

I am not sure if Vista certification is that necessary for LCD monitors. In my opinion, as long as the LCD monitor is wide and has at least a 1440 x 900 pixels, it should work quite well with Vista. Of course, a 1920 x 1200 pixel format would be ideal, but that might bring up the entire Vista upgrade cost by quite a bit. A dual 17" LCD monitor might do well, though I would assume you'd need some type of software application to make the two into a single seamless desktop.<br />
