<p>[ <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/07/technology/personaltech/ces-4k-television.html">The New York Times</a> ] Brian X. Chen:</p>
<blockquote><p>But after interviewing several technology companies and testing a premium Samsung 4K TV for more than a week, I was less than convinced that 2016 would be a good year to buy one of the sets. Televisions with the 4K feature remain expensive, ranging from $1,000 to tens of thousands of dollars. More important, the content available in the new 4K video resolution is sparse. And while images encoded in 4K do look better than normal high-definition ones, the differences aren&rsquo;t jaw-dropping.</blockquote><br />
Look out for 4K content that takes advantage of a technology called HDR or High Dynamic Range. TVs with backlit LED arrays can perform HDR and&nbsp;HDR 4K TVs displaying HDR 4K content look way better than 1080p. According to Brian Chen, "<a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/70305883">Marco Polo</a>" is a Netflix&nbsp;original HDR 4K.</p>
<p>4K TVs will continue to get bigger, better, and cheaper. At some point you'll need to bite the bullet. I'm planning to buy a 55-inch 4K OLED TV when prices fall&nbsp;to below US$1000. I don't know exactly when, but I hope it'll be sooner than later.</p>
