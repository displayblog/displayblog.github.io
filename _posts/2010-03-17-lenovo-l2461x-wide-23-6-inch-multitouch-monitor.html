<p>Lenovo's L2461x Wide is a 23.6-inch capacitive multitouch LCD monitor. Specs include: 300 cd/m2 brightness, 120Hz MEMC (Motion Estimation Motion Compensation) technology, four USB ports, 2.0MP webcam, built-in speakers and a mic. Pricing is around US$550.</p>
<p>Windows 7. Multitouch. LCD monitor. I don't think for one second that combining these three components will yield anything more than frustration resulting from using fingers to navigate dialog boxes, menus, icons that are build for a fine point of a mouse cursor. A complete revamped GUI focused on finger-based navigation working on top of Windows 7 would be necessary to prevent a call to Lenovo for a full refund.
