<p>The new Grand Canyon Skywalk makes it possible for the first time for visitors to see views of Grand Canyon's western edge. The Skywalk is a U-shaped glass bridge that is suspended 4,000 feet above the Colorado River.</p>
<p>Saint-Gobain, a glass technology company in the business for more than 300 years, designed and produced a durable and clear glass to make the Skywalk possible. The floor includes an inter-layer of DuPont's SentryGlas Plus that enhances optical clarity and adds to the strength of the floor. The company's accomplishments are many, but a couple of fine examples would be the creation of the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles in Paris in 1682 and the recent Pyramid of the Louvre.</p>

<p>Saint-Gobain's Cologne, Germany plant manufactured a low-iron Diamant glass that was used for the floor in the Skywalk. The deck is made of 46 pieces of laminated tempered glass with a thickness of more than 2". The Skywalk contains very little iron oxide compared to the typical glass leading to exceptional clarity.</p>
<p>I am only an amateur photographer, but the news of the Skywalk at the Grand Canyon is exciting. The clear glass will allow for some great pictures!
