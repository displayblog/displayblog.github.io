<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sony">Sony</a> let loose a behemoth, it's VAIO Type A <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=notebook-pc">notebook PC</a>s. This is one notebook PC where the equivalent word laptop would not apply. First off, the Type A's LCD has grown 1.4" to <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=18.4">18.4"</a>. It also sports a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led-backlight">LED backlight</a> instead of a CCFL backlight. The LED backlight makes it thinner and last longer but it also makes the LCD portion of the beast more durable. The aspect ratio changed too: from 16:10 to 16:9 and as a result the pixel format is now <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a>. That should be familiar as most high-end LCD TVs sport that pixel format these days. Unfortunately, you get 120 less vertical pixels, but think of it this way: when you're watching HD the picture will fit perfectly. And that's why Sony includes a Blu-ray burner with the Type A, so you don't miss those vertical pixels that it chopped off. As an amateur photographer I welcome the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=udma">UDMA</a>-enabled CF slot on the Type A. With CF capacity growing the faster the throughput the less waiting around for all of those beautiful shots to copy. The Type A will require a strong back (8.6lbs) and plenty of funds (about US$3000). You might also consider <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/08/13/lenovo-thinkpad-w700-17-notebook-pc/">Lenovo's W700 that's also geared for the photographing crowd and adds a WACOM digitizer</a>.</p>
