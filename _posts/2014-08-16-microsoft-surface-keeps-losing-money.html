<p><a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9250144/Surface_damage_mounts_at_Microsoft_as_red_ink_reaches_1.7B">Gregg Keizer, Computerworld</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Calculations by <em>Computerworld</em> show that the Surface's cost of revenue for the June quarter was $772 million. With revenue of $409 million, that put the tablet in the red to the tune of $363 million, the largest one-quarter loss for the Surface since Microsoft began providing quarterly revenue numbers.</blockquote></p>
