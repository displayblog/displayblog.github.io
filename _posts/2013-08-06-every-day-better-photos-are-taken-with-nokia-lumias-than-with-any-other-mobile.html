<p>Nokia's Lumia 925 ad &ldquo;<a href="http://youtu.be/PqfEE_X5cpQ">Better Photos Every Day</a>&rdquo; directly takes on the iPhone 5. The photos from the Lumia 925 definitely look better. Perhaps Nokia would have been more successful if the company had decided to build smart cameras instead of smart phones.</p>
