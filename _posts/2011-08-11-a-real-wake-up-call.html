<p>Don Clark, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2011/08/10/intel-sets-300-million-fund-to-spur-ultrabooks/">The Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Welch said Apple informed Intel that it better drastically slash its power consumption or would likely lose Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s business. "It was a real wake-up call to us," he said.</blockquote></p>
<p>Greg Welch is director of Intel's Ultrabook group. It's surprising that <em>Intel</em> was surprised. Can Intel continue to meet Apple's requirement for power efficient CPUs? Is an Apple-designed ARM-based MacBook in the near future?</p>
