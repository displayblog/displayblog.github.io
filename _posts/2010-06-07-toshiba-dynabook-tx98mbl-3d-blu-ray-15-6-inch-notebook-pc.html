<p>The Dynabook TX/98MBL from Toshiba is the world's first notebook to playback 3D Blu-ray. By combining an 120Hz LCD panel, active shutter 3D glasses, WinDVD BD, NVIDIA's 3D Vision software, GeForce GTS 350M with 1GB VRAM and a powerful Core i7-740QM 1.73GHz (boostable to 2.93GHz) CPU the Dynabook TX/98MBL looks like it has all the hardware goods to provide a stellar 3D Blu-ray experience. Other mundane specs include a 640GB hard drive and a puny maximum RAM of 4GB.</p>
<p>Now for the fantastically bad news about this otherwise very decent notebook PC: the LCD is just 15.6 inches and it sports a measly 1366x768 pixels. I am a simple person and I equate Blu-ray with 1080p. And that means to properly view Blu-ray any notebook or desktop must have a 1080p-capable display. In other words the pixel format better be at least 1920x1080. Although the Dynabook TX/98MBL is a powerful machine in and of itself, the display and 3D Blu-ray is a royal mismatch. It comes out at the end of July, but I would recommend waiting until Toshiba equips its 3D Blu-ray capable notebook PCs with at least a 1920x1080 display.
