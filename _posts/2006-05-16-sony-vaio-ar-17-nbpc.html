<p>The Sony VAIO AR-series NBPCs look nice and sleek. The AR190 has a Blu-ray optical drive built-in (very nice!), a 17" widescreen LCD with 1920 x 1200 pixel format, an nVidia Go 7600 GPU with 256MB to power it and a built-in TV tuner to entertain you with gobs of storage at 200GB! I didn't know that had 200GB notebook HDDs already...oh, they don't. This unit is using <i>two</i> 100GB HDDs in RAID 0 configuration. PVR'ing TVs and ripping DVDs (the ones you own) into the HDD won't be too much of a problem for this monster of a NBPC. Interestingly, this "PC" has a HDMI port so you can watch that protected Blu-ray content on something larger than the 17" screen. Here's the specification run-down:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU: 2.0GHz Core Duo T2500</li>
<li>17.0" 1920x1200</li>
<li>200GB (100GB x 2 RAID 0)</li>
<li>1GB PC2-4200 533MHz DDR2 (512MB x 2, max 2GB)</li>
<li>GPU: nVidia GeForce Go 7600GT 256MB</li>
<li>Blu-ray</li>
<li>Integrated PC-cam</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>All this weighs only 8.4lbs with the standard battery. Not bad. I wonder how much it's going to cost...</p>
