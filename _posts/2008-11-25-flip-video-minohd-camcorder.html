<p>I just watched <a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/25/catching-up-on-unfinished-business/">David Pogue's review of Flip Video's MinoHD camcorder</a>. He took it on his cruise trip to Europe and declared the Flip MinoHD "was smooth sailing all the way." To have a 720p-capable HD the size of a mobile phone right there with at all times must feel great: just whip out the MinoHD and start shooting HD video! And we're talking about real HD: 1280x720 at 30fps that is encoded in H.264 and saved as a MP4 file. He did mention that the MinoHD does not have optical zoom (limited to 2x digital zoom, which isn't really a zoom at all IMO) and there is no image stabilization. But for a MSRP of just US$229.99 you can't expect it to have everything that much MUCH more expensive HD camcorders have. But if you simply must receive a little discount because of the two lacking features, you're in luck! You can get this amazing little HD camcorder for just $206.99 with free shipping at Amazon.com. And how do you get all of those amazing HD videos onto your computer? Just flip out the USB connector, "jack" it into your computer, software pops up and you're on your way to organizing and video editing.</p></p>
