<p><a href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/online_mobile/in-u-s-market-new-smartphone-buyers-increasingly-embracing-android/">Don Kellogg at Nielsen</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to an August survey, 43 percent of all smartphone owners have an Android device. But if you ask only those who got a new smartphone in the past three months what kind of phone they chose, more than half (56%) will tell you they picked an Android device. The preferences of these so-called &acirc;&euro;&oelig;recent acquirers&acirc;&euro;¬ù are important as they are often a leading indicator of where the market is going.</blockquote></p>
<p>In this case, with <a href="/2011/09/27/lets-talk-iphone/">a new iPhone that will be introduced on October 4</a>, the latest from Nielsen might not be an accurate indicator of where the market might be going.</p>
