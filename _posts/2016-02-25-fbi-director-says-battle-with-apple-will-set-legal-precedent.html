<p>[ <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/hamzashaban/fbi-director-says-battle-with-apple-could-set-legal-preceden">BuzzFeed</a> ] Hamza Shaban:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I do think that whatever the judge&rsquo;s decision is in California &mdash; and I&rsquo;m sure it will be appealed no matter how it ends up &mdash; will be instructive for other courts,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And there may well be other cases that involve the same kind of phone and the same operating system.&rdquo;</blockquote></p>
<p>This is FBI Director James Comey during testimony before the House Intelligence Committee. Comey knows this isn't about just that one iPhone 5c used in San Bernardino, but a whole bunch of other iPhones the FBI can't hack today and in the future. Same kind of phone = iPhone. Same operating system = iOS.</p>
