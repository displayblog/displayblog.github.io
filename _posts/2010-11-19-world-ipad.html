<p><a href="http://digitaldaily.allthingsd.com/20101119/apple-developing-cdma-gsm-world-ipad/">All Things Digital</a>, <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/11/19/apples_next_gen_ipad_rumored_with_world_mode_gsm_cdma_radio.html">AppleInsider</a>, <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/analyst-apple-plans-to-slow-ipad-3g-production-in-favor-of-cdma-gsm-world-ipad/70358">Cult of Mac</a>: Apple is working on the iPad 2.0 and it'll be a world iPad, meaning you don't need to worry about whether the country you'll be traveling to has GSM or CDMA carriers. The world iPad with work with either. Qualcomm's chips will make this happen.</p>
<p>There is also a rumor that the iPad 2.0 will be thinner made from a single piece of metal. It might be liquid metal and/or carbon fiber reinforced. I would put my bet on a unibody construction similar to what we see in the new MacBook Airs with the unibody LCD housing.</p>
<p>Combine the programmable SIM (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/11/19/apple-programmable-sim/">Apple: Programmable SIM</a></em>) with a thinner and lighter iPad 2.0 (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/11/19/carbon-fiber-ipad/">Carbon Fiber iPad?</a></em>) in addition to the 2048x1536 pixel format (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/09/08/2011-ipad/">2011 iPad</a></em>) and the next-generation world iPad seems to be a world-beater.</p>
