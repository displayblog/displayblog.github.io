<p><a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/5297/samsung-announces-series-7-and-series-9-monitors">AnandTech</a>: Looks nice, right? Well, don't be fooled. The display is 27 inches and you'd think it would sport a 2560x1440 pixel format. But then you'd be wrong. The T27B750 'premium' Series 7 monitor packs an anemic 1920x1080, good for a resolution of 81.59 ppi. That's not all. The display technology? Without a doubt Samsung's IPS-equivalent PLS. That <em>should</em> be the answer, but no, it's a piece of crap TN. And who cares if the price is just US$599 if what you're getting looks good only when it's off.</p>
