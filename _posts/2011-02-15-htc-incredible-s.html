<p>What the heck is a Super LED? I hope HTC isn't trying to do a Samsung, who fooled a lot of people into thinking that a LED TV is something completely different than a LCD TV. There really is no such thing as a LED TV unless you want to call those huge LED billboards a TV. Same goes for Super LED: no such thing for use in a smartphone.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/02/15/htc-refreshes-android-lineup-with-incredible-s-desire-s-and-wil/">press release by HTC</a> that Engadget swiped in its entirety the Incredible S uses a Super <em>LCD</em>. I believe all LCD-based high-end smartphones have LED as a light source. So don't let anyone fool you with a nonsensical term like LED TV. Or Super LED.</p>
