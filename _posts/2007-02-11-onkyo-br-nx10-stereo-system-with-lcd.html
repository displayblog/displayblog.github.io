<p>Okyo's BR-NX10 is a very nice-looking stereo system that sports some very unique features. First, the BR-NX10 has a 80GB hard disk that allows you to rip your CDs. Second, it has a LCD display and an Ethernet port for connecting to the Internet surfing on AnyMusic and purchasing songs online.</p>

<p>It also has a USB port for PC connections or USB flash drives to grab MP3 and WMA music files. Onkyo's Vector Linear Shaping Circuitry (VLSC) audio system makes the sound crystal clear. And for all of this you'll be paying E600 (about US$780). I really like how the BR-NX10 is designed. Onkyo did a great job integrating all of that technology into a simple and sexy design. I wonder if someone can develop a hack so the BR-NX10 can work with iTunes. Just wondering...</p>
