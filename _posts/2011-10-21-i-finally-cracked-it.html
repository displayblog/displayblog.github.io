<p>Steve Jobs, as quoted in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/jobss-final-plan-an-integrated-apple-tv/2011/10/21/gIQAvhUl3L_story.html">The Washington Post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I'd like to create an integrated television set that is completely easy to use. It would be seamlessly synced with all of your devices and with iCloud. It will have the simplest user interface you could imagine. I finally cracked it.</blockquote></p>
