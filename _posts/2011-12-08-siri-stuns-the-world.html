<p><a href="http://allthingsd.com/20111208/2012-siri-is-a-stunner-amazon-is-amazin-and-security-gets-spendy/">Arik Hesseldahl, AllThingsD</a>, reports Strategic News Service CEO Mark Anderson's ten "predictions concerning what he thinks will be the dominant forces shaping the technology world in the coming year." Here's number five:</p>
<blockquote><p>Siri stuns the world. Siri, on Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s iPhone 4S, has sounded the arrival of Internet personal assistants, and the world will spend this year marveling at what Siri and its rivals can and cannot do &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; and what they can learn to do.<br />
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;I think we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll see a bunch of these things,&acirc;&euro; Anderson says. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Siri will get much better. It will learn how you learn. We&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve never seen people have long-term relationships with machines before, but it will be a long-term relationship, and she will remember everything, but make good use of it. She will know you learn better by seeing than hearing, or that it takes three times to tell you something. All those things that you have to program today should be learnable. None of that has been done yet. That creates a real friendship. And I think we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re going to start seeing personal assistants not just for everyday life, but for professions like medicine or car repair. Instead of just having Siri be everything, there will be many Siris for different contexts.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
