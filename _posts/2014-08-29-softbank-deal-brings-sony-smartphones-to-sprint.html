<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/29/us-sony-softbank-idUSKBN0GT0OT20140829">Reuters</a>: For the first time Sony smartphones will be available on Sprint, thanks to SoftBank. Good timing, too: Sony is expected to unveil its flagship smartphone &mdash; the Xperia Z3 &mdash; at IFA next week. Maybe, like Microsoft, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/04/21/sony-xperia-z2-not-good-in-the-sun/">it takes Sony three tries to get it right</a>.</p>
