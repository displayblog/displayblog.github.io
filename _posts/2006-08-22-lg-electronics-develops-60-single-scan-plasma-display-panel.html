<p>There are two basic driving schemes for plasma display panels (PDPs): single scan and dual scan addressing. All the cells on the screen are addressed before the display phase is entered in single scan addressing and requires only one set of address drivers that saves costs. In dual scan, the screen is divided into two: top and bottom, and requires two sets of drivers at the top and bottom. Although the dual scan addressing technology has more cost associated with it, address time is reduced by 50% compared to single scan allowing for more time in the display phase that leads to an increase in the number of sustain pulses applied to the PDP in the display phase. This also leads to increased peak brightness as well as power consumption and a reduction in phosphor lifetime. Single scan technology allows manufacturing cost reductions of around 20% compared to the more traditional dual scan technology.</p>
<p>LG Electronics has developed the world's first 60" single scan PDP and will begin mass production in the fourth quarter of 2006. All 42" and 50" HD PDPs from LGE that shipped starting from the second half of 2005 used single scan technology.</p>

<p>Fujitsu Hitachi Plasma (FHP) also uses single scan technology and is<br />
developing high-speed driving methods while costs are minimized. FHP's<br />
Alternate Lighting of Surface Method (ALIS) is based on single scan technology. FHP's ALIS technology increases the number of video lines, incorporates a new pixel geometry and activates alternate display lines that result in sharper pictures, smoother object edges and higher brightness than traditional driving technologies.<br />
As the screen size becomes larger, the difficulty in implementing single scan technology increases due to the limitations of addressing driver speeds.</p>
