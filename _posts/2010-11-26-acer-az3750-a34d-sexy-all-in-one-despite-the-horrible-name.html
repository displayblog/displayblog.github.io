<p><a href="http://en.akihabaranews.com/74322/desktop/acer-releases-a-new-all-in-one-desktop-computer">Akihabara News</a>: The Acer AZ3750-A34D is a well-designed all-in-one with a lot of laser-straight lines and just enough blue LED to accentuate. This Acer sports a 21.5-inch LCD with 1920x1080, 300 cd/m2 of brightness and a standard 5ms response time. It runs Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit.</p>

<p>I would hope the LCD is of the IPS variety but probably not, unfortunately. For something that looks this good I would hope future designers will see fit that what you see on it is just as good. And for that IPS is the best.</p>
<p>The Acer AZ3750-A34D looks to be geared toward anyone who wants a stylish and simple computer setup. But, with a sub-optimal LCD it might be better off as a sexy piece of high-tech furniture. I would also recommend replacing the keyboard and mouse. The 21.5-inch Acer all-in-one will be available on December 3rd for &yen;69,800. FYI, the 21.5-inch iMac might be the better choice, and Apple is having a one-day sale today where you can save $101 off of one.</p>
