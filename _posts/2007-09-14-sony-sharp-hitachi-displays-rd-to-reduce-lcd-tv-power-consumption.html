<p>On September 14, Sony, Sharp and Hitachi Displays announced a&Acirc;&nbsp;joint technology study aimed at&Acirc;&nbsp;reducing LCD TV power consumption. The three companies are&Acirc;&nbsp;targeting 2011 to&Acirc;&nbsp;develop technology that will reduce power consumption to less than 50% of current levels.&Acirc;&nbsp;One current effort that has been undergoing in the notebook market has been the transition from CCFL backlights to LED backlights to reduce power consumtpion and profile. In my opinion,&Acirc;&nbsp;a thinner and lighter device positively impacts our environment and productivity as it requires less materials to manufacture (less polution)&Acirc;&nbsp;and less effort to lug around.</p>
