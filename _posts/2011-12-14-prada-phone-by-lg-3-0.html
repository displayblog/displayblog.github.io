<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/12/14/2635625/prada-phone-by-lg-3-pictures-hands-on-preview">Vlad Savov, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was pleasantly surprised by the UI smoothness on this third Prada Phone. The white icons flow around the black and grey UI swiftly and apps open up promptly.</blockquote></p>
<p>That's a good start.</p>
<blockquote><p>For a 4.3-inch device, the Prada's 800 x 480 resolution is now a bit behind the curve, but the 8.5mm thickness is right in line with the competition.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Prada Phone by LG 3.0 packs a 800-nit 4.3-inch 800x480 NOVA Plus LCD with a resolution good for 217 ppi. An OLED display would have been perfect for this phone. The dark background means very little power consumption and if <em>black</em> is what you want OLED is the only game in town.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/02/13/prada-phone-by-lg-3-0-review/">Mat Smith, Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>LG's NOVA Plus display is a divisive beast. It's not Super AMOLED Plus, but more like a very good TFT display. Viewing angles are respectable, although we've been spoiled by IPS. LG's gone in a different direction and like on its Optimus Black; it's a very bright direction. It can blast out up to 800 nits of brightness and we can honestly say you'll have no problems reading this display in full daylight. In daily use, we kept brightness at around 50 percent, and it was hardly an issue in cloudy London. The WVGA (800 x 480) resolution will disappoint many -- count us as one of them -- and while we get that the high price does factor in that label, we're approaching the next generation of smartphones. High-definition displays are here. Fortunately, there is a Gorilla Glass coating to maintain the screen's good looks while in your pocket.</blockquote></p>
<p>The contract-free price is &Acirc;&pound;500. For that kind of coin I expect a state-of-the-art display. The Prada Phone by LG 3.0 fails to deliver in that regard.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.04.06:</em> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/6/2930002/lg-prada-phone-3-review">Aaron Souppouris, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The main problem with the display lies with its WVGA 480 x 800 resolution, which was already looking tired in Samsung's flagship Galaxy S II this time last year. Everything you see on the display could just do with being a tiny bit sharper, and there are occasions where you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll see individual pixels, most notably on the stock weather widgets clouds, which drove me insane.</blockquote></p>
<p>Prada. That fashion brand conjures up the word luxury. Well the Prada Phone 3.0's display is anything but. A premium 4.3-inch smartphone demands a Retina-class display with a pixel format of 1280x720.</p>
<blockquote><p>LG's Nova LCD technology produces an incredible amount of brightness (800 nits to be precise), but retains surprisingly deep black levels. Color reproduction and viewing angles are good, although when viewed from oblique angles the whole screen takes a slightly blueish hue.</blockquote></p>
<p>An OLED display and the high-contrast UI would have been perfect. Though the latest and greatest LCDs do a fine job of deep blacks there is no way to beat OLED's zero nits. LG fails to harness the Prada brand; the display looks like a knockoff of what could have been.</p>
