<p><a href="http://bradwallen.com/2010/11/19/why-fewer-hardware-options-are-better/">Brad W. Allen</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the <strong>majority</strong> of consumers, having fewer options to choose from means both a better buying experience and a better overall user experience. Those two things increase brand loyalty. If you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re a handset maker, don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t you want that?</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple gives you a total of three options if you want to buy an iPhone:</p>
<ul>
<li>8GB iPhone 3GS</li>
<li>16GB iPhone 4</li>
<li>32GB iPhone 4</li><br />
</ul><br />
The white iPhone 4 is coming in Spring 2011. On the other hand there are more than 70 different Android phones you can choose from. If I were in the market for an Android phone, being a display guy I would narrow that down to ones that have IPS displays and that would make it easier, but I'm glad I'm an iPhone guy. I do wish Apple had mastered the art of making the white iPhone 4 a little sooner though.</p>
