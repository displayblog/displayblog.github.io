<p>Goldman Sachs analyst Bill Shope <em>via</em> <a href="http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2011/04/19/tablets-mammoth-goldman-note-sees-apple-maintaining-lead/">Barron's</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even assuming 50% upside to the non-Apple tablet market, it is likely that Apple would still hold a majority market share. In our non-Apple upside scenario, Apple would hold 54% of the market in 2011 and 2012. To the extent that non-Apple tablets sell below our current expectations, our downside analysis implies Apple could hold as much as 74% market share in 2011 and 71% market share in 2012. We believe the downside scenario for Android shipments is more likely at this point.</blockquote></p>
<p>74%. Two iPad models. A single company. Is Apple <em>that</em> much better than everyone else?</p>
