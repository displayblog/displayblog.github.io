<p>There is a blurry photo up on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/22/iphone-4-arrives-at-walmart/">Engadget</a> showing of the retail box of the iPhone 4, supposedly at Walmart. I personally prefer the previous retail box design's 1:1 image and simplicity, but I suppose Apple wanted to emphasize the newly designed stainless steel mid-section.</p>
