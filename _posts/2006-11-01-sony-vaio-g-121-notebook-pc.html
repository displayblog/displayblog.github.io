<p>Sony's VAIO G is an ultra-light 12.1" notebook PC that weighs only 1.98 pounds or 898 grams. The 12.1" LCD has a 1024 x 768 resolution and the G sports a Celeron or Core Solo 1.06GHz U1300 or 1.2GHz U1400 CPU, integrated Intel 945GMS Express GPU, up to 80GB of HDD and up to 1.5GB of RAM. The battery is claimed to last for 6 hours and has a biometric fingerprint reader. For connectivity, the G comes with 802.11a/b/g and Bluetooth. The tiny G also has a built-in dual-layer multi-format DVD burner. Smallish gadgets come at big prices and this is not the exception: $1836 - $2093.</p>

<p>A sub-2 pound notebook PC would be welcome by anyone who travels extensively. Much like everything else with LCDs, wide is in. Everything about the G says elite, except the 4:3 12.1" LCD.</p>
