<p><a href="http://nautil.us/issue/4/the-unlikely/paper-versus-pixel">Nicholas Carr, Nautilus</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The physical presence of the printed pages, and the ability to flip back and forth through them, turns out to be important to the mind&acirc;&euro;&trade;s ability to navigate written works, particularly lengthy and complicated ones. We quickly develop a mental map of the contents of a printed text, as if its argument or story were a voyage unfolding through space. [...]</p>
<p>The spatial memories seem to translate into more immersive reading and stronger comprehension. A recent experiment conducted with young readers in Norway found that, with both expository and narrative works, people who read from a printed page understand a text better than those who read the same material on a screen. The findings are consistent with a series of other studies on the process of reading.</blockquote></p>
<p>Want to better comprehend a book? Read the printed version. Sounds like solid advice. But this isn't going to be easy.</p>
<p>I read most of my books on my Samsung Galaxy Note 4. I 'carry' around about a dozen books and I read a bit here and a bit there. I highlight, jot down notes, and can search them, instantly. I wouldn't be able to do this with printed books.</p>
<p>But if I take a moment to think about why I read, I realize I read to comprehend, and if I can comprehend better by reading a printed book well, then I should read printed books.</p>
<p>Now where can I find hard bound books at dirt cheap prices? I can't borrow them because I need to underline and jot down notes while I read. I find I comprehend better this way. I also want hardcover books because they are bigger and have more room for notes, feel better in my hands because of their generally better quality paper and binding, and because they last longer; I'd like to keep them around for a while.</p>
<p>Anybody know if there's a service that automatically prints and binds hardcover books from RSS feeds? Say, 100 starred articles for US$20?</p>
