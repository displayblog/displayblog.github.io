<p>Jessica E. Vascellaro, reporting for The Wall Street Journal:</p>
<blockquote><p>Google Inc. has designed a cellphone it plans to sell directly to consumers as soon as next year... The phone is called the Nexus One and is being manufactured for Google by HTC Corp.... The move could alienate wireless carriers and handset makers that offer Android phones and do not want to compete with Google.</blockquote><br />
