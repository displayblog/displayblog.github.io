<p><center>iPhone &rarr; iPhone 3G &rarr; iPhone 3GS &rarr; iPhone 4 &rarr; ?</center></p>
<p>There doesn't seem to be a clear algorithm for how Apple adds suffixes to the iPhone. I really like the first one: iPhone. How simple is that? The second version with the 3G suffix was so added because it took advantage of 3G data networks. Fair enough, but I thought it was too "suffixy." Apple went off the cliff with the next one: the iPhone 3GS. The 'S' stood for speed.</p>
<p>Then the iPhone 4 came out. If there were any semblance of a systematic nomenclature for iPhone suffixes the iPhone 4 threw it all out. To the best of my knowledge the '4' simply means 4th generation.</p>
<p>Apple couldn't use 4<em>G</em> since 4G networks weren't available when it was introduced. Although Clear, Verizon, and T-Mobile claim they have 4G networks now, they are lying to you. These new networks are not technically 4G, though they <em>are</em> faster than regular 3G. The next iPhone will certainly take advantage of these advanced non-4G networks. So, what will Apple call the next iPhone?</p>
<p>iPhone 4S, 'S' for speed.</p>
<p>But if I had it my way, I would go back to the original and simply name it iPhone, and keep it that way.</p>
