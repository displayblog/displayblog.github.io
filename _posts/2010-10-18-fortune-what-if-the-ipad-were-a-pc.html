<p>Deutsche Bank's Chris Whitmore on <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/10/18/what-if-the-ipad-were-a-pc/">Fortune</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Exclude the iPad, and Apple's personal computer sales grew 24% year-over-year. Include them, and Apple's unit sales soared roughly 250%... When the iPad is part of the mix, Apple's share of the U.S. PC market is about 25%. That makes it the market leader, having gained a remarkable 18 points in the space of two quarters.</blockquote></p>
<p>I think the iPad is something other than a PC, a post-PC.</p>
