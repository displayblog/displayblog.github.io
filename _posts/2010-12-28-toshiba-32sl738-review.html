<p><a href="http://www.trustedreviews.com/tvs/review/2010/12/24/Toshiba-32SL738/p1">TrustedReviews</a> gave the Toshiba 32SL738 just 6/10 for 2D picture quality:</p>
<blockquote><p>The wheels come off, however, when you ask the 32SL738 to deal with any predominantly dark scenes. The main reason for this is the recurrence yet again of what&acirc;&euro;&trade;s becoming an unfortunate Toshiba trademark: serious backlight inconsistency. A large chunk of the top edge of our test sample looked considerably brighter than the rest of the picture during dark scenes, with a lesser patch of trouble evident in the bottom left corner.</blockquote></p>
<p>The 32SL738 sports edge-lit LED backlights, but they seem to be inconsistent, which is terrible.</p>
