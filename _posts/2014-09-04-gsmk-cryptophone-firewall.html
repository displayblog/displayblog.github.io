<blockquote><p>GSMK&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <a href="http://www.cryptophone.de/en/products/mobile/cp500/">CryptoPhone 500</a>, a high-end phone that costs more than $3,000 and combines a Samsung Galaxy S3 handset with the CryptoPhone operating system, offers strong end-to-end encryption along with a specially hardened Android operating system that offers more security than other Android phones and the <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US20140004829">patented baseband firewall</a> that can alert customers when a rogue tower has connected to their phone or turned off the mobile network&acirc;&euro;&trade;s standard encryption.</blockquote></p>
<p>CryptoPhone users have reported 19 rogue towers spread throughout the U.S. Protection against rogue cell towers should be standard on all devices that depend on cellular connectivity for normal operations.</p>
