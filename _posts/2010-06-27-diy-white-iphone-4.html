I am not yet convinced that an iPhone 4 is a must-buy. I'm concerned about the antenna reception issue and the yellowish discoloration on the otherwise beautiful Retina Display. Nonetheless, I am waiting for the white version. Hopefully Apple will get both of the problems licked by the time the white iPhone 4 comes out. Well, the folks over at <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/27/white-iphone-4-early-diy-edition-with-a-touch-of-black/">Engadget</a> didn't want to wait: they took a white front cover, a prototype white back cover (model number XXXXX), a Retina Display, and an <a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone-4-Teardown/3130/1">iFixit</a> teardown guide and got to work. The result is a white iPhone 4 with a black home button. Almost as good as the real deal, almost.</p>
