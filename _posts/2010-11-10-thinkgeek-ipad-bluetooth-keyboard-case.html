<blockquote><p>In use, the iPad rests on a built in stand in a horizontal orientation which makes the whole package look and work almost like a netbook. The keyboard itself has a silicone cover that will resist the occasional caffeinated spillage of your choice and provides noticeable tactile feedback. </blockquote></p>
<p>There are function keys that even the Apple's version doesn't have: Home, Volume, iPod Controls, Search. The Lithium Ion battery used in the keyboard lasts 90 hours of continuous use. For just $59.99 the ThinkGeek iPad Bluetooth Keyboard Case looks to be a bargain.</p>
