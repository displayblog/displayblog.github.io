<p>Both are CCFL manufacturers and both are located in Taiwan. Wellypower will have a 20 million unit per month capacity by the end of 2006 while Delta Electronics Inc., it&#39;s rival, announced plans to increase total capacity to 19.5 million units by the end of this year. Wellypower has strong ties with AUO and currently has 20 manufacturing lines producing over 10 million CCFLs a month. On the other hand, Delta has 12 manufacturing lines producing 6 million per month, located in Taoyuan, Taiwan. The new production lines (about 18) will be located in China that will bolster its production capacity. Delta is currently researching a mercury-free backlight solution with CMO. Mercury-free BLU solutions are important because of ROHS that becomes effective July 1, 2006.</p>
