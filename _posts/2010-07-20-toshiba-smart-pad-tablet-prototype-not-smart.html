<p>Managing director of Toshiba Australia Mark Whittard showed off the company's Smart Pad tablet prototype. According to <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/07/20/toshiba">PC Authority</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Refusing to be drawn on specifics of the prototype, he did confirm that Toshiba would be releasing both Android and Windows 7 based tablets. The company is aiming at launching at least one of these products in the September-October timeframe.</blockquote></p>
<p>I guess the OS will be a mystery until the Smart Pad is launched. Just dual-boot! One more thing: that prototype looks very similar to Apple's iPad. And that's surprising. So far HP was the only company that has been exceptionally practiced at copying Apple's industrial designs. I guess I'll need to add Toshiba to the list of gifted copycats.</p>
