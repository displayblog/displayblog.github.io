<blockquote><p>According to IBM, it is Apple mobile devices that drive mobile sales, and Apple users spend more money per order, as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Black Friday. On average, Apple iOS users spent $127.92 per order, compared to $105.20 per order for Android devices. iOS devices garnered 28.2 percent of all online traffic compared to 11.4 percent for Android. iOS sales accounted for 18.1 percent of all online sales, compared to 3.5 percent for Android.</li>
<li>Cyber Monday. On average, Apple iOS users spent $120.29 per order, compared to $106.70 per order for Android. iOS traffic reached 22.4 percent of all online traffic, compared to 9.1 percent for Android. iOS sales reached 14.5 percent of all online sales, compared to 2.6 percent for Android.</li><br />
</ul></blockquote></p>
<p>Not surprising iPhone and iPad users spent more, but Amazon Kindle Fire's share of Android online sales on Black Friday and Cyber Monday was probably substantial.</p>
