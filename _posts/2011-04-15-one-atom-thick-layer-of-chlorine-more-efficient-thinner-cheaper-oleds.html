<p><a href="http://mse.utoronto.ca/news/features/20110414.htm?DateTime=634383867600000000&PageMode=View">Department of Material Science and Engineering, University of Toronto</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Primary researchers Michael G. Helander (PhD Candidate & Vanier Canada Graduate Scholar), Zhibin Wang (PhD Candidate), and led by Professor Zheng-Hong Lu, in the Department of Materials Science & Engineering at the University of Toronto, have found a simple method of using chlorine to drastically reduce traditional OLED device complexity and dramatically improve its efficiency all at the same time. By engineering a one-atom thick sheet of chlorine onto the surface of an existing industry-standard electrode material (indium tin oxide, ITO) found in today&acirc;&euro;&trade;s flat-panel displays, these researchers have created a medium that allows for efficient electrical transport while eliminating the need for several costly layers found in traditional OLED devices.</blockquote></p>
<p>One-atom thick layer of chlorine allows for efficient electrical transport in OLEDs. OLED display manufacturers like Samsung are building large display fabrication plants to improve the economics of cost. What Professor Lu and his team have found will make future OLEDs simpler to produce, thinner than before, and cheaper, too.</p>
