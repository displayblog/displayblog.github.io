<p>AVING posted up some very nice pictures of the new Korean Air Airbus A380 jumbo plane. There seems to be at least 7 central portrait LCDs with another for one of the pilots and then a few more smaller ones. I know these LCDs are very expensive due to their ultra-tough specifications: they are firstly physically ruggedized (durable front), must be able to see them when there is direct sunlight and in darkness (transflective, the best there is), must be operational in very cold and very hot temperatures (most likely LED lighting solutions instead of CCFL), minuscule EMI interference with other electronic components, etc. The cockpit looks very high tech and interesting.</p>
