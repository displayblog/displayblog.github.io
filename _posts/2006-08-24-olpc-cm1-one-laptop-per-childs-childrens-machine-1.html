<p>So that's the official name: CM1. Not very creative, but is simple and to the point. It's for children. The display is a 7.5" with 1200 x 900 resolution--a bit of an odd size and resolution, which added to the cost of manufacturing. It is just my guess, but sticking to a standard size and resolution would have made the display a bit cheaper. But the dual-mode capability of the display is probably what made it most expensive: one for video and one for 2D.
