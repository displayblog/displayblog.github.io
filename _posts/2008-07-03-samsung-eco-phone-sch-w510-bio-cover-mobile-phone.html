<p><a href="http://www.akihabaranews.com/en/news_details.php?id=16345">Akihabara News</a>, <a href="http://www.mobilewhack.com/samsung-sch-w510-and-sgh-f268-phones/">Mobilewhack.com</a>: The Samsung Eco Phone SCH-W510, has a nickname: Bio Cover Phone. The reason? The cover is made from bioplastic material, which in turn is made from corn starch. The manufacturing process is an environmentally friendly one and does not use brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). In addition, there are no Mercury, Lead or Cadmium. The SCH-W510 is quite sensitive to the environment and seems like it lives up to both its name of Eco Phone and nickname of Bio Cover Phone. The display seems to be about 2.2" to 2.4" in size and the pixel format should be 240 x 320, just a guess. I am not thinking that it is touch-enabled.</p>

<p>Mobile phones are used like fashion accessories, especially in Asian countries like South Korea and Japan. So for many teenagers and slightly older folks, the lifetime of a fairly high-end mobile phone is at most 2 years, and generally just a single year. With more than one billion mobile phones to be sold in 2008, that's a lot of wasted electronics. Where do the so-yesterday mobile phones go? Unfortunately, most of them go to the dump. There are a lot of efforts to recycle the parts and even reuse them, but I am not sure if recycle and reuse percentages are that high. With the advent of Samsung's Eco Phone, I think it is safe to say that being friendly to the environment is becoming more and more important to major corporations. I am glad to see this trend started by one of the largest mobile phone manufacturers in the world. I hope Nokia, LG, Motorola, RIM, Palm and Apple move toward this direction soon.</p>
