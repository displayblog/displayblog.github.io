<p><a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/08/16/apple-boss-tries-to-gut-retail-operation/">Jim Dalrymple, The Loop</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This has the stench of a man looking to make a name for himself, not someone that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s doing what&acirc;&euro;&trade;s best for Apple or more importantly, its customers. To take one of the most heralded retail experiences in the world and gut it, stripping it of everything that makes an Apple store what it is, just doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t make sense.</blockquote></p>
<p>Browett's DNA is using cost-cutting to drive profits, corporate and otherwise.</p>
