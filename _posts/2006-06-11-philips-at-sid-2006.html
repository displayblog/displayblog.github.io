<p>Philips showcased many TV technologies at SID 2006 including its Aptura lighting technology. By using a new backlight system that incorporates HCFLs (hot cathod fluorescent lamps) instead of the traditional CCFLs, light output is increased as well as durability while having lower cost. Philips also showed a 120Hz (double that of current 60Hz) scanning TV with HCFLs that use blinking backlights to minimize motion blur. Also, an active backlight system (Deep Dynamic Dimming, D-3) that uses brightness levels of video content reduces power consumption but more importantly increases contrast ratio thus improving front screen color performance.</p>
