<p>Nintendo president <a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/423036/iwata-nintendo-games-on-rival-platforms-would-only-be-a-short-term-fix/">Satoru Iwata</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What I believe is that Nintendo is a very unique company, because it does its business by designing and introducing people to hardware and software - by integrating them, we can be unique. And because we have hardware and software developers in the same building, they stimulate each other.</blockquote></p>
