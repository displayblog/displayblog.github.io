<blockquote>
<p>Unlike the other RGBG PenTile which adorned AMOLED displays before Super AMOLED Plus swung around, I find RGBW much easier to stomach and completely readable when presented with black on white UIs. Colors still have visible grain, as do some UI elements, but the Droid 3&acirc;&euro;&trade;s 4" display makes this considerably less noticeable than the same resolution on the Droid X2. Only on bright colors is that extra space due to the fourth subpixel readily visible, and thanks to our color-specific visual acuity, greens are the most visible.</p><br />

<p>The Motorola Droid 3 sports a RGBW PenTile Matrix 4.0-inch LCD with a 960x540 qHD pixel format.</p></p>
