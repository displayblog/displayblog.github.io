<blockquote><p>As if all of that wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t enough, Apple Music gave me one more kick in the head. Over the weekend, I turned off Apple Music and it took large chunks of my purchased music with it. Sadly, many of the songs were added from CDs years ago that I no longer have access to. Looking at my old iTunes Match library, before Apple Music, I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m missing about 4,700 songs. At this point, I just don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t care anymore, I just want Apple Music off my devices.</p>
<p>I trusted my data to Apple and they failed. I also failed by not backing up my library before installing Apple Music. I will not make either of those mistakes again.</p>
<p>I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m going to listen to what&acirc;&euro;&trade;s left of my music library, and try to figure out all of the songs I have to buy again. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll also download Spotify and reactivate the account I cancelled with them a couple of weeks ago.</blockquote></p>
<p>The latest way to listen to music is to have a computer (smartphone, tablet, laptop, desktop), a music app, and stream your music. Some streaming services have ads and you pay a monthly fee to get rid of them. Others limit some capabilities and you pay to restore them. When you listen to music this way you're paying for the <em>experience</em> of listening to music, unlimited music yes, but you own nothing.</p>
<p>Like Dalrymple I have music ripped from CDs. Lots of them. When I first signed up for Apple's Music Match service about a year ago, I thought it was a great idea. Then I found Google Play Music that did the same thing, for free. Google Play Music lets me stream my own music on my desktop, laptop, or smartphone. I seldom stream music I don't own, because I like listening to the music I've collected over the years. Makes sense: we collect what we like. If for some reason I trusted Apple with all of my music &mdash; I never did, and I now know I should never &mdash; deleted those off of my drives thinking my music is safe with Apple, and then Apple wiped thousands of them (probably because of some dude's programming error), I would be furious.</p>
<p>My trust in Apple continues to erode. (My 2009 MacBook Pro started acting erratically the moment I upgraded to OS X 10.10 Yosemite; despite many patches and fixes it still hangs whenever it wants. It is hot and the fans spin furiously; the only way to shut it up is to long press the power button. The cheaper and older white MacBook, white iMac, and Mac mini work just fine; I will not upgrade them to Yosemite though.) Another thing I won't try: Apple Music.</p>
