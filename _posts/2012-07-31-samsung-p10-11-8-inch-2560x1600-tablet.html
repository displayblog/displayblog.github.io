<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/30/3205118/samsung-p10-11-8-inch-retina-tablet">Chris Ziegler, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Court documents made public in the epic Apple v. Samsung trial that kicked off in California today reveal that Samsung is working on a tablet codenamed "P10" that would include LTE connectivity and an 11.8-inch display at 2560 x 1600 (WQXGA) resolution.</blockquote></p>
<p>Assuming a RGB subpixel 11.8-inch LCD the resolution would be 256 ppi, almost equaling the new iPad (3). Impressive.</p>
