<p style="text-align: center;">Specifications for the Sony BRAVIA KDL-55XBR8 LCD TV can be found <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/06/05/sony-kdl-55xbr8-55-1080p-lcd-tv/">here</a>.</p></p>
<p>cnet reviews has given <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sony">Sony</a>'s BRAVIA KDL-55XBR8 4 out of 5 stars in a review that states the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=55"">55"</a> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=rgb-led-backlight">RGB LED</a> backlit <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a> to be "mighty close" to the "best HDTV" they have tested so far. I believe the updated <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=kuro">KURO</a> takes the title of best HDTV. The review points to the KDL-55XBR8 having black levels that have not been seen before on LCD TVs. Color fidelity was top notch, probably thanks to the RGB LEDs. Not everything was excellent. Off-angle image quality suffered. This is probably due to the fact that the LCD panel is of the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=s-pva">S-PVA</a> (Super Patterned Vertical Alignment) variety where contrast ratio drops a bit (more so than S-IPS, Super In Plane Switching) at off angles. cnet also docked the KDL-55XBR8 for having non-removable speakers that extend to the side. I must say those speakers don't look all that great. It would have been better if they were integrated. Another negative point was the extremely high price of $6999.99 for a 55" LCD TV. Of course, this isn't a regular 55", but it still is one very expensive LCD TV.</p>
