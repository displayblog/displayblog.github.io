<p><a href="http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/Recovering_from_information_overload_2735">Derek Dean and Caroline Webb, McKinsey Quarterly</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We tend to believe that by doing several things at the same time we can better handle the information rushing toward us and get more done. What&acirc;&euro;&trade;s more, multitasking&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;interrupting one task with another&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;can sometimes be fun. Each vibration of our favorite high-tech e-mail device carries the promise of potential rewards. Checking it may provide a welcome distraction from more difficult and challenging tasks. It helps us feel, at least briefly, that we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve accomplished something&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;even if only pruning our e-mail in-boxes. Unfortunately, current research indicates the opposite: multitasking unequivocally damages productivity.</blockquote></p>
