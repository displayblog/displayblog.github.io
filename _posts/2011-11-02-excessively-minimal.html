<p><a href="http://michaelschechter.me/excessively-minimal/">Michael Schechter</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Give it a try, but be careful not to take minimalism on as some kind of rigid underlying philosophy rather than what it really is, a resulting aesthetic of getting yourself organized. Don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t let yourself obsess on less for less sake, you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re often missing the true potential of a minimal approach: getting the unnecessary out of the way in order to let the important take center stage.</blockquote></p>
<p>One of the cool things about simplifying and minimizing is the important automatically and naturally crystallize as more and more unnecessary things are banished.</p>
