<p>I was having a conversation with someone in the TV industry and there seems to be some interest in developing a 22" LCD TV. Now this would compete directly against 23" LCD TVs that are already out there. But, there might be a trend here. For instance, in the monitor world, the 22" wide size is garnering a lot of interest. With the 1680 x 1050 pixel format, fonts are large enough for comfortable viewing. Of course the 22" LCD TV will not have that pixel format and instead would be 1366 x 768. The display would certainly use a TN+Film technology to reduce costs. For individual use in a home-office, children's rooms, or in your own bedroom a 22" 1366 x 768 LCD TV might be a nice little size. The price would certainly have to be around $299, at most. And with an ATSC tuner.</p>
<p>Oh, just a side note: Vizio's 42" 1080p LCD TV is just $1,199 at <a href="http://www.costco.com/Browse/Product.aspx?Prodid=11225206&amp;whse=BC&amp;topnav=&amp;browse=&amp;lang=en-US">Costco</a>. In my opinion, along with Syntax (with the Olevia brand), Vizio is a great bargain because the company procures panels from LG.Philips LCD (LPL). LPL's display technology is IPS, a technology widely known to be one of the best for good color fidelity and wide viewing angle.</p>
