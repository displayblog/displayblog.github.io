<p>BenQ claims its V2400W is the world's slimmest 24" LCD monitor and says that it is 21% thinner at just 2.44" than any other. It is about time. I've purchased a 24" LCD monitor before and I must say I was a little surprised to see how porky it was. I'm referring to <a href="http://displayblog.wordpress.com/2007/12/22/lg-l246wp-bn-24-lcd-monitor/">LG's L246WP-BN</a>. How much exactly is 21% thinner? Well, since most specifications are 'with base stand' I can't really figure out how thick these guys are. My best guess is around 3". So 21% thinner would be around 0.62". 0.62"? I guess that's significant. Make it just 1" thick and I'll get a little more excited. There are 42" LCD TVs getting close to that thickness or should I say thinness...</p>
<p>The 4000:1 dynamic contrast ratio is very good. The 2ms response time is super fast. The brightness at 250 cd/m2? Hmm, not too bright. 160/160 viewing angles?!? Now this is terrible. To trim costs and to get a better price to you (hopefully), BenQ is using a TN+Film LCD technology. This is fine if you're a gamer or just a regular monitor user that looks at the LCD dead-on, but if you want color and brightness to be rock solid at the sides, I'd look elsewhere. There will be considerable color shift if you go off-axis. And speaking of off-axis, the stand is to the left and then the base, to compensate, is longer on the right. I'd rather have them in the middle and the buttons too.</p>
