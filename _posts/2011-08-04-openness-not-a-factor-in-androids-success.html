<p>Ryan Paul, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2011/08/study-android-is-least-open-of-open-source-mobile-platforms.ars">Ars Technica</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The report contends that greater openness generally leads to greater success among open source software projects. At the same time, it acknowledges that Android's popularity contradicts that conclusion. The Android "paradox" is discussed at length in the report; it suggests that "Google's financial muscle" and engineering resources, rather than openness, have driven Android's success.</blockquote></p>
<p>The report is VisionMobile's 45-page <a href="http://www.visionmobile.com/research.php#OGI"><em>Open Governance Index</em></a>.</p>
