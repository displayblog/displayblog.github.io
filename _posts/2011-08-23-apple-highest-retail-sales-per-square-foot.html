<blockquote><p>It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not surprising Apple leads the pack, as there have been numerous articles such as this, but it is quite shocking by how far ahead of the competition they are, especially considering the company only has 10 years of retail experience.</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple posted US$5626 retail sales per square foot in the last four quarters. Second was Tiffany & Co. with $2974; third was Coach with $1820.</p>
