<p>AU Optronics (AUO) developed a 65-inch 3D LCD and expects to enter volume production in the second half of 2010. After watching Avatar in 3D earlier this morning I must say 3D is here to say. I look forward to massive 3D LCD TVs and a whole bunch of them line Best Buy, CostCo and Walmart stores in Christmas 2010.
