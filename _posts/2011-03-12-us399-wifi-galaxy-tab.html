<blockquote><p>Priced at $399, this seems like a decent deal, but aren&acirc;&euro;&trade;t we all positive that it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s too late for the GTab at this point?  We know that the 3G version was a disaster, haven&acirc;&euro;&trade;t heard anything about the 4G version since CES, and with Tegra 2 devices coming out in waves over the next couple of months, I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d say that this version of the GTab will likely be another dust collector.</blockquote></p>
<p>Too little, too late. $399 is the price of the first generation iPad. Just a wild guess, but I have a feeling Apple will make available the older iPad for a bit longer than expected.</p>
