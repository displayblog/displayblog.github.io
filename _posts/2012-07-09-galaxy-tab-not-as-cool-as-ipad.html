<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-09/samsung-wins-u-k-apple-ruling-over-not-as-cool-galaxy-tablet.html">Kit Chellel, Bloomberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The design for three Galaxy tablets doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t infringe Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s registered design, Judge Colin Birss said today in London in a court fight between the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s two biggest makers of smartphones. Consumers aren&acirc;&euro;&trade;t likely to get the tablet computers mixed up, he said.</p>
<p>The Galaxy tablets &acirc;&euro;&oelig;do not have the same understated and extreme simplicity which is possessed by the Apple design,&acirc;&euro; Birss said. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;They are not as cool.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>Amusing, but just because a design is not exactly the same as the one it is copying does not mean it is not copying. I'm disappointed in Samsung overall. The company has so much resources, so much potential, yet all it came up with is the Galaxy Tab, a modified iPad. Samsung and other hardware manufacturers need to get beyond their Apple-centric myopic view of design and start innovating. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2012/06/18/microsoft-surface/">Ironically Microsoft, a predominantly software company, has brought about more hardware innovation in the tablet space than hardware companies like Samsung</a>.</p>
