<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/02/exclusive-google-nexus-one-hands-on-video-and-first-impressio/">Engadget</a>: Joshua Topolsky got a hold of the Nexus One and posted up a video of his initial experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is fast.</li>
<li>Pictures look "pretty decent" coming out of the 5MP camera.</li>
<li>Thinner than the iPhone.</li>
<li>Much better design and feel compared to the Droid.</li>
<li>More responsive and accurate keyboard.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>One thing I must mention again is the 3.7-inch AMOLED display on the Nexus One. I haven't seen it with my own eyes but I believe it will be <em>significantly</em> better than the iPhone's 3.5-inch LCD. If you are not inclined to unlock your iPhone and move on over to T-Mobile because of your experience with AT&amp;T in your area, the Nexus One looks to be one very good option.</p>
