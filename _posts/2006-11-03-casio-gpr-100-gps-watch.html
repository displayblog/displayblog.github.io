<p>Casio's GPR-100 is the world's smallest GPS-enabled wristwatch, according to the company. The display, due to the small size, will not display maps, latitude, or longitude data. The pixel format is only 49 x 72 and gives you information such as time, speed, mileage and pace. Another downside to the GPR-100 is the dismal 2-hour battery life. If the unit is on low-power status, the battery can last up to 4.3 hours. And it will take about 3 hours to charge the battery so make sure to do that when you're going to sleep, every day.</p>

<p>So the apparent target customer is someone who likes to jog and want to know the performance metrics, but only for 2 hours. The GPR-100 has some other watch-like features such as a fully automatic calendar, worldwide times that include 141 cities, a stopwatch with memory function, a timer, an alarm, etc. Although bulk can be a distractor for those on the run, the 2-hour limit might be the limiting factor for folks who like to run more than 2 hours.</p>
