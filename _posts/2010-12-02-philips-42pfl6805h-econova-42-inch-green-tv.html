<blockquote><p>For thanks to a specially designed edge LED lighting system, the set can run on just 40W. This is obviously a best-case scenario, with the screen&acirc;&euro;&trade;s brightness output at its lowest. But even so, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s still more than twice as economical as the best efforts of the previous greenest TVs we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve come across, Sony&acirc;&euro;&trade;s WE5 series.</blockquote></p>
<p>The 42PFL6805H Econova is definitely green and sips less power than anything else out there.</p>
<blockquote><p>[...] the Econova just gives you a straight choice between mostly excellent picture quality and a respectably but not spectacularly low power consumption, and reduced picture quality but ground-breakingly low power consumption.</blockquote></p>
<p>Of course, the best option would be to watch less TV.</p>
