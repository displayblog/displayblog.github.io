<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/21/5533914/spec-sheet-sonys-project-morpheus-takes-on-oculus-rift">Valentina Palladino, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sony's first entry into the VR world matches the Oculus Rift on many fronts: Project Morpheus also has a 1080p display, although it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s LCD and not OLED, and has a slightly smaller field of view of 90 degrees. Verge reporter Adi Robertson <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/19/5526730/sony-morpheus-vr-headset-compares-well-to-oculus-rift">noted</a> that Morpheus&acirc;&euro;&trade; screen is slightly blurrier than the Rift's, and it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s unclear whether Sony could achieve the same low persistence technique Oculus can using its current LCD screen.</blockquote></p>
<p>One of the advantages OLED has over LCD is response time: OLED is <em>much</em> faster. I haven't had the pleasure, or displeasure, of wearing one of these VR headsets, but I would think one of the most important technical requirements for a pleasant, immersive experience is for information on the displays to update as fast as possible. So if you want to make a VR headset that people will actually want to use there is only one possible choice for the display, and it is OLED. There are, of course, some disadvantages to using OLED displays, but those disadvantages are not deal-breakers; a slightly slower display that results in blurry updates might very well be a deal breaker, especially if the additional milliseconds or microseconds lead to less than full immersion. But maybe the response times of the LCDs used in Sony's Project Morpheus is good enough.</p>
