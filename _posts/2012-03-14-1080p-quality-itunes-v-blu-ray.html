<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/guides/2012/03/the-ars-itunes-1080p-vs-blu-ray-shootout.ars">Iljitsch van Beijnum, Ars Technica</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was surprised to see how close the iTunes 1080p download comes to Blu-ray, considering that it's only a fraction of the file size. And let's be honest: there are lots of Blu-ray titles that look much worse than this iTunes download. But despite an impressive effort by Apple, Blu-ray still reigns king when it comes to image quality.</blockquote></p>
<p>The ticket: iTunes 1080p video content on DVD.</p>
