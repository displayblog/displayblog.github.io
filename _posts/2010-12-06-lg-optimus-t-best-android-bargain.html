<p><a href="http://www.laptopmag.com/review/cellphones/lg-optimus-t.aspx?page=1#axzz174s3KqkV">Laptop</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Optimus T's 3.2-inch touchscreen has a resolution of 480 x 320 pixels. Though not as sharp as competing devices such as the Motorola Defy (a pleasantly high 854 x 480) it's on a par with the Motorola Droid Pro. The screen, while small, was bright enough to see in daylight without any trouble. If conditions change, you'll have to set the brightness manually since the Optimus T lacks an ambient light sensor.</blockquote></p>
<p>The LG Optimus T has a decent display. The lack of an ambient light sensor doesn't bother me one bit: I turn off automatic brightness on my iPhone 4 anyway. And the verdict?</p>
<blockquote><p>Quite well equipped for a smart phone this affordable, the LG Optimus T is a great choice for bargain hunters. Its low price of $29 (free for the black version), solid design, and ease of use will appeal to smart phone newbies.</blockquote></p>
