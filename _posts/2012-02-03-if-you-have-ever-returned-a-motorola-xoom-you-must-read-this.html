<p><a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120203/motorola-act-now-and-well-include-the-previous-owners-personal-data-on-your-refurbished-xoom-free/">John Paczkowski</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The company said today that 100 of the 6,200 it sold through Woot.com between October and December of 2011 may not have been properly reformatted.</p>
<p>In other words, they still contained the personal information of their previous owners &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; everything from e-mail and social networking passwords to photos and documents.</blockquote></p>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>
