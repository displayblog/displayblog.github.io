<p>Anton Wahlman, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/htc-one-dont-drop-100000508.html">The Street</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>On the hardware side, I don't like this HTC One at all. Its greatest sin is that it feels like it's about to slip out of your hand any second, and what's worse than that?</blockquote></p>
<p>Metal is more slippery than plastic. Butterfingers: caveat emptor.</p>
