<p>Arisawa Manufacturing Co., Seiko Epson Corp., Texas Instruments Inc. (TI), and JVC have teamed up to promote the features and advantages of micro device display projection (MDDP) TVs by establishing the Micro Device Display Consortium (MDDPC). In addition to the founding members mentioned above, 3M, Luminus Devices, Samsung Japan, SCRAM have joined as endorsing members. Micro-display devices include digital light processing (DLP), liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS), and LCD rear projection. For instance, TI makes DLP chips, JVC uses LCoS technology for its D-ILA (Digital Direct Drive Image Light Amplifier) chip, and <a href="http://displayblog.com/?p=445">Seiko Epson makes high temperature polysilicon displays (HTPS)</a>.</p>

<p>MMDP TVs are only popular in the US where there is ample room in the homes but the folks in the US seem to like larger things compared to the rest of the world. But just because MMDP TVs are bigger, doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t mean it guzzles gas like SUVs. MMDP TVs generally consume less power and according to <a href="http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=OAS5DTFVVJGV0QSNDLOSKHSCJUNN2JVN?articleID=193003989&amp;pgno=2">EETimes</a>, MMDP TVs consume only 200W from 40&acirc;&euro;&sup3;-70&acirc;&euro;&sup3; sizes. Power consumption stays pretty much the same because the same 100W-class lamp is used to light up the display. Plasma TVs on the other can consume up to 600W for a 60&acirc;&euro;&sup3; model. Despite these qualities, MMDP TVs are not popular in Japan, South Korea, China and simply the rest of the world. The reason is that MMDP TVs are generally larger in screen size than LCD TVs or plasma TVs. Also they are deeper, making it difficult to fit in smaller rooms, typical of Asian homes and apartments. The EETimes article states a 30cm depth, but that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s still 3x - 4x deeper than LCDs or plasmas. If you have the room, go for one of these big units that are fairly affordable up to 60&acirc;&euro;&sup3;-70&acirc;&euro;&sup3;. If you don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have the room, you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll need to spend a bit more money for the slim feature.</p>
