<p><a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/designer-starck-reveals-revolutionary-apple-project-131842550.html">AFP</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Indeed, we have a big project together that will be out in eight months," Starck told France Info radio, declining to comment further because of what he called California-based Apple's "secrecy cult".</p>
<p>The 63-year-old designer did however say that the project was "fairly, if not very, revolutionary".</blockquote></p>
<p>Revolutionary. That seems to imply it's not a new iPhone, iPod, iPad, or Mac. What could it be? A TV perhaps?</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.04.13:</em> Nope, no TV. The answer according to <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120413/apple-we-dont-know-what-philippe-starck-is-talking-about">John Paczkowski, AllThingsD</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Prior to his death, <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/125100/steve-jobs-was-designing-his-own-super-yacht/">Apple CEO Steve Jobs was working with Starck on a yacht</a>. And this is very likely the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;fairly, if not very, revolutionary&acirc;&euro;¬ù project he was talking about. <a href="http://www.charterworld.com/news/steve-jobs-iyacht-luxury-feadship-superyacht">To be built by luxury superyacht builder Feadship</a>, the yacht is believed to have a very minimalist and sleek design with a main feature being 40 foot long glass walls. And Starck has been involved in its design.</blockquote></p>
<p>It's not an Apple product; it's a Steve Jobs product.</p>
