<blockquote><p>It does two things: wraps snugly round your Apple Wireless Keyboard, ensuring it doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t scratch, or get scratched by, other objects in your bag. Unfolded, the lid becomes a prop for your iPad in portrait or landscape mode, thanks to a couple of ingenious folds and a simple hook-and-loop fastener.</blockquote></p>
<p>If you own the Apple Wireless Keyboard you must have been searching high and low for a case, with a reasonable price. The Incase Origami Workstation is both a case for your keyboard and a prop for your iOS device. This is just the thing you've been waiting for. I'm thinking of using it with my iPhone. <a href="http://goincase.com/products/detail/origami-workstation-cl57934/3">Incase sells it for US$29.95</a>.</p>
