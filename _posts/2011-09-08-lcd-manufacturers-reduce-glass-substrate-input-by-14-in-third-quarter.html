<p><a href="http://www.displaysearch.com/cps/rde/xchg/displaysearch/hs.xsl/110908_tft_lcd_panel_makers_to_reduce_glass_input_in_q3_11.asp">DisplaySearch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[...] global TFT LCD glass input peaked in Q2&acirc;&euro;&trade;11 at a record 14.2 million square meters per month. However, global glass input will be reduced to 12.2 million square meters per month in Q3&acirc;&euro;&trade;11, a 14% drop Q/Q, and 5% growth Y/Y. As the market outlook is still unclear, panel makers are planning to maintain input at 12 million square meters per month in Q4&acirc;&euro;&trade;11.</blockquote></p>
<p>All applications experienced a Q/Q drop in glass input in the third quarter, except for the "Tablet/Mini-Note" category, which maintained 0.3 million square meters per month. According to DisplaySearch Senior Analyst Shawn Lee utilization rates are projected to be 75%, much lower than the 85-90% recovery planned for the third quarter.</p>
