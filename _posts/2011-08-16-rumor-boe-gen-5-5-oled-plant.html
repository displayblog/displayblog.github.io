<blockquote>
<p>China's First Financial Daily said on August 15 that according to a report it has obtained, BOE is considering constructing a 5.5G AMOLED plant in Ordos, Inner Mongolia. JRJ.com, a financial news website in China, estimated total investment of the project to reach RMB22 billion (US$3.44 billion).</p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>Even if BOE had the financial wherewithal and the government's blessings, it would be extremely difficult to build such a large OLED plant because of the lack of display engineers. The largest OLED fabrication plant right now, a Gen 5.5, has been built by Samsung, one of the largest display manufacturer with legions of engineers with a history of innovation.</p></p>
