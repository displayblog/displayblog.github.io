<blockquote><p>Fantastic hour-long expos&Atilde;&copy; on Nathan Myhrvold&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Intellectual Ventures, which comes out looking like the root of all evil in the U.S. software patent protection racket. Lodsys, of course, is one of their shell company fronts.</blockquote></p>
<p>There about 1300 IV shell companies, companies that don't invent, have no employees, and are all about suing. In a word, patent trolls. Here's how the name came about according to <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/TAL441_transcript.pdf">Peter Detkin</a>, the guy who coined the term:</p>
<blockquote><p>Oh, the story of a troll kind of fits &acirc;&euro;&tilde;cause the whole Billy Goats Gruff thing, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s someone lying under a bridge they didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t build, demanding payment from anyone who passed.</blockquote></p>
<p>Detkin is now a founder and vice chairman of IV in Silicon Valley. How ironic. The expos&Atilde;&copy; is by <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/441/when-patents-attack"><em>This American Life</em></a>.</p>
