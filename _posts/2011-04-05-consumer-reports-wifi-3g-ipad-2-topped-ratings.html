<p><a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/apples-ipad-2-tops-consumer-reports-tablet-ratings-119237109.html">PRNewswire</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Consumer Reports tested tablets from Archos, Dell, Motorola, Samsung, and ViewSonic, as well as several models from Apple. Each tablet was evaluated on 17 criteria, including touch-screen responsiveness, versatility, portability, screen glare, and ease of use, and testers found several models that outperformed the rest. The Apple iPad 2 with Wi-Fi plus 3G (32G), $730, topped the Ratings, scoring Excellent in nearly every category.  The first-generation iPad, $580, also outscored many of the other models tested but tied with the Motorola Xoom, $800.</blockquote></p>
<p>The original iPad is as good as the latest Honeycomb tablet, the Motorola Xoom.</p>
