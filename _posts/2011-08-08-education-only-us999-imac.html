<p>John Brownlee, <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/meet-the-new-999-education-only-imac/108004">Cult of Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Available exclusively to educational customers, the new $999 21-inch iMac includes a 3.1GHz Intel Core i3 dual-core processor, 21.5-inch display, 2GB of DDR3 RAM, 250 GB hard drive, SuperDrive and an AMD Radeon HD 6750 GPU. It ships with Lion, naturally, but educational customers will have to forget about a Thunderbolt port for right now.</blockquote></p>
