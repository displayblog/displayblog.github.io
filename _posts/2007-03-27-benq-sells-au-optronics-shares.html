<p>BenQ Corp (2352.TW) announced that its board of directors (BOD) has decided to sell 100 million shares of AU Optronics Corp (2409.TW) through a block deal. BenQ currently owns 638.03 million shares in AUO       (NYSE:       <a href="http://finapps.forbes.com/finapps/jsp/finance/compinfo/CIAtAGlance.jsp?tkr=AUO" class="maintkrlink">AUO</a><a href="http://www.forbes.com/peopletracker/results.jhtml?startRow=0&amp;name=&amp;ticker=AUO"></a>), representing an 8.42% stake. The 100 million shares represent about 15% of BenQ's AUO shares. Proceeds from the share sale will be used to adjust the company's financial structure. In today's trade, BenQ closed up NT$0.85 at 13.30. AUO fell 0.80 to 47.60 or down US$0.41 to US$14.30, based on US$1 = NT$33.10. AUO's stock seems to be about flat YTD.
