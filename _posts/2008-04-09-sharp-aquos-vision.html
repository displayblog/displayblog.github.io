<p><a href="http://www.aquos-sharp.com/us/main.html?bandwidth=high">Sharp AQUOS Vision</a>: Sharp has a very well-made video about its AQUOS Vision. The latter parts are a bit too zen-like for me. One of the more impressive parts are right in the beginning. Understanding how light is polarized and then "twisted" via the liquid crystals have been hard at best. There have been many drawings and animations to help understand the process. I think I've seen the best video yet of how LCDs work and in particular how light is polarized and twisted.</p>
