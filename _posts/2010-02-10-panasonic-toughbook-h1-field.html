The iPad isn't rugged, at all. At the other end of the spectrum is the IP65 and MIL-STD-810 rated Toughbook H1 Field from Panasonic. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Code">Wikipedia</a>, IP65 means the H1 Field is dust tight (dust can't penetrate) and is protected against water jets. The H1 Field is not water submersible so you'll need to be careful somewhat.</p>
<p>Here are the specs: twin hot-swappable batteries, 1.86GHz Atom Z540 CPU, 2GB RAM, 64GB reinforced SSD, Gobi 2000 (EV-DO/HSPA) WWAN, WiFi ABGN, Bluetooth 2.1+EDR, GPS, 2MP camera, RFID reader.</p>
<p>The Toughbook H1 Field makes use of a 10.4-inch touch-enabled transflective TFT LCD with a 1024x768 pixel format. The transflective LCD can be seen indoors as well as outdoors. Based on the target demographics there is a strong chance the touch technology is resistive, so you can touch the display with gloves on.
