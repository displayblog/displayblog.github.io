<p><a href="http://www.eink.com/display_products_triton.html">E Ink</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In addition to 16 levels of monochrome, Triton is capable of displaying thousands of colors. For image-rich information applications showing charts, graphs, maps, photos, comics and advertising, color displays made with Triton Imaging Film enable ultra low power and high mobility devices with a paper-like experience. And just like E Ink's monochrome ePaper products, Triton's crisp text and detailed color graphics are fully viewable in direct sunlight.</blockquote></p>
<p>E Ink Holdings officially announced its first color electronic paper display called Triton. The color epaper sports a 20% faster response time, is still sunlight readable, and lasts up to a month. Thousands of colors are better than none but will probably be mercilessly compared to the iPad's millions.</p>
