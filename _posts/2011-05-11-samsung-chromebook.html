<p>Anyone with a netbook or notebook gets it to connect to the web. We connect via WiFi or cellular data like 3G. That's why we seek out places with free WiFi like Starbucks and McDonald's. With a built-in 3G connection on some Chromebooks allows the nomadic knowledge worker freedom to work anywhere there's a Verizon signal in the US, and that's almost everywhere. The other cool feature of Google's Chromebook is that there's no hefty, bug-prone, slow operating system between you and getting on the web. Google's Chrome browser is the OS. I like simplicity.</p>
<p>The WiFi-only version will be available for $429 and the version with worldwide 3G for $499. You get 100MB of free 3G data per month from Verizon, but that won't last all that long; you'll most likely need to pay for more. The Samsung Chromebook will be available on June 15 at Best Buy and Amazon.</p>
