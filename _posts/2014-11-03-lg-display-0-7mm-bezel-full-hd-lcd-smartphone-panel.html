<p><a href="http://lgdnewsroom.com/press_releases/4577">LG Display</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>To realize the 0.7mm bezel width on the left and right sides of the panel, which is narrower than the 0.8mm thickness of a credit card, LG Display used its &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Neo Edge&acirc;&euro; module processing technology and the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s first &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Advanced In-Cell Touch (AIT)&acirc;&euro; technology.</p>
<p>LG Display&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Neo Edge technology uses an adhesive instead of double-sided tape to attach and completely seal the total area and edges of the panel&acirc;&euro;&trade;s circuit board and backlight unit. Because there is no plastic guide panel to attach the panel and backlight, the Neo Edge technology helps achieve minimal bezel width, while blocking light leakage and being waterproof and dustproof.</p>
<p>The adhesive seal also prevents corrosion that sometimes occurs along the edge of the glass panel when double-sided tape is used, while dramatically improving the panel&acirc;&euro;&trade;s durability despite the narrow bezel because of increased elasticity as the adhesive hardens.</p>
<p>The company&acirc;&euro;&trade;s AIT technology, exclusively developed by LG Display, reduces the need for bezel space because the touch panel is embedded into the LCD module. The technology offers a slim design and excellent touch, while saving costs since a separate process for touch functions is not required.</blockquote></p>
<p>Narrow left and right bezels, no light leakage, waterproof, dustproof, more durable, and costs less. What&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not to like. </p>
<p>I am assuming this thin bezel 5.3-inch LCD panel is targeting high-end smartphones, so the only thing I would like to see is a bump in pixel format from 1920x1080 to 2560x1440.</p>
