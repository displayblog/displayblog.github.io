<p><a href="http://www.slashgear.com/lenovo-22-inch-widescreen-hd-monitor-an-wuxga-industry-first-177437.php">Slashgear</a>: Typical 22" LCD monitors have a pixel format of 1680x1050. And that seems fine with most of the users that purchase 22" LCD monitors. Why? Well, the price is right. The price is right because the LCD technology used is of the TN variety that makes the cost of manufacturing those panels much cheaper compared to IPS or VA. The second, but a lesser known reason, is that the pixels are much larger than 20" LCD monitors with the same pixel format. Consumers are more comfortable viewing slightly larger fonts. As consumers age in general, they will continue to prefer larger fonts. But isn't it strange that the more pixels you have the fonts have to get smaller? We definitely are living in a high-tech world, and in a Microsoft Windows world. Windows simply does a horrible job of getting more pixels to work in generating a more usable user interface. If you increase the "DPI" setting (who uses "dots per inch" on a LCD anymore?) in Windows, the fonts do get bigger, but the overall "look and feel" becomes a bit less than desirable. Apple seems to do a lot better job in making fonts a bit more readable, but even Apple's fonts used in the UI is less sharp than what I want. Imperfection is what we must live with. And that leads us to Lenovo's ThinkVision L220x.</p>
<p>A 22" LCD monitor with a 1920x1200 pixel format on Windows will have fonts that are terribly small relative to regular 22" monitors. So most consumers won't like it, is my guess. Young consumers, hardcore gamers, niche markets that require more pixels, will definitely welcome this monitor is my first thought. But then, why? There are many 24" LCD monitors with a 1920x1200 pixel format and for not much more money. Also Lenovo is "Made in China". Do you really want to spend that much money on a "Made in China" device? Sure, there are some things made in China that are generally okay to purchase such as Apple's iPhone and... pins? But as far as I know, Apple's engineers swarm around Chinese manufacturers making sure that everything goes well in the beginning of a new project. That's why it's important to get the first generation new stuff from Apple. I think I have gone off tangent too much with this blog post, but this new monitor is not going to do very well is my personal opinion and the bottom line.</p>
<p><em>Update 2008.04.28: </em> I must admit, there must have been external factors contributing to my generally negative impression of products that are made in China. I think I know why. I have three children and two of them love Thomas the Train. When I heard that James (the red one) had lead in its paint, that almost blew my top off! When my first born was younger, there were many times when he had James in his mouth. I had learned that these toys are now manufactured in China. Needless to say, my impression of Chinese made products dropped like a rock. Now I hear contaminated drugs, foods, etc. coming from China. There just does not seem to be an end. But not everything coming out of China is bad. My beloved iPhone is a case in point. The build quality is rock solid and I've had it for about 10 months without any problems.</p>
<p>So, let's get back to the ThinkVision L220x.</p>
<p>The ThinkVision L220x should be a solid product if IBM standards were used to manufacture it. When I think of IBM, I think of ThinkPads. When I think of ThinkPads, I think of rock-solid quality. There are <a href="http://www.notebookreview.com/default.asp?newsID=2440">some reviews</a> that point to a slight decline of quality from the days when IBM was in charge to when Lenovo took over, but overall quality still seems to be an important factor at Lenovo.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://lcdtech.no-ip.info/en/data/lcd.panels.in.monitors.htm">LCD Tech</a>, Lenovo's ThinkVision L220x incorporates Samsung's LTM220CS01 LCD panel. This panel is a S-PVA LCD with a viewing angle of 178/178, a response time of 6ms GTG, a contrast ratio of 1000:1 and a brightness of 300 cd/m2. What this tells me is that the front screen performance of the ThinkVision L220x will be very strong. Although my personal preference is IPS, PVA has come a long way and is very good for general purpose LCD monitors.</p>
<p>It has been difficult tracking down the L220x for sale, but a quick check at PriceGrabber.com brings up the lowest price of <a href="http://computers.pricegrabber.com/flat-panel-lcd-monitors/m/65136643/search=ThinkVision%20L220x/st=sort/sort_type=bottomline">$434.91</a> (plus tax and shipping) from PROVANTAGE, a merchant with 2057 reviews and an average of 5 of 5 stars.</p>
