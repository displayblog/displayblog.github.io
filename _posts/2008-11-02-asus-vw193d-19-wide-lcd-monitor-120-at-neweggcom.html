<p><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824236029&amp;nm_mc=OTC-pr1c3grabb3r&amp;cm_mmc=OTC-pr1c3grabb3r-_-Monitors+-+LCD+Flat+Panel-_-ASUS-_-24236029">Newegg.com</a>: The ASUS VW193D might not be the best 19" wide LCD monitor out there but it should be suitable for a good majority. The brightness at 300 cd/m2 is sufficient as is the contrast ratio of 850:1. Viewing angle is limited to 170/160 but I tend to be right in the middle of the monitor when I work or play so it really isn't much of a problem for most.</p>
<p>The pixel format of 1440x900 is a bit on the low side, but you'll be able to watch 720p HD content without a problem. If you absolutely need to be able to watch 1080p, then you'll need to jump all the way up to a 24" LCD monitor (there are a few 22" LCD monitors that feature a pixel format of 1920x1200). At just US$120 at Newegg.com after a $30 instant discount and a $30 mail-in rebate (expires 2008.11.02 so get it fast) with free shipping, the VW193D is a real bargain!</p>
