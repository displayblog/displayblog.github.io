<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=luminus">Luminus</a> Devices develops and manufactures PhlatLight&Acirc;&reg; (Photonic Lattice) <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led">LED</a> products. At SID 2008, Luminus demonstrated PhlatLight powered products and PhlatLight LED chipsets. I met up with John Langevin, VP, Sales and Marketing and Paul Fredrickson, Director of Marketing at the Sheraton.</p>

<em>The Luminus PhlatLight RGB LEDs were extremely bright!</em></p>
<p>At the suite, Luminus demonstrated its PhlatLight Backlight Unit (BLU) in a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=46"">46&acirc;&euro;¬ù</a> LCD TV. John and Paul informed me that it took just eight light modules to illuminate the 46" <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a>. Each PhlatLight light module comprises of just one LED package containing a single red, green and blue PhlatLight LED. One of the biggest challenges with LED BLUs is light uniformity. The PhlatLight light module takes care of that and also provides a wider color gamut due to the use of red, green and blue LEDs. Another big challenge is complexity. In a 46" LCD TV there are usually hundreds of LEDs and each of them require uniform brightness and color that requires substantial costs in binning. The PhlatLight LED bar is a significant step toward reducing the cost and complexity in implementing LED BLUs for LCD TVs.</p>

<p>By using just 8 light bars, Luminus is able to substantially reduce the complexity of incorporating a LED backlight into LCD TVs. John and Paul noted that PhlatLight-based BLUs has a cost advantage over traditional LED BLUs but will still require time to ramp volume manufacturing to become more competitive with CCFL BLUs. There could also be an opportunity for Luminus to incorporate its PhlatLight LED BLU technology into high-end LCD monitors that require high color gamut capability in addition to being RoHS compliant.</p>

<p>In another room were very small portable projectors: <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lg">LG</a>'s HS102 and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=samsung">Samsung</a>'s SP-P400. Both of these tiny front projectors incorporate the PhlatLight PT54 RGB chipset and generate a brightness of 150 lumens. There were a few screens with the HS102 and SP-P400 generating some fairly bright video. Both units were fairly small and I assume are very light. The overall quality of the images were fairly good and with better screens I am sure the quality could have been even better. The target market seems to be frequent travelers who need to make many presentations and sometimes in close quarters.</p>

<p>There was one more room with a prototype short-throw front projector geared for the home theater market. The prototype was powered by a single PhlatLight PT120 chipset that provides a brightness of 750 ANSI lumens. Successful development of this prototype can lead to home cinema projectors and high end business projectors with LED backlights that feature instant-on operation, high contrast ratios, long lifetimes and wide color gamut.  </p>

<p>Also present at the suit was Samsung&acirc;&euro;&trade;s HL67A750, a 67" <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dlp">DLP</a>-driven rear-projection TV (RPTV) that uses Luminus' PhlatLight LED. According to John and Paul, Samsung's HL67A750 is the largest RPTV using LED as a light source. With a LED light source the color wheel can be eliminated along with the Rainbow Effect that some can detect. With over 100,000 hours to half brightness, Luminus is confident the LED light source will last as long as Samsung's HL67A750. As long as you're not a TV junkie that keeps the TV on 24/7, the LED light source should give you decades of brilliant light to power your 67" HL67A750. John noted that the company's PhlatLight BLU was awarded the 2008 Display Component of the Year Gold Award by SID.</p>
