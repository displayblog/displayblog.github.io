<p>There's a video preview of a LG Optimus 7 prototype, also known as the LG E900. The Optimus 7 runs Windows Phone 7 and sports a 5 megapixel camera and what seem like dual LED flashes.</p>

<p>The overall ID looks nice and simple. The display will most likely be the 3.7-inch 16:9 854x480 TFT LCDs that are used in the Droid and Motoroi smartphones, but that's just a guess.</p>
