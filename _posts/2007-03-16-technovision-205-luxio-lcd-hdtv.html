<p>Technovision, an Italian company in operation since 1987, showcased a mammoth 205" LCD TV! Most likely they have perfected the art of stitching as there are no LCD manufacturing fabs in the world that can produce such a size. Although four 102.5" LCD TV panels could have been stitched together, there is the possibility of nine 68.3" LCD TV panels. I really don't know. The size is impressive and the company seems to be targeting the yacht market according to <a href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/home-entertainment/introducing-the-205+inch-technovision-luxio-lcd-hdtv-big-enough-to-park-two-mini-coopers-on-244877.php">Gizmodo</a>.</p>

<p>With this size, I can now realistically (but not financially) envision an entire wall being a screen. Does it have multi-touch?</p>
