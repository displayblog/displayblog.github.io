<blockquote><p>Sometimes it goes up and down through the course of a month, but it&rsquo;s still a pretty fun milestone that we can now say about one in four websites are now powered by the scrappy open source underdog with its roots stretching all the way back to a single person in Corsica, France. We should be comfortably past 25% by the end of the year.</blockquote><br />
WordPress is darn flexible, and that's why I have&nbsp;stuck with&nbsp;WordPress for over ten years. I guess a lot of others like WordPress, too.</p>
<p>Although I've been happy with WordPress, a couple of weeks ago something went haywire with the MySQL database, which crashed the entire site. I was able to export a sql file, but when I tried to import it into a new locally hosted WordPress instance I ran into some errors. It didn't take many google searches to find solutions, but there were many steps I had to take before WordPress was running with all 7000+ posts.</p>
<p>DISPLAYBLOG is back up again (phew!) and I look forward to another ten years. (I'll be working on customizing the look and feel in the coming weeks.)</p>
