<p style="text-align: left;">The red indicates ships that are out of spot/charter and currently unused. The green indicates an operating ship. As you can see from the snapshot above there are a lot of unused cargo ships coming out of the Nanjing area. There are some operating ships and I hope those carry LCD modules to be integrated into LCD TVs in Mexico. Unfortunately, there is no way for me to know if that is the case from where I am sitting. I am worried that there might not be enough actual demand for LCD goods in the Western Europe and North America regions to warrant recent high expectations in the fourth quarter this year.</p></p>
