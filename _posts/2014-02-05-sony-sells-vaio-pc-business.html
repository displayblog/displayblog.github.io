<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/02/06/sony-sells-vaio/">Mat Smith, Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Amid reforming its TV arm (and splitting it into a stand-alone entity), it's going to sell its PC business and VAIO brand to Japan Industrial Partners (JIP), with the final deal set to be done by the end of March 2014.</blockquote></p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/201402/14-019E/index.html">Sony's press release regarding the sale</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Following a comprehensive analysis of factors, including the drastic changes in the global PC industry, Sony's overall business portfolio and strategy, the need for continued support of Sony's valued VAIO customers, and future employment opportunities for personnel involved in the VAIO business, the Company has determined that concentrating its mobile product lineup on smartphones and tablets and transferring its PC business to a new company established by JIP is the optimal solution.</blockquote></p>
<p>Oh well, there goes the second best PC hardware brand when it comes to design. A design so good <a href="http://nobi.com/en/Steve%20Jobs%20and%20Japan/entry-1212.html">Steve Jobs was willing to put OS X in Sony's VAIOs</a>.</p>
