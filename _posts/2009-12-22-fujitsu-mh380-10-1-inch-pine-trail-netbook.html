<p>Fujitsu's MH380 is a 10.1-inch netbook with Intel's new Pine Rail Atom CPU running at 1.6GHz. The 10.1-inch LCD sports a 1366 x 768 pixel format with an LED backlight. Other specs include: 1.3MP webcam, Fast Ethernet, WiFi BGN, Bluetooth, 250GB 5400RPM SATA HDD, 2GB RAM, 6-cell battery, 1.3kg. The MH380 comes in a variety of colors: Ivory White, Gorgeous Brown (above), Black Diamond. The spherical indentation next to the trackpad is used to scroll by twirling your fingers in a circular pattern. I think that's unnecessarily complex compared to a single multitouch trackpad with dual finger scrolling. The MH380 looks cute, but I'm not so sure about the overly rounded edges.&Acirc;&nbsp;Source: <a href="http://www.akihabaranews.com/en/news_details.php?id=19655&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Akihabaranews_en+%28AKIBA+EN%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">Akihabara News</a>, <a href="http://www.slipperybrick.com/2009/12/fujitsu-unveils-mh380-pinetrail-netbook/">Slippery Brick</a></p>
