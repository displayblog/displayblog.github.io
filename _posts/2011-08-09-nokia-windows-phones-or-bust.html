<p>Nokia president Chris Weber in an interview with <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20110809/exclusive-nokia-to-exit-symbian-low-end-phone-businesses-in-north-america/">Ina Fried</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When we launch Windows Phones we will essentially be out of the Symbian business, the S40 business, etc. It will be Windows Phone and the accessories around that. The reality is if we are not successful with Windows Phone, it doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t matter what we do (elsewhere).</blockquote></p>
<p>Maybe that's why the Meego-based N9 isn't coming to the U.S.</p>
<blockquote><p>We&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll develop for North America and make the phones globally available and applicable. In fact, evidence of that is that the first Windows Phones that will ship are being done by our group in San Diego.</blockquote></p>
<p>Weber means: Nokia will develop <em>Windows Phones</em> for North America and make the phones globally available.</p>
