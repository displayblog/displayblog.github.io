<blockquote><p>The smartphone codenamed Sony Ericsson Xperia Nozomi will come with Android 2.3.5 Gingerbread at launch and will be built around a 4.3" LCD display of HD resolution (1280 x 720 pixels). The 12 megapixel camera with FullHD video recording was also confirmed by our tipster.</blockquote></p>
<p>At first I thought this Sony Ericsson Arc HD codenamed Nozomi was going to be the first smartphone with a <em>matte</em> cover glass, but upon close inspection there seems to be an antiglare film on top of the cover glass. Shucks.</p>
