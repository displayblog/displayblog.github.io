<p><a href="http://blog.sony.com/press/30541/">Sony</a>: Want a thin TV? I mean a <em>really </em>thin one? The X900C is a little less than 0.2 inches. To put that in perspective, the iPhone 6 is 0.27 inch thick. Man. The X900C comes in 55-inch and 65-inch sizes, both are 4K, and sport TRILUMINOS color technology. To not mount one of these would be criminal. Coming this summer.</p>
