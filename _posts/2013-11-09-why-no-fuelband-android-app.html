<p><a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/10/30/nike-fuelband-isnt-android-quality-first-scale-second/">Paul Sawers, The Next Web</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;With the original FuelBand, you <em>still</em> had the challenge of catering for 200 different handsets and however-many versions of the operating system,&acirc;&euro; continues Olander.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;As we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re looking forward, for us it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s really about making sure we have a great experience. We have nothing against Android. Our running app [Nike+ Running] is on both iOS and Android, and we have learned a lot from that &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; at the end of the day, you really do get reach. But for us it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s quality first, scale second. If we can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t guarantee quality to a number of our users, we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll wait until the platform is ready. And right now, we don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t believe the effort is worth the return, for Bluetooth LE. And we want to do it really, really well for iOS.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>Quality first, scale second. I like the way Stefan Olander, VP of Digital Sport at Nike thinks.</p>
