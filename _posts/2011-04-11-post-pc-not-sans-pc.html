<p>Michael Gartenberg at <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/159077/2011/04/gartenberg.html">MacWorld</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The iPad and other devices are not here to displace the PC (by which I mean all personal computers, whether they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re Macs or PCs running Windows). In fact, <em>post PC</em> means <em>after PC</em>, a new generation of products that build on the PC. What it doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t mean is <em>sans PC</em>, that is, <em>without PC</em>. The personal computer will no doubt be with us for a very long time&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; but that doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t mean we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re not in the post-PC world.</blockquote></p>
<p>I think soon enough post-pc will <em>mean</em> sans-pc for a good majority of folks: for many the iPad is their first PC.</p>
