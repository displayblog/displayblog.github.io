<p>[ <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2015/11/04/exclusiveapple-contemplating-huge-campus-of-up-to.html">Silicon Valley Business Journal</a> ] Nathan Donato-Weinstein:</p>
<blockquote><p><a class="saveLink" href="http://www.bizjournals.com/profiles/company/us/ca/cupertino/apple_inc/17304">Apple Inc.</a> and the city of San Jose are working toward a development agreement that would allow the Cupertino-based juggernaut to build a north San Jose campus of up to 4.15 million square feet, according to city records &mdash; an amount larger than Apple&rsquo;s &ldquo;spaceship&rdquo; campus under construction in Cupertino.</blockquote><br />
North of&nbsp;Highway 101 just across from&nbsp;San Jose International Airport. <em>If</em> Apple was planning to manufacture a car it would need a large factory, wouldn't it?</p>
