<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/13/technology/motorola-to-cut-20-of-work-force-part-of-sweeping-change.html?_r=3&pagewanted=all">Claire Cain Miller, The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Woodside also plans to cut the number of devices Motorola makes from the 27 it introduced last year to just a few.</blockquote></p>
<p>Focus resources to make, not a lot of mediocre phones but, a few awesome ones. Sounds like a good plan.</p>
