<p>Taiwan&#39;s Investment Commission announced that it would lift the ban on investments of small-size (4" and smaller) panel cell processes for Taiwan-based display companies. Following that announcement, Toppoly applied to invest in Philips Electronics LCD module plant in China. Most expect Taiwan&#39;s Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) to approve of the application.

<p>Small-medium display R&amp;D is accelerating as display manufacturers scramble to find ways to increase profit margins and lower costs. Because many display companies entered the small-medium display market at around the same time, competition has been intense and prices have tanked. Older fully-depreciated G1-G3 fabs are now being employed to produce millions of mobile phone displays and PMP displays such as Sony PSP&#39;s 4" wide TFT LCD. Most of the R&amp;D is allocated toward OLED development, Active Matrix OLED (AMOLED), Low-Temperature Poly-Silicon (LTPS) and other advanced technologies.</p>
