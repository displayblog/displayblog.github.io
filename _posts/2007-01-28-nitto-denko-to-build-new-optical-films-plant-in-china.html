<p>Nitto Denko will construct a new optical films plant in Guangming Hi-tech Park in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China. Nitto Denko is the market leader for polarizers that are used in the manufacture of LCDs. Currently there are only three LCD manufacturers in China that include Infovision Optronics, SVA-NEC and BOE OT. However, my guess is Nitto's new optical plant would supply LCD manufacturers in Taiwan. Also, the polarizer repair market is strong and would generate revenues for Nitto as well.</p>
