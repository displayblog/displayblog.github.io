<p>Teco is a brand that I&#39;ve never heard of. And that&#39;s how it&#39;s going to be with a lot of brands popping up from Taiwan, China and other Asian countries. The TL3781 has a 37" LCD with 1366*768 pixel format and was introduced in early May. Price? About $1700 and a little expensive considering you have other brands such as Syntax Olevia that have 37" boxes for less than $2000. If I am going to purchase a no-name, I would buy from Syntax because they use LG.Philips LCD panels that have IPS technology, which IMHO is the better LCD technology compared to VA or TN.</p>
