<p>Celoxica's Design Suite of electronic system level design (ESL) solutions, PixelStreams video and imaging IP library and fully integrated RC Series programmable development platforms will be incorporated by CPT to accelerate implementation of pre- and post-image processing of progressive-scanned HDTV standards. Celoxica's tools will enable CPT to improve production times while product complexity and time-to-market pressures grow.</p>
<p>PixelStreams is a library of IP cores for digital image and video processing. With a block-based graphical entry system, the time it takes to develop image processing systems are shortened.</p>
