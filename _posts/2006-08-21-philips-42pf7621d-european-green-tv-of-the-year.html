<p>The European Imaging and Sound Association (EISA) is the largest editorial multimedia organization in Europe with 37 member magazines from 19 European countries. The EISA judges pronounced Philips' 42PF7621D 42" LCD TV "European Green TV of the Year". EISA judges were impressed by the low power consumption, which was 15% less than #2. And at the end of its life, the components that make up the 42PF7621D can be easily separated for recycling or safe disposal. Now, that's really something: this type of design requires deep processing of how a product should be designed based on current production technologies that take into consideration how products are disposed of. Very ingenious.</p>
<p>Philips has a name for such products as the 42PF7621D: "Green Flagship Products". These products perform better than #2 in these areas: energy consumption, weight, hazardous substances, lifetime reliability, recycling and disposal.</p>

<p>Although environmentally, the 42PF7621D is top-notch, when it comes to actual front-screen performance, there are some aspects still requiring improvement. For instance, the resolution is only 1366 x 768. Why not go all the way to 1920 x 1080 and still make it a Green Flagship Product? Brightness is a respectable 550 cd/m2 while contrast ration is 4,000:1. Of course, that spec is based on dynamically manipulating light to improve contrast. Viewing angle is a good 176 degrees. Because the 42PF7621D is a European version, the TV systems that it supports are DVB COFDM, PAL and SECAM but can also playback NTSC video. There are also two HDMI ports.</p>
