<p>SCHOTT, a Germany-based maker of glass used in LCDs and other applications, started the construction of three melting tanks in Valasske Mezirici in the Czech Republic on April 24. The company is enhancing its capacity for the glass tubing used in display backlights. SCHOTT entered this market only three years ago with its UV-blocked glass with major customers in Asia. The first melting tank will start production in August 2006 and the other two will follow in one month.</p>
