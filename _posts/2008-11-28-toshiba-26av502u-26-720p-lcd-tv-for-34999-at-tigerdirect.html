<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=toshiba">Toshiba</a>'s 26AV502U is a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=26"-lcd-tv">26" LCD TV</a>. It sports a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1366-x-768">1366 x 768</a> pixel format so it will handle <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=720p">720p</a> video sources without a hitch. Bear in mind that 720p video content will be scaled a bit to fit the 1366 x 768 screen completely. That will reduce the quality a bit but most people won't be able to notice as long as it is quality 720p content like from a PS3. I've mentioned this in other posts but don't mind that the 26AV502U doesn't have 1080p capability via a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a> pixel format. You will be hard pressed to find quality <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1080p">1080p</a> content. And, most people can't tell the difference between watching 720p and 1080p at suggested viewing distances. So save yourself your hard-earned money. Other specifications are pretty standard such as the 8ms response time (a bit on the slow side so you'll be experiencing some motion blur on fast moving content like football but will be just fine for almost all other content), the 500 cd/m2 of brightness is actually very bright, and the 160/160 viewing angle will force some of your friends to squeeze in toward the middle to get the best view. Like most of the Black Friday deals, the 26AV502U is a great bargain if you live in a smallish flat (or want a second LCD TV for your bedroom) and want to maximize your buck: <a href="http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=4167731&amp;SRCCODE=PRICEGRABBER&amp;cm_mmc_o=2mHCjCVybgwTyz__wyCjCVqHCjCdwwp">$349.99 at TigerDirect</a>!</p>
