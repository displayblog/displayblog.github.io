And the result is: Apple grabbed 17.2% of worldwide mobile PC shipments in Q4'10 making it the top brand, ahead of HP.</p>
<p>Apple shipped 10.2 million notebooks and tablets. HP at #2 shipped 9.3 million units while #3 Acer posted shipments of 8.4 million. Worldwide shipments of mobile PCs (notebooks and tablets) increased 8% Q/Q and 17% Y/Y to 59.6 million units in Q4'10.</p>
<p>Most of that growth was due to strong demand for tablets, particularly the iPad. It <em>is</em> interesting that the iPad was lumped into the mobile PC category; going forward Apple will probably extend its lead. Why?
