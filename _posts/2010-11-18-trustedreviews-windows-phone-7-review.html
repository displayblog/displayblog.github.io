<blockquote><p>However, while generally okay for most uses, we feel Microsoft has swung a little too far towards style and away from substance. Missing essentials like Copy and Paste and multi-tasking, and nice-to-haves like Flash support in the web browser, mean it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a step behind the competition on stats alone. Moreover, much of the interface eschews perfectly sensible design conventions and tries to do something different, seemingly just for the sake of it. This is most acutely felt with the whole single column homepage arrangement.</blockquote></p>
<p>I actually like this new Metro UI design language; it is quite refreshing when all I've known were webOS, iOS, and Android. I don't care much for Flash but copy & paste as well as multitasking are essential for a smartphone OS to compete in 2010.</p>
