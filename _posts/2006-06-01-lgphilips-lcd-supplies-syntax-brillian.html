<p>This is somewhat old news, but the exact sizes of LCD TV TFT LCD panels that LG.Philips LCD will be supplying Syntax-Brillian are: 20", 23", 32", 37", 42", 47". What is missing is the 26", which is about the 3rd most popular size right now after 32" and 20" (4:3). Nikkei believes that the highest demands are for 37" and 42".</p>
