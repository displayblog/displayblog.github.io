<blockquote><p>That brings us to our favorite part of the Envy 17: its edge-to-edge glass, 1920 x 1080-resolution, 17.3-inch BrightView display. Maybe it's that we've gotten so used to 13- and 15-inch laptops, but the extra screen space is much appreciated for keeping multiple windows scattered around while working and then closing them down to watch a movie in true HD on Blu-ray. Speaking of which, that high definition experience on this rig is nothing short of magnificent -- we queued up <em>Sweeny Todd</em> on the big screen and we were immersed in the crisp quality of the Tim Burton's world.</blockquote></p>
<p>1920x1080 combined with Blu-ray is a perfect match for a multimedia notebook. There are smaller units that sport 1920x1080 but because modern operating systems still lack resolution independence you'll be getting <em>tiny</em> fonts and icons. Sure you can change the DPI settings on Windows but then you'll be dealing with fonts and icons that are larger but ugly too. I think a 17-inch display is a very good size for this pixel format. The only real question is: can you deal with the weight?</p>
<p>A notebook PC is more than just the display, but not by much. When I'm in front of my 17-inch MacBook Pro I am interacting with the display 100% of the time. Sure the keyboard, battery life, etc. are all important but the most important is the display. It isn't surprising that a display guy like me would say this but I imagine it is the same with you. I wonder when the MacBook will sport an IPS LCD...</p>
