<blockquote><p>WWith the success of the Amazon Kindle Fire, Apple can no longer sit idly by and watch this part of the market get gobbled up by a competitor. An avalanche must be averted.</blockquote></p>
<p>I don't think there has been one day Apple has been idle since Steve Jobs came back to run the show in 1997. I'd bet for the foreseeable future everyone at Apple will be working as best as they can every single day. Apple will most likely upend markets, piss off incumbents, just to get us some insanely great products and services. But I don't think a 7-inch tablet is one of them.</p>
