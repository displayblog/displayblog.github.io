<blockquote><p>An astute reader reminds us that while LG, Panasonic and Chimei make IPS screens, Samsung traditionally does not.</blockquote></p>
<p>Not astute. LG Display makes the majority of the 9.7-inch IPS LCD that goes into the iPad. As for Panasonic, nope. Chimei? I'm sure the reader meant Chimei Innolux. And CMI as of yet is only rumored to be making the IPS LCD in the hopes of supplying Apple. Surprise surprise: the #2 supplier of the iPad displays is Samsung. Yes, Samsung has licensed IPS knowhow and manufactures IPS LCDs for Apple's iPad.</p>
