<p><a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com/2010/11/04/skyfire-for-iphone-review-flash-video-on-your-iphone/">Download Squad</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a nutshell, if you love watching videos on your iPhone and have ever thought, <em>'damn, I wish I had Flash on my iPhone,'</em> then Skyfire is for you. If, like me, you rarely watch video on your iPhone and when you do, there's normally a HTML5 H.264 stream available for the iPhone, then Skyfire doesn't add enough to the Mobile Safari formula to justify your three bucks. It's a decent browsing experience, and the video is well-integrated, but it's no revolution in iPhone browsing.</blockquote></p>
<p>Demand was so high Skyfire sold out and is no longer available on the App Store. Not until <a href="http://www.skyfire.com/product/iphone">Skyfire Labs</a> adds more capacity.</p>
