<blockquote><p>I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m happy to say that the pen works pretty well, though it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s by no means amazing or different from what&acirc;&euro;&trade;s out there. The pen is a decent size and weight, grips easy, and registers on the screen quickly. Lag is barely noticeable and the resolution of the input is good. You can write small if you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re careful, and dot your &acirc;&euro;&oelig;i&acirc;&euro;s with some precision. There&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a bit of lag when &acirc;&euro;&oelig;touching down&acirc;&euro; for the first time in an app or on the desktop, but generally it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not bad. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m more concerned about the feeling of writing with a plastic tip on a glossy surface. It feels unnatural and the clacky noise it makes when you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re writing isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t heartening.</blockquote></p>
<p>If you like to doodle, the HTC Flyer seems to be the only Android game in town. But to doodle you'll need to pony up US$80 for the stylus. Way too expensive if you ask me.</p>
