<p><a href="http://www.fiftythree.com/pencil">Pencil</a> is a digital stylus by FiftyThree for the company's popular drawing app <a href="http://www.fiftythree.com/paper">Paper</a>. Pencil connects to iPad <em>via</em> Bluetooth Low Energy and features palm rejection, erase, and blend. The first two are common place for Bluetooth LE digital styli, but blend is intriguing: Use pencil to draw and your finger to smooth rough edges and blend colors. This is just the way I'd want to work on a real canvas, drawing tools, and my fingers. The design is simple, to-the-point, and gorgeous.</p>
<p>Pencil is available in walnut (pictured above, US$59.95) and graphite ($49.95). The walnut version has magnets for sticking on your iPad Smart Cover. If you enjoy using Paper, but have not yet found the perfect stylus, Pencil is it.</p>
