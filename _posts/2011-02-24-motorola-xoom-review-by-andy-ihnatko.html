<p><a href="http://www.suntimes.com/technology/ihnatko/3992213-452/hands-on-review-how-does-motorola-xoom-compare-to-ipad.html">Andy Ihnatko</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The big problem with the XOOM&acirc;&euro;&trade;s display is its color. The screen looks fine when using apps and games. But photos and videos are a different story: the colors look a little washed-out and cheap. Rich golds become dingy browns. Blue skies become slightly overcast. While watching Pixar&acirc;&euro;&trade;s &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Up,&acirc;&euro;¬ù scenes that should have looked nearly as rich and crisp and thrilling and vibrant as they do on my TV looked like they would have on the seatback video of a commercial airliner.</p>
<p>The display&acirc;&euro;&trade;s lack of color intensity isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t dealbreakingly noticeable, but when you set the XOOM next to an iPad displaying the same content, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a complete slaughter. That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a real shame on a device that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s genetically predisposed towards being a fantastic media player. I hope this is something that Motorola can fix with an update to the XOOM&acirc;&euro;&trade;s display driver.</blockquote></p>
<p>The 9.7-inch 4:3 IPS LCD on the iPad is top-notch. I would have assumed Motorola would have wanted to at least match the iPad's display in terms of performance. I guess not.</p>
