The Taiwan-based LCD manufacturer will invest NT$1.21 billion (about US$37.5 million) to purchase 60% of the 50 million new shares that Unity Opto will be placing at NT$40.24 per share. Unity Opto is a LED packing company based in Taiwan and will use the funding to expand its LED packaging capacity to meet expected demand in 2010. Unity Opto forecasts both revenues and capacity to increase 60-70% next year.</p>
<p><strong>LED ESSENTIAL</strong> For LCD manufacturers like HannStar Display securing a stable source of LEDs is essential as the shift from CCFL to LED as the lightsource for backlight units in LCDs will accelerate and impact all applications including LCD TVs, LCD monitors and notebook PCs.
