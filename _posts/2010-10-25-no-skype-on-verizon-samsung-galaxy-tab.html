<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/25/verizons-galaxy-tab-wont-have-skype-nfl-mobile-or-v-cast-vid/">Engadget</a>: At launch the Samsung Galaxy Tab will not have Skype. Unfortunate, but we must realize Verizon probably makes the most money selling voice subscriptions. And since the Galaxy Tab is a data-only device Verizon doesn't want to jeopardize its main business. There is hope: Since Android is easy to play with I am sure there will be ways to install Skype and Skype-like VoIP apps on the Tab. In the end Verizon just wasted a bunch of time and resources trying to thwart the tectonic move toward voiceless data-only subscriptions and VoIP communications.</p>
