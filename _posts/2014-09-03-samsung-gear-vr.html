<p>Adi Robertson, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/3/6102547/why-oculus-needs-samsung-gear-vr-headset">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Gear VR is a mobile alternative to the Oculus Rift, which has to be wired into a power source, a computer, and an external camera. The second development kit&acirc;&euro;&trade;s screen was a big improvement over the first &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; it uses the display from Samsung&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Galaxy Note 3, which means that because half the screen is shown to each eye, you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll see a 960x1080 image. But it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s got a lower resolution than the Quad HD Note 4, which will give the Gear VR an effective resolution of 1280x1440. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/3/6101929/john-carmack-goes-into-nerd-overdrive-about-vr-on-the-note-4">John Carmack waxed nerdy</a> about the benefits of Samsung&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Super AMOLED panels, describing his system for drastically cutting latency (the Note 3 is also Super AMOLED.)</blockquote></p>
