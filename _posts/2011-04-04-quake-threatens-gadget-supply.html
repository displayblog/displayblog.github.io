<blockquote><p>The March 11 earthquake and ensuing tsunami, as well as the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear-power complex and radiation leakage, have created problems for many manufacturers&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;from auto-parts makers to suppliers of batteries and other key electronic components, such as memory chips and liquid-crystal displays&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that are far beyond the physical damage to their plants and production lines. Utility companies are carrying out rolling blackouts that have reached the wider Tokyo area, and the nuclear-power crisis is expected to take a toll on already-weak consumer spending.</blockquote></p>
<p>Gadgets are important, but more importantly, maybe we can slow down a bit, buy less stuff, and remember to pray for and help those suffering in Japan. Maybe weak consumer spending can be considered a good thing.</p>
