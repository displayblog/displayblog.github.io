<p><a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2011/12/05/crackdown-coming-internet-rumors-compared-to-drugs/">Loretta Chao and Yoli Zhang, The Wall Street Journal, China</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>People on the Internet can &acirc;&euro;&oelig;irresponsibly and unscrupulously produce and spread rumors,&acirc;&euro; the People&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Daily in a commentary published late last week (in Chinese). &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Such &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Internet psychological drugs&acirc;&euro;&trade; are very easily addictive, and make people want to know more and learn more while reading,&acirc;&euro; it said, adding that it is as harmful as &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Internet pornography, gambling and drugs.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>The article gets better: Internet rumors are compared to malignant tumors, heroin and cocaine, with adverse affects on vision, hearing, and nerve intoxication. Oh boy.</p>
