<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-3751 aligncenter" title="eee_keyboard_complete_home_theater_pc" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/eee_keyboard_complete_home_theater_pc.jpg" alt="eee_keyboard_complete_home_theater_pc" width="500" height="333" /></p></p>
<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=asus">ASUS</a> is on to something. The company's <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=eee">Eee</a> Keyboard is a case in point. Look at the picture and you can see that the keyboard looks pretty familiar. My guess is that ASUS lifted it from <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=apple">Apple</a>'s new <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=macbook">MacBook</a> line. Of course, the Eee Keyboard has a few extra buttons. But that's not what is most interesting. The Eee Keyboard is not really just a keyboard. INSIDE the keyboard is a full-blown PC. On the back are many connections: VGA, FireWire, USB (2), Audio In/Out, ExpressCard slot and an Ethernet jack. Add to that a mini-portrait TFT LCD and you've got an interesting product. I'm not sure what the specifications are for the LCD but it looks to be about a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=3.5"">3.5"</a> LCD with a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=480-x-800">480 x 800</a> pixel format. The calendar app that is showing looks very nice and reminds me of another Apple product. Similarities aside the Eee Keyboard is an interesting idea. I hope the innards are easily upgradeable and I'm sure there is a portable case that is in the works.</p>
