<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/12/07/barnes-and-noble-nook-review/">Joshua Topolsky</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Once you get the hang of the system it starts to make some sense, but it's nothing we'd describe as intuitive, and your rhythm is thrown off by one major factor: the extremely sluggish response of the device.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>Compared to the Kindle the Nook is thicker, heavier and smaller: 7.7 x 4.9 x 0.5-inch at 11.2 ounces. Screens: 6-inch 16-grayscale E Ink display up top, 3.5-inch capacitive touch TFT LCD down below. The 6-inch E Ink display is just like what you see on the Kindle. No surprise since the two are essentially the same except for: the Nook was slightly slower at turning pages compared to the Kindle.</p></p>
<p>The 3.5-inch LCD is unique to the Nook and works as "the primary method of interacting with lists and reading selections" and "your navigator, your search box (with keyboard), music player, and a Cover Flow-style book browser". Because the slower E Ink display is linked to the faster LCD you'll need to get used to pauses here and there. Downward swipes on the capacitive touch screen wasn't recognized at times. Well, that's the summary of the display portion of the review. It looks like the Nook was a solid first attempt by Barnes &amp; Noble but will be let down by how slow it is.</p></p>
