<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/12/06/blackberry-rise-and-fall">John Gruber</a>. Senior business development manager at RIM from 2001 to 2011 Vincent Washington, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-12-05/the-rise-and-fall-of-blackberry-an-oral-history">Bloomberg Businessweek</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>One thing we missed out on was that Justin Bieber wanted to rep BlackBerry. He said, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Give me $200,000 and 20 devices, and I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m your brand ambassador,&acirc;&euro; basically. And we pitched that to marketing: Here&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a Canadian kid, he grew up here, all the teeny-boppers will love that. They basically threw us out of the room. They said, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;This kid is a fad. He&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not going to last.&acirc;&euro; I said at the meeting: &acirc;&euro;&oelig;This kid might outlive RIM.&acirc;&euro; Everyone laughed.</blockquote></p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/justin-bieber/">Forbes</a>, Justin Bieber's earnings is US$58 million as of June 2013. After weeding through all the financial mumbo jumbo it seems Blackberry on the other hand lost almost $1 billion according to <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackberry-earnings-2013-9">Business Insider</a>. Two of the reasons why BlackBerry is doing so poorly are: iPhones and Android smartphones. On a related note, I wonder what would happen if you <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ryan-seacrest-typo-keyboard-2013-12">add a Blackberry-like keyboard to the iPhone</a>?</p>
