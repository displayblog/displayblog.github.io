<blockquote><p>We reported that the handset would nix physical menu keys going forward, and would feature a monster 720p -resolution display, and we have now confirmed with our source that the screen itself is branded as a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Super AMOLED HD&acirc;&euro;¬ù display.</blockquote></p>
