<p>Consumer Reports' annual survey of wireless customer satisfaction tapping into 50,000 readers representing 26 US cities shows <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=verizon&amp;sa=Search#1348">Verizon Wireless</a> at the top, followed by T-Mobile at #2 and Sprint at #3. In last place is <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=at%26t&amp;sa=Search#1348">AT&amp;T</a>. AT&amp;T was last in San Francisco, New York and 17 other cities. Here's the conclusion from Consumer Reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you're readying to buy Apple's phone, prepare for possible disappointment with its service and expect to love the phone anyway.</blockquote><br />
Of course AT&amp;T had a rebuttal and pointed to a low churn of only 1.17%. How stupid of AT&amp;T. The comment (second one down) made by Todd Thomas hits the point:</p>
<blockquote><p>churn is low...mainly because I'm under contract and can't leave and the iphone won't work on verizon, where i want to go. churn is NOT what AT&amp;T should look at to determine client happiness.</blockquote><br />
I believe Todd is absolutely right. Source: <a href="http://digitaldaily.allthingsd.com/20091201/att-ranked-last-in-consumer-reports-best-cell-phone-service-survey/">All Things Digital</a></p>
