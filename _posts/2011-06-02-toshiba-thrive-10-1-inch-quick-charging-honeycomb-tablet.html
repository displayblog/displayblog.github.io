<p><a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2011/06/02/toshiba-thrive-android-3-1-tegra-2-quick-charging-battery-all-for-429/">CrunchGear</a>: The Toshiba Thrive is a 10.1-inch 1280x800 Honeycomb (Android 3.1) tablet priced to sell: the 8GB model is $429 and for $50 more you double the storage to 16GB. Want 32GB? That'll be $579. These prices undercut the iPad by a good margin... is what I originally thought. The iPad starts at 16GB so the Toshiba Thrive is just $21 cheaper at $479. But if you really want the lowest-priced Honeycomb tablet, the Thrive might be a good option.</p>
<p>The Toshiba Thrive has two interesting features: a quick-charging battery that goes to 90% in 1 1/2 hours. The other feature is an abundance of ports: full-sized USB (host), HDMI, and a full-sized SD card slot. I think I can get used to more full-sized USB ports on tablets.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell there is no 3G or 4G options for the Toshiba Thrive. But that also means you're not handcuffed to a two-year agreement.</p>
