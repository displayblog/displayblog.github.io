<p>On October 16, 2008, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=liquavista">Liquavista</a> launched its first display platform using its electrowetting technology: Liquavista ColorBright. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=electrowetting">Electrowetting</a>, according to the company, is "a microfluidic phenomena" and "involves modifying the natural surface tension... intrinsic to an oil and water interface at small length scales." What that means is that the surface tension between oil and water is manipulated by applying voltage to generate an optical switch. ColorBright is targeted at segment-driven display applications such as watches and secondary mobile phone displays. The ColorBright displays can be easily seen in bright ambient environments and allows for some interesting designs. Liquavista recently opened a fabrication plant in Dongguang Fenggang, Southern China that will be volume producing ColorBright displays. R&amp;D is conducted in Eindhoven, The Netherlands.</p>
