<p><a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/walt-mossberg-tells-adobe-ceo-to-his-face-that-flash-sucks-on-android/98231">Walt Mossberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the deal between you and Steve Jobs? He was here last year, and he had a chance to expand on what he had previously written about [Flash], and summarized, he said &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Well, I think our duty is to pick technologies in the ascendancy. We feel like Flash is not on the ascendency, we think HTML 5 is, so that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s who we decided to go with for iOS Devices. What&acirc;&euro;&trade;s your respons eto that?</blockquote></p>
<p>Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are a lot of misperceptions out there. When it first broke, people talked about the fact that they thought it was a technology issue, and I think it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s become fairly clear over the last year that it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not about the technology: it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s about a business model issue. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s about control of a platform. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the control of the app store that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s really at issue here. The value proposition Flash has is that we allow people to author programs once and get them to as many devices as possible. We&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve done that with Android. We will have 130 million phone devices that will have Flash on them by the end of the year&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;</blockquote></p>
<p>Mossberg:</p>
<blockquote><p>And I have yet to test a single one where Flash works really well. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m sorry. They struggle on those Android devices.</blockquote></p>
