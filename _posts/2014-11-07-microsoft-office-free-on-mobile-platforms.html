<p>Microsoft Office is free on iOS and Android. At first I was excited, went to the app store, searched for Microsoft Office, and then almost downloaded the free apps. Almost. I realized I didn't need Microsoft Office. I haven't used Word, PowerPoint, and Excel in years. And I hope I never have to.</p>
