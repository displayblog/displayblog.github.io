<p>According to HD Guru, Sony LCD TV prices are expected to drop considerably in May. The blog post states the following price drops for minimum advertised price (MAP):</p>
<ul>
<li>40" 1080p KDL-40S4100: $1699 --> $1199</li>
<li>46" 1080p KDL-46S4100: $1999 --> $1499</li><br />
</ul><br />
The article mentions a KDL-S4100, but I'm sure it should be KDL-40S4100 instead. Sony's <a href="http://b2b.sony.com/Solutions/product/KDL-40S4100">B2B website has the KDL-40S4100</a> with a list price of just $1299.99. Here are some quick specs:</p>
<p>Size: 40"<br />
Aspect Ratio: 16:9<br />
Pixel Format: 1920 x 1080<br />
Contrast Ratio: 2500:1<br />
Input: HDMI (3), Component (2), VGA (1)</p>

<em>Sony KDL-46S4100</em></p>
<p>And the 46" 1080p KDL-46S4100 can be had for <a href="http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10551&storeId=10151&productId=8198552921665381961&langId=-1">$1599.99 on Sony's website</a>. So if what HD Guru is saying is right, that there will be a price drops, it looks like they are going to be limited to about $100 each.</p>
<p>HD Guru states that this is according to "well-placed industry sources" and that Sony is going after market share wants to be on top. Competitors such as Samsung, Sharp, Toshiba and LG are likely to follow.</p>
<p>Online merchant prices are as follows. Currently (2008.05.01 8:56PM PST) you can get a similarly spec'd 40" 1080p KDL-40V4100 for $1292.99 from Butterfly Photo according to <a href="http://electronics.pricegrabber.com/plasma-lcd-televisions/m/67366238/search=kdl-s4100/st=sort/sort_type=price">PriceGrabber</a> and the 46" 1080p <a href="http://electronics.pricegrabber.com/plasma-lcd-televisions/m/67366238/search=kdl-s4100/st=sort/sort_type=price">KDL-46S4100</a> for $1599.99 (plus tax and shipping) from Amazon.com.</p>
