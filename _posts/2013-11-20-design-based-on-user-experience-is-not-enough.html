<p><a href="https://medium.com/design-ux/c90d595eb237">Gianluca Brugnoli, Medium</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Great designers deliver design solutions to business problems. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not only a matter of understanding the users and the context of the experience, and it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not only about problem solving. Being experts of the design process is a crucial skill for a designer, but it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not enough. The process is only a tool, a means to an end. Design leaders are able to get into the core of the specific business problem and goals of the project, and then combine and coordinate the various design activities and tools structuring the design process consequently.</blockquote></p>
