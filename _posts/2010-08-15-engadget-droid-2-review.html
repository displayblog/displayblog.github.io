<p>There seems to be no changes to the 3.7-inch 16:9 aspect ratio 854x480 TFT LCD that is used in the original Droid. Why mess with a good thing? Engadget's <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/08/13/droid-2-review/">Chris Ziegler reviews the new Motorola Droid 2</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you're just looking for the baddest-ass Android phone on Verizon that money can buy, we'd recommend a Droid X or Droid Incredible any day over this, especially since all three are the same price -- unless you're hell-bent on going with a physical keyboard, of course. Both of those other handsets offer superior cameras, a better UI (in the case of the Incredible), and a better display (in the case of the X).</blockquote></p>
<p>Droid 2 changes and non-changes: The oversized completely unnecessary d-pad has been deleted, leading to a much larger keyboard with larger keys including double-width Alt and Shift keys. According to <a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Motorola-Droid-2-Teardown/3502/">iFixit</a> a TI OMAP 3630 running at 1GHz is onboard, faster than the 600MHz CPU in the original Droid. WiFi is a faster N variety. There is still no 720p video capture: for some this is a major strike against the Droid 2 and will probably knock it off the list of smartphones to get. The max video pixel format is 720x480. Stills are five megapixels. Here's what Ziegler had to say about the photo/video-taking capabilities of the Droid 2:</p>
<blockquote><p>The original Droid has a famously bad shooter, and we regret to say the Droid 2 doesn't seem to be much better -- autofocus is still noisy and slow, macro mode doesn't really work, and images are often hazy and heavily artifacted. Making matters worse, Motorola has started using the same cumbersome camera UI featured on the Droid X, which makes changing modes awkward and a less efficient process than it has to be.</blockquote></p>
<p>I don't think I'm alone on this one: I don't want to carry a compact digital camera if I don't have to. Since losing my Canon S90, the photo/video-capturing feature of smartphones has been gaining importance to me.</p>
