<p>Mark, a <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5573680/steve-jobs-on-iphone-4-there-is-no-reception-issue--stay-tuned">Gizmodo</a> reader, sent Steve Jobs and email:</p>
<blockquote><p>Just wanted to drop you a line and let you know that this is the most amazing phone I've ever owned. FaceTime is incredible! Everything is fantastic except the reception issues I've been having.</p>
<p>My buddy has the same issue and he called AppleCare and was shipped a free bumper case. I called too, 2 hours and 3 dropped calls later, I was told that nobody is getting free bumpers. Which is strange because I saw my friends email confirmation showing he was getting a free one. I tried to get one on launch day but the store was sold out. Is there anything you or one of your executive escalations people can do? I love everything about the phone except my signal issues. I hope to hear back with good news.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time,<br />

And here's Steve Job's reply:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is no reception issue. Stay tuned.</blockquote><br />
If this correspondence is legit and if there is no reception issue why should we stay tuned. Stay tuned for what? For a fix maybe? I'm guessing Steve Jobs is asking us stay tuned so the actually-existing reception issue is dealt with and hopefully fixed. And why would Apple give free Bumpers to iPhone 4 users who call and complain about reception problems?</p>
