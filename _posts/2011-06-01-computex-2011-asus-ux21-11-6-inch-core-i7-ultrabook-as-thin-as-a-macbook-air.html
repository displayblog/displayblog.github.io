<p>The Asus UX21 looks very much like a MacBook Air. The Asus UX21 is 17 mm at its thickest point, which just happens to be how thin the MacBook Air is. The difference is in power: the Asus UX21 packs a second generation Core i7 CPU while the MacBook Air is limited to just a Core 2 Duo. Even with an i7 the UX21 is claimed to last up to 7 hours. The trackpad is glass and buttonless, just like the MacBook Air.</p>

<p>It looks like the display is around 11.6 inches since the dimension and shape look almost identical to the 11.6-inch MacBook Air. Well, I think I'll be eating my words when I wrote about this new Intel classification of notebooks called ultrabook: I dismissed it assuming it was just a more expensive netbook. The fact that ASUS was able to pack an i7 into a chassis the size of a MacBook Air is quite impressive.</p>
