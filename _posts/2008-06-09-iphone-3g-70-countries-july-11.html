<p>The iPhone 3G is 36% faster than the Nokia N95 and Treo 750. It took just 21 seconds to load a full page on the iPhone 3G. WiFi took 17 seconds while EDGE took 59 seconds. 3G is looking pretty good. The design is all black (plastic) on the back. The prices! They are even <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/06/07/iphone-20-prices-250-350-450-with-subsidies/">cheaper than what I expected</a>!!! $199 for the 8GB? That's great! And just $299 for the 16GB! </p>
<p>Steve mentioned that "the price is a maximum of $199 all around the world..." Subsidized prices at $199 for the iPhone 3G 8GB. What does this mean for the 16GB model? The iPhone 3G 16GB only available at Apple stores? Some very cool features include geotagged photos, batch deletes, flush headphone jack (3.5mm) that will work with regular 3.5mm earphones. The iPhone 3G has ten radios that include:</p>
<p>3x GSM bands<br />
4x 3G bands<br />
Bluetooth<br />
WiFi (802.11b/g no 'n')<br />
and one more of something</p>

<p>Here's a detailed schematic of the iPhone 3G, courtesy of the FCC:</p>

<p>And with that you get the obligatory size comparison. The iPhone 3G weighs 2g less than the iPhone but is slightly taller, wider and thicker. The smallest of the bunch? <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/05/06/htc-touch-diamond/">HTC's Touch Diamond</a>. Endaget has a nice table for you to see <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/06/09/sizing-it-up-3g-iphone-vs-the-rest/">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2008.06.09 4:50PM PST</strong><br />
Gizmodo has an update that shares some unfortunate news. The iPhone 3G is exceptionally unique, but when it comes to activation and monthly service fees, it's just the same as any other smartphone out there. Let me elaborate.</p>
<p>$30 for unlimited 3G data for consumers<br />
$45 for unlimited 3G data for business users<br />
No in-home activation, you'll need to go to a store: pick either AT&T or the Apple Store</p>
