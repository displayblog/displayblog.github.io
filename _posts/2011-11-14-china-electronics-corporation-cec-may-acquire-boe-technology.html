<blockquote><p>China Electronics Corporation (CEC) is mulling the possibility to acquiring debt-laden LCD panel maker BOE Technology, according to media reports in China. BOE has incurred debts of over CNY8 billion (US$1.26 billion) over the past six years, with losses expected to continue widening due to the inauguration of its new 8G production line.</blockquote></p>
