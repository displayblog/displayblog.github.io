<li>Look up, not down.</li>
<li>Light in front, not in back.</li>
<li>Go external, not internal.</li><br />
</ol></p>
<p>Good tips, but: Don't look up <em>or</em> down; be even with the cam. Light in front is better than back, but front, back, and sides are much better. And don't go searching for a new external webcam to buy, the internal one built into the notebook/monitor/all-in-one is good enough. Just make sure there's enough lighting.</p>
