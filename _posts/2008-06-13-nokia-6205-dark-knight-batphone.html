<p>Verizon Wireless announced the Nokia 6205 Dark Knight edition to celebrate the release of The Dark Knight movie. The movie will be released on July 18, the Batphone will be released about a month earlier on June 15. The Dark Knight emblem is on the back and film-inspired wallpapers, voice tones, and animated screensavers will come with the Batphone. A full movie trailer is also included. Yahoo. Most likely Batman himself wouldn't be caught dead sporting around one of these.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas for a real Batphone: Carbon fiber casing, persistent connection with Batmobile (so you can voice command the Batmobile to come to you), much bigger solar-enabled LCD with multitouch and haptic capability, 5MP+ camera (and second camera for video conferencing) with face detection, LED flash, optical stabilization, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/06/10/hp-elitebook-6930p-141-wide-notebook-pc/">MIL-STD 810F</a> spec'ed, 32GB SSD, and a few other things...</p>
