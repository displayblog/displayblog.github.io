<blockquote><p>Well, that's where the HD7S comes into play: the "S" in the name presumably stands for Super LCD, the newer type of display that HTC's been using on recent 4.3-inch models like the Thunderbolt. It's quite pretty, but otherwise, it's the same HD7 as usual -- and really, considering how nice this hardware is, that's just alright by us.</blockquote></p>
<p>Vlad Savov reviewed the non-Super HD7 back in October and noted narrow viewing angles and poor color reproduction. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/10/20/engadget-htc-hd7-review/">My response back then</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Big display and you&acirc;&euro;&trade;d think HTC would have focused on that display a bit.</blockquote></p>
<p>I guess HTC has with the new HD7S.</p>
