<blockquote><p>The 4-inch WVGA (800 x 480) IPS panel looks good on paper but misses the mark when compared to the competition. Sure, the colors are rich and the viewing angles are wide, but the LCD washes out more than expected in direct sunlight and suffers from a significant amount of backlight leaking out from the edges of the screen, resulting in visible "stains" on solid, dark-colored content.</blockquote></p>
<p>Brightness levels are usually not reported for smartphone displays but my guess is that the T-Mobile G2x also known as the LG Optimus 2X isn't as bright as the competition. Possibly because light is leaking out?</p>
<blockquote><p>Another item that requires improvement is the screen's capacitive touch layer, which is slightly less sensitive than on most other phones. Light touches don't always register, and while this is easily remedied by applying more pressure, it's rather disconcerting -- especially for a handset that's otherwise well designed.</blockquote></p>
<p>All of us smartphone users have at one time or another been spoiled by the near-instant response of the touch system used on the iPhones. Once that expectation has been set it is very difficult to forgive a system that isn't as good. Here's hoping LG will tweak the firmware settings to make it better.</p>
