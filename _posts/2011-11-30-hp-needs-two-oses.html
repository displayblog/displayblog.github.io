<blockquote><p>Interestingly enough, during the same interview, Whitman talked a bit about the future of webOS. She stated that a decision would be made in the next two weeks as there are currently 600 employees in "limbo." The only hint about its future is that Whitman stated that HP needs two OSes (could Android be the other option?).</blockquote></p>
