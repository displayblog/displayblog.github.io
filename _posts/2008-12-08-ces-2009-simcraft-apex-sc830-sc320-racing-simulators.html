<p><a href="http://www.simcraft.com/">SimCraft Corporation</a> announced on December 8, 2008 that it will be unveiling its racing simulators at the 2009 CES show in Las Vegas. The booth will be located at the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC), Booth #25311. The APEX racing simulators come in two packages. The APEX SC830 is developed to train real professional racers and offers three degrees of freedom: roll 40&Acirc;&deg;, pitch 25&Acirc;&deg;, yaw 40&Acirc;&deg;. The APEX SC320 is for the hardcore gamer with two degrees of freedom: roll 20&Acirc;&deg;, pitch 20&Acirc;&deg;. Of course if you're a REAL hardcore gamer the APEX SC830 is for you. Christopher Ciesielka says this about the APEX racing simulators: "APEX offers as close to a real racing experience as possible without actually strapping yourself into a racecar."</p>
<p>The APEX racing simulator looks to sport three <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dell">Dell</a> LCD monitors. These do not look like they are wide aspect ratio but rather 4:3. Of course putting three of those together will make it very wide. If I'm guessing right, we're looking at 4800 x 1200 pixels simulating racing reality so you can burn rubber without having to spend a dime on actual rubber. </p>
<p><em>Update:</em> SimCraft is currently building and planning to bring to CES 2009 the APEX SC830 with a Dell <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/04/13/dell-3008wfp-30-lcd-monitor/">3008WFP</a>! That's a 30" LCD monster! The three-monitor setup is powered by Matrox's Triple Head 2 Go system. Not the fastest GPU on the market but for a tri-monitor setup, I guess that would be a simple way to go. SimCraft should get talking with DisplayLink to get even more monitors hooked up!</p>
<p>And if you're a fan of Sarah Fisher, who is the first woman in North American motorsports history to win the pole position for a major-league, open-wheel race, head on over to SimCraft's booth on January 8, 2009 from 2-4pm because she is scheduled to make an appearance. She'll also be there to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">race humiliate you in the simulators.</p>
<p><em>Update 2009.02.26 4:16PM PST:</em> Just got finished playing around with Premiere and finished the SimCraft video. My friend James is at the wheel of a 6-axis APEX SC830 racing simulator from SimCraft worth $44,000!</p>
