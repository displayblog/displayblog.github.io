<p><a href="http://www.osram.com/appscom/cgi-bin/press/archiv.pl?id=584">OSRAM</a>: Opel's GTC Concept Car uses <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led">LED</a>s from OSRAM Opto Semiconductors for external lighting, namely parking lights, daylight running lights, and fog lights. OSRAM used thin-film technology that substantially increases brightness that allow the reduction of the number LEDs needed for external lighting on automobiles to just a few.</p>
<p>OSRAM's Golden Dragon LEDs illuminate the GTC's parking lights and daytime running lights while just two OSTAR LEDs are used for the headlight's dipped beam. Four OSTAR LEDs are used for the GTC's high beam while just one is used for each fog light.</p>

<p>LEDs have a stated lifetime (rated as time to half-brightness) of 50,000 hours. If you drove 5 hours a day for 365 days a year for 10 years, it would amount to just 18,250 hours. Of course turning the LEDs on and off in addition to vibration and shock will reduce the lifetime but even if lifetimes are reduced by half to just 25,000 hours, we can assume the LEDs will outlast the majority of cars or more accurately the patience of the car owners. Red TOPLEDs are also used to inside the GTC to generate a reddish glow on the four classic instruments on the dashboard.</p>
