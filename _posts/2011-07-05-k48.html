<p>Walter Shimoon <em>via</em> <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/07/05/executive-pleads-guilty-to-leaking-apple-secrets/">New York Times DealB%k</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>So, you can get, at Apple you can get fired for saying K48...outside of a, you know, outside of a meeting that doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have K48 people in it. That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s how crazy they are about it.</blockquote></p>
<p>Not crazy enough, obviously. Shimoon is a Flextronics ex-employee who leaked iPhone and iPod sales figures, plans for a new iPhone, and K48, code for iPad. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and security fraud.</p>
