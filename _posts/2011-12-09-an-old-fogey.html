<p><a href="http://technologizer.com/2011/12/05/how-the-ipad-2-became-my-favorite-computer/">Harry McCracken, Technologizer</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>With the iPad, all that goes away. You can devote nearly every second of your time to the task at hand, rather than babysitting a balky computer. I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t feel like I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m &acirc;&euro;&oelig;using an iPad to write.&acirc;&euro; I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m just writing. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a far more tranquil, focused experience than using a PC or Mac. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s also easier to dive in, do a bit of work as time allows, then dive out&acirc;&euro;&ldquo;especially since the iPad&acirc;&euro;&trade;s instant-on feature is more reliably instant than the alleged instant-on capabilities of traditional computers.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/mobile-news/ipad-2-as-a-serious-writing-machine-how-to/5964">James Kendrick, ZDNet</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What makes the iPad 2 and keyboard combo so effective for my writing is the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;one app at a time&acirc;&euro; nature of the tablet. The running app takes up the entire screen, and thus my focus. There are no distractions presented while writing, just inputting words on the screen.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote><p>I feel like an old fogey, using a Mac for all my writing.</blockquote></p>
<p>Ain't nothing old or fogey about using a Mac for writing. For me, for the way I write, my 17-inch 1920x1200 MacBook Pro is <em>perfect</em>.</p>
<p>PS: Gruber made a small revision. Now it reads: "I'm starting to feel like an old fogey, using a Mac for all my writing."</p>
