<p>Vlad Savov at <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/02/07/lg-optimus-2x-review/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A 4-inch WVGA (800 x 480) LCD might sound like standard fare for modern Android phones, but LG's panel is a notch above the average. It's bright and well saturated, retaining its color fidelity even at oblique viewing angles. We wouldn't say it's any competition to the IPS displays available on Apple's iPhone 4 or Sharp's IS03, but then again, not many are. In the absence of such advanced display tech or Samsung's snazzy Super AMOLED, we reckon LG has given us the next best thing with the 2X's screen.</blockquote></p>
<p>Not IPS? I wouldn't completely rule it out. Remember, LG Display is the company that makes the Retina Display for the iPhone 4. And LG Electronics, the company that makes the Optimus 2X, owns a big chunk of LG Display.</p>
