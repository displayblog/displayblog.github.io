<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/12/20/4s-flop">John Gruber</a>. <a href="http://www.tecca.com/columns/worst-technology-of-2011/">Taylor Hatmaker</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>While it's no flop when it comes to sales figures, the iPhone 4S remains one of 2011's biggest consumer letdowns.</blockquote></p>
<p>I had to look up the word 'letdown' just to make sure I understood this correctly. Letdown is defined in the built-in <em>New Oxford American Dictionary</em> as: "a disappointment or a feeling of disappointment". So Hatmaker thinks the iPhone 4S is one of the biggest consumer disappointments of 2011. Hmm...</p>
<p>Maybe this disappointment is of the type when Apple falls short of analyst expectations, "<a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/10/18/aapl-q4-2011">the pulled-out-of-thin-air consensus</a>" expectations. It must be; Hatmaker all but confirms it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple's newest iteration of the iPhone is certainly nothing to sneeze at &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; it's still one of the fastest, best-looking smartphones on the block &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; but it's no iPhone 5.</blockquote></p>
<p>The iPhone 5 that does not exist except in the excessively imaginative minds of Apple <em>experts</em>.</p>
