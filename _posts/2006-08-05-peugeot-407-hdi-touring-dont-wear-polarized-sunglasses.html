<p>The folks at autospeed has written up an <a href="http://autospeed.drive.com.au/cms/A_2964/article.html">article</a> that shows some peculiar design decisions that Peugoot made on the 407 HDi Touring, some of which are downright stupid, careless and dangerous.</p>
<p>One of the things that Julian Edgar mentions in the article is the LCD screen that shows a range of data: trip computer. climate control, sound system, system warnings, etc. The operation of the car at times depend on using this LCD display, according to Edgar. Well, there's a problem. It seems Peugeot didn't check the polarization of the LCD. What Edgar found out was that the LCD display disappears when using polarized sunglasses.</p>

<p>The top picture of the LCD is what you see without polarized sunglasses. The bottom picture&Acirc;&nbsp; of the LCD is what you see with polarized sunglasses. This is one of the most stupid design errors I've seen in cars. If the top polarizer is polarizes light horizontally, then the vertically polarized sunglesses; and they are 100% polarized vertically to minimize glare from light bouncing off flat surfaces. Light bouncing off flat surfaces are usually horizontal waves of light, much like the light coming out of the LCD in the Peugeot 407 HDi Touring. If you're driving the Peugeot 407 HDi Touring during a sunny day, make sure not to use polarized sunglasses.
