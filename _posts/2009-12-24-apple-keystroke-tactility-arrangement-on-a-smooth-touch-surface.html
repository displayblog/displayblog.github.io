<p>Apple's tablet could possibly integrate a dynamic surface making use of the technology described in its patent application "Keystroke Tactility Arrangement on a Smooth Touch Surface". An "articulating frame" is used to create physical bumps on the surface of a display when in keyboard mode. When not in keyboard mode those bumps disappear. If this technology is employed in the upcoming tablet from Apple, I am very much looking forward to experiencing it. And maybe it'll come to the iPhone / iPod touch as well.
