<p>One more from <a href="http://www.displaymate.com/Tablet_ShootOut_4.htm">Raymond Soneira</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The new Google Nexus 7 has a very impressive display that uses the highest performance LCDs with Low Temperature Poly Silicon LTPS. The very high efficiency LTPS technology allows the new Nexus 7 display to provide a full 100 percent Color Gamut and at the same time produce the brightest Tablet display that we have measured so far in this Shoot-Out series.</blockquote></p>
<p>LTPS isn't cheap, so it's quite remarkable Google hit such a low price for the Nexus 7.</p>
