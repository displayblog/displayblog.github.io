<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/26/nook-color-first-hands-on/">Engadget</a>'s Ross Miller on the B&N Nook Color:</p>
<blockquote><p>While we're still of the mind that this device should have had a PixelQi or Mirasol display, we can report that the LCD is responsive to finger swipes and the viewing angles are quite good...</blockquote></p>
<p>The viewing angles better be good; it is an IPS LCD. The Nook Color is running some version of Android so it'll be hit (2.2) or miss (<2.2) depending on the version.</p>
