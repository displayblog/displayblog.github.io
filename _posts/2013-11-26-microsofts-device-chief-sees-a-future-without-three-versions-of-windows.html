<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/25/5142850/julie-larson-green-future-windows-versions">Tom Warren, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Speaking at the UBS Global Technology Conference last week, Microsoft&acirc;&euro;&trade;s head of devices, Julie Larson-Green, hinted strongly that the software giant is finally working to merge its core operating systems. "We have the Windows Phone OS. We have Windows RT and we have full Windows. We're not going to have three," says Larson-Green.</blockquote></p>
<p>In the near future Microsoft will probably narrow the three to just two: Windows Phone and "full Windows". But does a single Windows operating system for mobile phone, tablet, notebook and desktop computers make sense?</p>
<p>Sure, in the future. A single Windows operating system for every device is possible in the future if you assume technology in the future will solve all the technology limitations we have today. Sure.</p>
