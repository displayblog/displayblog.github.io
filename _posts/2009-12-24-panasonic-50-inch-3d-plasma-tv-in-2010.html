<p>Panasonic will begin manufacturing 120,000 plasma display panels (PDPs) per month at its new Amagasaki plant next month. With an additional US$2.3 billion investment the company plans to increase capacity to 1 million PDPs per month. Panasonic plans to be the very first Japanese consumer electronics company to have a 3D TV commercially available in 2010 and will use the Amagasaki to manufacture 50-inch 3D PDPs. Panasonic believes 3D plasma TVs will be superior to 3D LCD TVs.
