<p>On March 17, 2009 Samsung Electronics announced the mass production of its economical line of digital information displays (DIDs) called Basic Digital Information Displays (B-DID). B-DIDs are geared for indoor applications where round-the-clock use isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t needed such as retail, food outlets, schools, museums, etc. According to Scott Birnbaum, VP of the LCD Group at Samsung's Digital Solutions business division, "More and more companies are realizing that digital information displays are not simply TVs in a commercialized venue, but rather advanced electronic signage needed by smaller businesses and chain stores where limited usage is required.&acirc;&euro;¬ù</p>
<p>How economical are the B-DIDs? They are cost-competitive with consumer television sets. So what's the difference? The B-DIDs are tailored for commercial applications and can be mounded in either landscape or portrait configurations. These have heat management systems built-in since they will be on for quite a long time, just not 24 hours. The B-DIDs come in four sizes: 32", 40", 46" and 52". They will most likely be using S-PVA technology since pivoting a landscape-oriented TN display will result in some terrible viewing angles (my HP w2408h being a good example). Contrast ratio is rated between 3000:1 and 4000:1, which is pretty good.</p>
<p>The B-DIDs from Samsung should lower the cost of entry for digital signage solutions that do not require 24-hour usage.</p>
