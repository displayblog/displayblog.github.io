<p>Nokia is taking a jab at the iPhone 4's reception issue, something Steve Jobs is denying (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/27/steve-jobs-on-iphone-4-there-is-no-reception-issue-stay-tuned/">Steve Jobs On iPhone 4: "There Is No Reception Issue. Stay Tuned."</a></em>). Nokia postulates in <em><a href="http://conversations.nokia.com/2010/06/28/how-do-you-hold-your-nokia/">How do you hold your Nokia?</a></em> four ways you can hold your Nokia phone:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thumb and finger</li>
<li>The cup</li>
<li>The balance</li>
<li>The four edge grip</li><br />
</ul><br />
And here's what Nokia states:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve found any of the four grips mentioned above to be both comfortable and as you can see, offer no signal degradation whatsoever. This isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t a feature you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll only find on high-end Nokia devices either. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s something that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s been a part of pretty much every Nokia device ever made (perhaps with the exception of that teardrop 3G one, which was a bit ridiculous).</p>
<p>The key function on any Nokia device is its ability to make phone calls. After all, that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s why we know them universally as mobile phones (or smart phones, feature phones or mobile computers &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; though the same grip styles work for those, too). One of the main things we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve found about the 1 billion plus Nokia devices that are in use today is that when making a phone call, people generally tend to hold their phone like a&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;. well, like a phone. Providing a wide range of methods and grips for people to hold their phones, without interfering with the antennae, has been an essential feature of every device Nokia has built.</p>
<p>Of course, feel free to ignore all of the above because realistically, you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re free to hold your Nokia device any way you like. And you won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t suffer any signal loss. Cool, huh?</blockquote><br />
Well, no. User SmackMule has some reception problems with his Nokia E71, recorded and posted up on YouTube for everyone to see: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amPG52DVQuk"><em>Nokia E71 Reception Problems</em></a>. He even has an AT&amp;T Femtocell installation at home that brings the connection up to five bars from a maximum of three bars before. When he holds the E71 the five bars drop down to... zero. When he puts it back down on the table the five bars reappear. In the comments he mentions that he is cupping the E71. I guess "the cup" is not a viable method on the E71. There is the off chance that his E71 could be a lemon, but this might be a more industry-wide problem. Are you a Nokia user? Have you had any reception problems like this?</p>
