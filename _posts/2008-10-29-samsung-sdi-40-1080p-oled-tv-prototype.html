<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=samsung-sdi">Samsung SDI</a> showcased a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=40"-oled-tv">40" OLED TV</a> with a pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a> at the FPD International 2008 show. According to <a href="http://www.oled-info.com/samsungs-new-40-oled-tv-high-def-1920-x-1080">OLED-Info</a>, Samsung had already showed a 40" <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=oled-tv">OLED TV</a> prototype back in 2005 however that unit didn't have Full HD capability and having limited to just <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1280-x-800">1280 x 800</a>. The new <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=40"">40"</a> OLED TV prototype has a contrast ratio of 1,000,000:1, the previous prototype was limited to 5000:1. The company claims that it is the world's first and world's largest.</p>
<p>The benefits of OLED technology applied to the TV application are many: because the organic light emitting diodes are themselves a light source, an additional light source is unnecessary. LCDs require a backlight and the backlight consumes a considerable amount of energy. The backlight not only consumes the most amount of energy as a LCD component it also requires a lot of space, although there has been much advances in making it thin. OLED technology because it does not require a backlight can be made extremely thin. The contrast ratio of 1,000,000:1 is already competing against the best that PDP technology has to offer, which by the way is <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=pioneer">Pioneer</a>'s <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=kuro">KURO</a> PDPs. LCD technology can attain such high contrast ratio when incorporating a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led-backlight">LED backlight</a> with <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=local-dimming">local dimming</a> technology such as <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sony">Sony</a>'s <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=xbr8">XBR8</a> series of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a>s.</p>
