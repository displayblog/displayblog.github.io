<p>On November 15, 2007, <a href="http://www.lgphilips-lcd.com">LG.Philips LCD (LPL)</a> announced a LCD panel that is resistant to virtually any kind of dirtying by incorporating a similar principle that is used on non-stick frying pans. The prototype is a 15.4" LCD geared for notebook PC applications and is resistant to dirt, fingerprints and even permanent ink can be easily wiped off.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2008/2046417445_d3cc228bf6.jpg?v=0" height="362" width="400" /></p></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">LPL stated that standard panels have anti-glare films that tend to hold onto oil and other substances. An additional layer on top of the anti-glare film can eliminate the problem, but requires an extra manufacturing step in addition to incurring more cost. LPL is hush-hush about more details of its non-stick 15.4" LCD but volume production is slated for 1H'08. I am sure LPL will apply its non-stick magic on other LCD sizes very soon. Although pen marks are generally not a problem for notebook PCs, I can see that semi-ruggedized notebook PCs for outdoor use can benefit from this development. Oh, and notebook PCs for kids would definitely last longer with a non-stick LCD solution.</p><br />
