<p><a href="http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/201108/11-086E/index.html">Sony</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"WhiteMagic" incorporates a 3-inch VGA low-temperature [polysilicon] TFT LCD module that adds a white (&acirc;&euro;&tilde;W&acirc;&euro;&trade;) pixel to the Red-Green-Blue (&acirc;&euro;&tilde;RGB&acirc;&euro;&trade;) pixels. By improving the brightness of the entire screen, Sony has been able to develop a module that offers one mode to reduce the power consumption of backlight by around 50%, as well as another mode that approximately doubles the brightness to improve outdoor visibility.</blockquote></p>
<p>This sounds like Samsung's Nouvoyance RGBW PenTile Matrix technology. Other specs include: 60% NTSC color gamut, 1000:1 CR, 160/160 viewing angles, 470-nit low power mode, and 1000-nit outdoors mode. Expected to ship early October, 2011 for &yen;5000.</p>
