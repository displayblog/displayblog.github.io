<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/02/17/perspective">John Gruber</a>. <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2012/02/16/ios-devices-in-2011-vs-macs-sold-it-in-28-years/">Horace Dediu</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The iOS platform as a whole reached 316 million cumulative units at the end of last year. The iOS platform overtook the OS X platform in under four years and more iOS devices were sold in 2011 (156 million) than all the Macs ever sold (122 million).</blockquote></p>
<p>The iPhone itself has cumulative sales way more than the Mac, but I wonder how long it will take for the iPad, a more expensive device and a device poised to cannibalize notebooks, to overtake cumulative sales of Macs. It actually might take longer than I think it will because if you look closely at the chart the slope for Mac sales is getting steep toward the end.</p>
