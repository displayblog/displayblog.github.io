<p>EVA's InterView is a dual LCD display you can flip. It sports two 17-inch LCDs with a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=1440+x+900&amp;sa=Search#1348">1440 x 900</a> resolution, each. The unique feature of the InterView is that you can flip the LCD over. Want in on the flip action? It'll cost you US$640. Of course you can use the dual 17-inch as a single display with a 2880 x 900 resolution. But you shouldn't. If you're expecting a seamless experience you're not going to get it. Look closely at the big fat bezel in the middle. You should only use the InterView in dual window mode. So forget about using this has your ultra-wide gaming monitor.</p>
