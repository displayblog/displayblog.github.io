<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/24/6839235/apple-ios-8-0-1-released">The Verge</a>: Apple released iOS 8.0.1 today for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Do not update. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>No cellular connection.</li>
<li>TouchID does not work.</li><br />
</ul><br />
If you already updated, <a href="http://www.imore.com/ios-801-kill-touch-id-and-cell-service-your-iphone-6-or-iphone-6-plus-heres-how-to-fix">iMore has a fix</a>.</p>
<p>A few cracks I have noticed recently: iPhone 6 Plus supply far short of demand (supply chain management fail, forecasting fail, or marketing ramming its schedule down the throats of SCM folks at Apple), <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/09/23/iphone-6-plus-bent-out-of-shape/">iPhone 6 Plus getting bent out of shape</a> (external design folks flexing its muscle over structural integrity engineers), and a botched patch (iOS software folks simply failing to test thoroughly).</p>
