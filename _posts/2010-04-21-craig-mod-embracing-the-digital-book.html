<blockquote><p>... iBooks and Kindle.app are incompetent e-readers. They get in the way of the reading experience and teach digital books like poorly typeset PDFs.</blockquote><br />
iBooks' specific distraction:</p>
<blockquote><p>Instead of allowing the text to breathe, iBooks jams the readers' field of view with the detritus of a 3D 'book.'</blockquote><br />
Oliver Reichenstein at iA Inc. regarding iBooks' general metaphor in <a href="http://informationarchitects.jp/designing-for-ipad-reality-check/"><em>Designing for iPad: Reality Check</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Having the same static thick paper stacks left and right in your e-reader application, on the first as well as on the last page is not just visually wrong, is also confusing; it feels wrong and it is wrong. It's kitsch.</blockquote><br />
I did seem weird that there were 'pages' behind the very last or before the very first page. If the 'thickness' of these pages changed based on where I was in the iBook then it would make sense. A full screen mode would be appreciated where the 'iPad' text, the time and battery level indicator, 'pages' and animations all disappear.</p>
<p>I find the ability to change fonts and sizes in iBooks to be a strange idea. This option takes away from a completed work. In terms of font size, if it is too small in two-page mode (landscape) then that's what single-page mode (portrait) is for.</p>
<p>The areas that need to be improved, according to Craig Mod:&Acirc;&nbsp;Hyphenation, Ragged Right Text, Smarter Margins, Copy and Paste.
