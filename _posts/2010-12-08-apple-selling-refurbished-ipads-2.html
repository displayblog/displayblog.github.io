<p><a href="http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/specialdeals/ipad/wi_fi_3g?mco=MjAzMTE2MTE">Apple</a>: The 16GB WiFi-only iPad is US$429.00, a $70 savings. The 16GB 3G iPad is just $579, $50 off. Given the chance, I prefer refurbished models because whatever was going to break broke and Apple fixed it. You get it for way cheaper, too. The only downside as far as I can tell is that you get a boring box instead of the pretty retail one.</p>
