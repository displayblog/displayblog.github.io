<p><em>Update:</em> <a href="http://www.google.com/nexus/#!/index">Official site</a> for the Nexus S.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/06/google-nexus-s-review/">TechCrunch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the last few days I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve been using the Google Nexus S, manufactured by Samsung, with the new Android 2.3 &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Gingerbread&acirc;&euro; operating system. This is a phone that was designed with direct input from the Google Android team. And like its predecessor, the Nexus One, which was released in January 2010, it has a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;clean&acirc;&euro; install of Android.</blockquote></p>
<p>Ah, a clean install of Android. But, what's so special about Gingerbread? According to <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-2.3-highlights.html">Android Developers</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simpler UI: Notification bar, menus, and other parts of the UI will sport a black background. This UI change will also let OLED-based Android smartphones to last a bit longer.</li>
<li>More Intuitive Text Input: Reshaped, reposiitoned keys. Multitouch key-chording, like on iOS. An example would be pressing Shift+<letter> to capitalize.</letter></li>
<li>Simpler Copy & Paste: Like iOS, press-hold to select a word, and then drag the (ugly) boundaries to select more.</li>
<li>More Aggressive Power Management: Android will kill "apps that are keeping the device awake for too long or that are consuming CPU while running in the background."</li>
<li>Internet Calling: To users with SIP accounts. What are SIP accounts? I wasn't even sure what SIP stood for. So I googled and found out. SIP is "Session Initiation Protocol," which means nothing to me. To me SIP is just another way to call people. You get a SIP number and you can call other folks with SIP numbers using the Internet. Cheap, as long as you have a cheap Internet connection.</li>
<li>Near-Field Communications: NFC for short. With a Gingerbread Android phone with NFC wireless hardware, like the Google Nexus S, you could swipe your phone to pay for stuff.</li>
<li>Multiple Cameras: I thought this was already supported.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>The Google Nexus S is just a rebranded and enhanced Samsung Galaxy S with Gingerbread. It has the same 4-inch 800x480 PenTile Matrix Super AMOLED display. If you read a lot on your smartphone and enjoy crisp text I would recommend the iPhone 4 or even the latest iPod touch. The Nexus S will be available at Best Buy and will work on the T-Mobile GSM network in the US. Expect a December 16 release.</p>
