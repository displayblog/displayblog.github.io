<p><a href="http://www.umid.co.kr/">UMID</a>: On November 11, 2008, UMID unveiled its Mobile Internet Device (MID) during the Global Mobile Vision 2008 (GMV 2008) conference that was held at the Seoul Imperial Palace hotel. UMID is based in South Korea and manufactures other devices such as UMPCs and PMPs. UMID's MID has a 4.8" touch LCD with a pixel format of 1024x600. Gallery after the jump.</p>
<p>The MID is powered by a 1.1GHz or 1.33GHz Atom CPU with either 512MB or 1GB RAM (DDR2 533MHz). The folks over at UMID refers to its MID as "a notebook PC that's as small as an electronic dictionary" (paraphrased translation). Another cool feature of this device is the ability to receive broadcast signals from Korea's DMB, Europe's DVB-T and Japan's 1-Seg systems. A 1.3MP webcam is built-in as well. UMID's MID will be available in 2009.</p>
