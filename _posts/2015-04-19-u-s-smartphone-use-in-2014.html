<p><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/us-smartphone-use-in-2015/">Aaron Smith, Pew Research Center</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>10% of Americans own a smartphone but <em>do not have any other form of high-speed internet access at home</em> beyond their phone&acirc;&euro;&trade;s data plan.</blockquote></p>
<p>My guess is that 10% of smartphone owners in the U.S. have a data plan that's unlimited or close to it. I have T-Mobile with an unlimited data plan, and it is truly unlimited, but broadband through Comcast has a data limit. Also interestingly enough, my 50Mbps Comcast connection is often slower, sometimes way slower, than my T-Mobile LTE connection.</p>
<p>You can do a lot of things on a smartphone: watch TV, movies, work on simple documents, spreadsheets, presentations, update websites, blog, draw, pay bills, and do many other things. The smartphone may not be the most convenient tool for some of those tasks, but it is at least possible.</p>
<p>There is at least one thing you do on a smartphone that is much easier than the alternative: taking photographs, making them pretty, and sharing them with loved ones.</p>
