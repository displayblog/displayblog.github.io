<p>Myriam Joire, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/08/15/motorola-photon-4g-review/">Engadget</a>:</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A bevy of sensors rounds things off (light, proximity, orientation, accelerometer, magnetometer and gyroscope), along with the same gorgeous 4.3-inch qHD (960x540 pixel) TFT panel that we first saw on the Droid X2. While Motorola cheats a bit by using a PenTile display, it matters little in practice -- the screen is bright even in direct sunlight, with beautiful colors, ink-like blacks and wide viewing angles.</p><br />

<p>In one of Engadget's closeup photos of the Motorola Photon 4G you can clearly see the pixelation around the Google search window edges and the Launcher icon dialogue balloon. More evidence of the not-so-gorgeousness can be found by looking closely at the icons on the top bar: ZZZ 4G, the battery indicator, etc. You'll see a lot of zaggies around the edges. To me, these things matter. It matters to <a href="http://ignorethecode.net/blog/2011/05/09/pentile_oled_screens/">Lukas Mathis</a>, too.</p></p>
