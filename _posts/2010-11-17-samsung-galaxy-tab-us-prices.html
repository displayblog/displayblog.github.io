<blockquote><p>Then again, if you're the kind who prefers to be unrestrained and plan to spend $600 regardless, it's Verizon with the most competitive data plans overall. And of course, your decision will undoubtedly be influenced by network performance in your area.</blockquote></p>
<p>It really depends on how much data you'll be using. I've seen myself blast through 250MB in 10 days on my iPhone 4. That's a 750MB per month run rate. If I kept my iPad I'm sure I'd be using a lot more data than that. Although AT&T's total cost for two years came out the lowest with the $25 for 2GB plan, that wouldn't help me one bit since there is hardly any AT&T 3G signals where I live.</p>
