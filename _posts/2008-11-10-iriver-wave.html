<p><a href="http://product.iriver.co.kr/p_w10_over.asp">iriver</a>: iriver is getting into the "smartphone" market. The company's 'wave' looks fantastic. The front is similar in design to Apple's iPhone in that there is a single button, a speaker slit for your ears and a display that takes up a good chunk of the overall area of the front. The LCD is a bit smaller at 3-inch versus 3.5-inch for the iPhone. The pixel format is slightly less at 480x272 versus 480x320 for the iPhone. Now what is very different from the iPhone is that the wave is not really a smartphone in the normal sense of the word. Although you can voice communicate, the wave relies on a WiFi connection to do so. At least that's what I think since I cannot seems to find any information regarding the baseband feature: whether it is a CDMA or GSM phone.</p>
<p>In South Korea, you'll need to sign up with KT to get Internet Telephone Service. The base monthly price is a reasonable KRW2000 but it adds up quickly as you use the service. For instance, a connection to a domestic (that would be South Korea) landline phone number will cost the user KRW39 per 3 minutes. The same pricing structure applies to other 070 numbers. In South Korea there are specific numbers that are given out for mobile phones. For instance, a 070-123-4567 number will mean that it is a mobile phone number. In the US you wouldn't know whether 408-123-4567 was a landline or a mobile phone number. Continuing with the cost: KRW10 per 10 seconds if you're connected to other non-070 mobile phones. SMS? KRW10 per to 070 Internet phone users and landlines; KRW15 per message for other mobile phones. I've heard of teenagers racking up KRW200,000 in one month. Easy.</p>
<p>So the wave is a portable multimedia player that gives you the ability to voice communicate via WiFi: a WiFi Phone. Now the interesting part about all of this is that I had a very difficult time finding WiFi signals when I took my original iPhone there last year. The only WiFi connection was a paid one through Starbucks locations. I am guessing SK is building out WiFi hotspots around the country much like T-Mobile did in the early days and now AT&amp;T.</p>
