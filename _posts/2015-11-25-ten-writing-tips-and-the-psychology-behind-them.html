<p>[ <a href="http://withoutbullshit.com/blog/10-top-writing-tips-psychology/">Without Bullshit</a> ] Here's the first three:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write shorter. Because readers are impatient.</li>
<li>Shorten your sentences. Because long sentences puzzle readers.</li>
<li>Rewrite passive voice. Because passive hides true meaning.</li><br />
</ol><br />
Good tips overall, but I don't think DISPLAYBLOG readers are impatient. And I don't think you get easily puzzled by long sentences either. But I do believe every word and every sentence should deserve to be there. Being succinct is a lot more readable than being long winded. The third point is good. The other seven tips are solid, too.</p>
