<p>Ya Hsin will ship 15" and 17" LCD monitors with LED backlights next month. Where will it ship these to? Four brands in the US, Japan and Europe. Now, let's think about this for a moment. We buy 15" and 17" LCD monitors because they are cheap. Also we don't want to feel like we're behind our neighbors by keeping our 600-pound CRT monitors. By replacing the conventional CCFL backlights with LED backlights will make 15" and 17" LCD monitors really expensive: try 1.5x to 2x. Will people still buy them? Not me. If I wanted quality LCD monitors, I would go with a 20" or larger LCD monitor that has Super IPS. That would be a better investment than going with a $400 15" LCD monitor with LED backlights. If the prices weren't that much more (up to $50 more?) I might consider purchasing LCD monitors that give me close to 100% NTSC, but that's probably not going to happen.</p>
