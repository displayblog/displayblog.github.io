<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-8760 aligncenter" title="OLPC_XO3_Tablet" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/OLPC_XO3_Tablet.jpg" alt="OLPC_XO3_Tablet" width="480" height="428" /></p></p>
<p>OLPC is getting into the tablet game with its XO-3 concept, designed by Yves Behar. The target price? US$75. The XO-3 concept is sized 8.5 x 11-inch and sports a ring that folds for kids to hold on to it. Induction charging, <1W power consumption, a thickness of about 0.5 inches, and Pixel Qi's display are part of the initial specs. Target date is 2012.</p>
<p>But before the XO-3 there will be the XO-1.5, an update of the current version, slated for a January release for $200. And then there will be the XO-1.75 in early 2011 sporting a 8.9-inch touch-enabled display and be priced around $175.
