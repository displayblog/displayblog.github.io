<p>The Cowon X7 is an interesting gadget. It packs a 4.3-inch touch-enabled display and sports a 160GB HDD. Battery life is rated at an incredible 103 hours for music and 10 hours for video. Priced at US$304. Does anyone really want to take yet another gadget if you're already toting a smartphone that's about the same size, make phone calls, surf the Internet and instantly buy music, videos, and books? And if you don't already have a smartphone I'm guessing you're eyeing the iPod touch as your PMP of choice. Source: <a href="http://product.cowon.com/">Cowon</a></p>
