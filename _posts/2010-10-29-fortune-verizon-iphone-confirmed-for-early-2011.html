<p>Sarah Ellison, <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/10/29/verizon_iphone_seidenberg/">Fortune</a>, on the Verizon iPhone:</p>
<blockquote><p>Verizon, sources say, will sell its own version of the iPhone 4, which will work on Verizon's CDMA-based 3G network. Unfortunately for globe trotters, the first version of the phone likely won't be built to work outside the U.S. -- it probably won't carry a special chip that can turn it into a "world phone."</blockquote></p>
<p>I live in an area where AT&T is simply terrible. Just this morning I was not able to get any 3G connection so I had to switch over to 2G, which is slow but more dependable. I'm paying $25 per month for this fast 3G connection that AT&T brags about. Can I take much more of this? Probably not. If I trust this Fortune article to be true then I best be heading back to the Apple Store to return my iPhone 4.</p>
<p>An interesting tidbit: According to Lowell McAdam, COO at Verizon Wireless, the average Droid user consumes more data than the average iPhone user.</p>
