<blockquote><p>Gran Turismo 5 is a 10/10 simulator wrapped up in a 5/10 game &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; driving is as exhilarating as anything that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s gone before, and slavish obsession with the minutiae of many of its cars ensure it's an encyclopaedia of automotive delights. Its brilliance on the track, however is matched by its sloppiness off of it, and there&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a lack of polish that would at one time have seemed sacrilegious to the series. Ultimately its driving wins out to ensure that it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s still a great game, but it leaves that nagging doubt; this could have been a masterpiece were it not for the fact that Polyphony was so absorbed with the detail that it took its eye off the ball.</blockquote></p>
<p>In the case of GT5 and all of the previous GT versions the simulator makes the game. If you have a PlayStation 3, GT5 is a must-have if you want the best driving game on the planet. US$59.99</p>
