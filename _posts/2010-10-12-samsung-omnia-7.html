<p>The Samsung Omnia 7 sports a massive 4-inch Super AMOLED display with a pixel format of 800x480 PenTile Matrix. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/11/samsung-omnia-7-first-hands-on/">Engadget</a> on the Omnia 7's performance:</p>
<blockquote><p>As to performance, we've nothing to say that we haven't said about the other WP7 launch devices, it's blindingly, ridiculously, <em>delightfully</em> quick.</blockquote></p>
<p>From what I can see WP7 phones are much more responsive than Android 2.2 phones. Compared to the iPhone 4 I think they are about the same.</p>
<p>Samsung as well as every other smartphone manufacturer is inspired by Apple's iPhone. There is little doubt. Many aspects of the iPhone have been copied and now it's down to the button:</p>
<blockquote><p>The depressed Windows key is basically identical to the iPhone's, dare we say it, iconic home button.</blockquote></p>
