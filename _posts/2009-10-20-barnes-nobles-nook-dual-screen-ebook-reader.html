<p>Barnes &amp; Noble is claiming its Nook ebook reader is the planet's "most advanced e-book reader". The dimensions of the Nook are 7.7x4.9x0.5 inches and it weighs just 11.2 ounces. The unique feature about the Nook is the 6-inch 16-level E Ink Vizplex electronic paper display (EPD) on top and a 3.5-inch capacitive touch LCD on the bottom. The OS running the touch LCD? Android. Genius.</p>
<p>The Nook is expected to last for up to 10 days without wireless connectivity, which include WiFi BG and AT&amp;T's 3G. There is 2GB of internal storage and other features include: microSD, MP3 player, 3.5mm headphone jack, microUSB and a built-in speaker. Supported formats include EPUB, PDF, MP3. Here's the really intriguing part: just like how we currently experience Barnes &amp; Noble, Nook owners can walk into a real store, connect via WiFi and browse complete ebooks. For free.</p>
<p>There is a 'LendMe' feature that allows lending of books for a day at a time to other ebook readers, mobile phones and computers. Barnes &amp; Noble also has ereader apps for the iPhone and BlackBerry. The Nook is available for preorder for US$259. Initial shipments are expected to commence at the end of November.</p>
<p>There's a <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/nook/?cds2Pid=30919">really well-made video</a> that goes through most of the important features at Barnes &amp; Noble.</p>
