<p><a href="http://investor.palm.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=583747">HP</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>HP today announced that the Wi-Fi version of HP TouchPad will be available in the United States on July 1.</p>
<p>HP's first webOS tablet will be available in the United Kingdom, Ireland, France and Germany a few days later and in Canada in mid-July, with availability scheduled to follow later this year in Italy and Spain, as well as in Australia, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Singapore.</p>
<p>HP TouchPad will be available from U.S. retailers, commercial resellers and direct from HP with the option of either 16 GB or 32 GB of internal storage for $499.99 and $599.99, respectively. Preorders in North America and Europe will begin June 19.</blockquote></p>
<p>In light of iOS 5, OS X Lion, and iCloud the HP TouchPad proposition seems to be dead on arrival, which is already way too late. And if rumors are correct Apple is working on the next iPad, called the iPad 3 or something else, that will most likely be announced about two months after the TouchPad touches down. But if you're a big webOS fan you can pre-order the TouchPad starting June 19.</p>
