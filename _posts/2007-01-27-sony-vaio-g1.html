<p>Sony's G1 is an ultra-portable notebook PC that uses carbon fiber to reduce weight to below 2lbs: 1.97lbs without the optical drive and 2.17lbs with. Prices start at $2000 and can climb to around $3000. <a href="http://www.dynamism.com/g1/pricing.shtml">Dynamism</a> is one of the few places where you can purchase the G1. The specifications are pretty impressive for such a diminutive notebook: intel U1400 Core Solo at 1.2GHz or U1300 at 1.06GHz, 512MB of RAM up to 1.5GB, integrated Intel 945 GMS Express GPU, 80GB HD spinning at 4200 RPM. The display is a 12.1" TFT LCD with a pixel format of 1024 x 768 and can display 16 million colors. The G1 can output up to 1600 x 1200 pixels with 16 million colors. The design is simple and quite nice and comes in three colors: white, black and brown. <a href="http://www.popgadget.net/2007/01/face_time_sony.php">popgadget</a> has a decent review of the G1 and gives it much praise for its lack of weight.</p>
<p>There are just a few things that I would like to see in subsequent G1 revisions:</p>
<p>1) a 12.1" wide TFT LCD with 1280 x 800 sporting LEDs instead of CCFLs<br />
2) either a 100GB HDD spinning at 5400 RPM or a 64GB solid state disk (SSD)<br />
3) EV-DO or HSPDA built-in support</p>

Sony's VAIO G1 is the G11 in Europe. The G11&Acirc;&nbsp; will sport a new lid color: black. Sony is also claiming that the G11 will survive a 90cm or 35" drop. Whether or not the carbon fiber casing helps with shock resistance, I don't know. The battery rating is at 9 for on the road, which is a different statistic compared to the G1 that has 6 hours for a normal capacity battery and 12.5 hours for the extended. There is an upgraded CPU with Intel's ULV Core Solo U1500 1.33GHz and a 100HD (yay! one of my three wishes came true!). The 12.1" XGA LCD sports a cool LED backlight (the second wish has come true!). It seems the memory ceiling has been increased to 2GB from 1.5GB. Cool. Now where's my EV-DO or HDPDA?</p>
