<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5037" style="margin-right: 5px;" title="kanazawa_institute_of_technology_green_phosphor_oled_material" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/kanazawa_institute_of_technology_green_phosphor_oled_material.jpg" alt="kanazawa_institute_of_technology_green_phosphor_oled_material" width="176" height="213" />A group of researchers from the Kanazawa Institute of Technology in Japan succeeded in developing a green phosphor-based <a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3Autpr0mvi0e9&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=oled&amp;sa=Search">OLED</a>. What's the big deal? The light-emitting efficiency they achieved with this new OLED was 210lm/W (that's lumens per watt) at 10 cd/m2 (or nits) of luminance. That number is almost a 57% improvement over existing OLEDs.</p>
<p>Based on a bottom-emission type using a 0.7mm glass plate, the light-emitting layer is made up of a host material called "CBP". An iridium complex is added to it and peak emission wavelengths are between 500 and 550nm, corresponding to the green color.</p>
<p>Without the 0.7mm glass plate that is highly refractive the light-emitting efficiency was only 93.3lm/W. The researchers concluded that the glass plate was responsible for more than doubling the light extraction efficiency.</p>
