<p>In an interview with <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-04/googles-page-apples-android-pique-for-show#p2">Businesweek's Brad Stone</a>, Larry Page:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think the Android differences were actually for show. [...] I think that served their interests. For a lot of companies, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s useful for them to feel like they have an obvious competitor and to rally around that.</blockquote></p>
<p>Why would Apple rally its iPhone efforts around Android? That sounds brain-dead. <a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/apple-business/news/?newsid=3349384">Karen Haslam, MacWorld UK</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Isaacson continued: &acirc;&euro;&oelig;It's almost copied verbatim by Android. And then they licence it around promiscuously. And then Android starts surpassing Apple in market share, and this totally infuriated him. It wasn't a matter of money. He said: 'You can't pay me off, I'm here to destroy you'.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>To be even more clear, here's what Jobs told Isaacson in <em>Steve Jobs</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Our lawsuit is saying, &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Google, you fucking ripped off the iPhone, wholesale ripped us off.&acirc;&euro;&trade; Grand theft. I will spend my last dying breath if I need to, and I will spend every penny of Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s $40 billion in the bank, to right this wrong. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m going to destroy Android, because it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a stolen product. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m willing to go to thermonuclear war on this. They are scared to death, because they know they are guilty. Outside of Search, Google&acirc;&euro;&trade;s products &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; Android, Google Docs &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; are shit.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>That's as clear as you can get: Steve Jobs wanted Android annihilated.</p>
