<blockquote><p>The brand and range of appliances aim to create a culture of repair amongst their users. This brings together not only the manufacturers knowledge of the product but also that of the user. This culture is created through a website and forum which allow the user to share knowledge, learn, buy new parts and ultimately carry out their own repairs.</blockquote></p>
<p>Kind of like iFixit but for everything. Speaking of iFixit, that's where I go to learn how to fix my Mac gear. Just yesterday I mustered up enough courage to open up my Mac mini. It wasn't easy but thanks to iFixit I was able to open it up, de-dust, and upgrade the hard drive to a SSD. The little bugger is even quieter and <em>much</em> faster.</p>
