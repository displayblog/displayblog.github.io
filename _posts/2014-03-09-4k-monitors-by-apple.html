<p><a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2014/03/07/os-x-10-9-3-retina-option-4k-displays/">Richard Padilla, MacRumors</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple's OS X Mavericks 10.9.3 beta appears to have built-in support that enables all compatible 4K displays to be set at a "Retina" resolution, with an option for 60Hz output. The compatibility was first discovered by Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/KhaosT/status/441761032436846593">@KhaosT</a>, and was tested with both the Late 2013 Retina MacBook Pro and redesigned Mac Pro in conjunction with <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2013/12/02/24-inch-4k-display-from-dell-priced-at-1399-28-inch-4k-model-coming-at-under-1000/">Dell's UltraSharp 24 Ultra HD Monitor</a>.</blockquote></p>
