<blockquote><p>In an interview with Dow Jones Newswires, Shin spilled that the company plans to release a 4G LTE-capable version of the Galaxy Tab later this year.</blockquote></p>
<p>That would be J.K. Shin, the top guy running Samsung mobile. Why would you jeopardize sales of the Galaxy Tab 8.9 and 10.1 by pre-announcing a better product that will be available in just a few months? If you are patient, in less then six months and more likely closer to five, you'll be able to get your hands on a Samsung Galaxy Tab that connects to 4G. This bit of information is critical since purchasing a Galaxy Tab often means you'll be tethered to a very long two-year contract.</p>
<p>I prefer how Apple's doing it: iPads with no contract. This way you can always get the newest and greatest iPad without having to pay early termination fees or paying outrageously expensive prices. You can also reduce the hit on your wallet by selling your older iPad on eBay or Craigslist.</p>
