<p><a href="http://www.antara.co.id/en/seenws/?id=16942">Antara News</a>: By September, Asahi will cut 35% of its CRT glass output capacity. The reason? Lower sales, lower prices, higher fuel and material costs. All production will end at its P.T. Video Display Glass Indonesia and Pacific Glass Corp. in Taiwan and four other locations. Panel and funnel production will continue in Singapore, Thailand, China and South Korea. Japan and US-based CRT glass production has already ended.</p></p>

<p>The slow death of CRT is a good thing: lots and lots of glass piling up all over the world. Plus, these things can electrocute you to death if not careful. Of course, millions upon millions of LCDs have mercury in them. I hope the transition to mercury-free LCDs with LED backlights become a reality really soon for notebook PCs, LCD monitors and LCD TVs.</p></p>
