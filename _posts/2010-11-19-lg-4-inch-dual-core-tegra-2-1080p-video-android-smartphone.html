<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/16/exclusive-lgs-4-inch-android-phone-with-dual-core-tegra-2-and/">Engadget</a>: LG is doing well with its budget-oriented Optimus One and in early 2011 the company seems to be poised to compete at the high end. Engadget is reporting some leaked shots of what looks like LG's top contender. The 4-inch Android smartphone is said to sport a dual-core CPU, NVIDIA's Tegra 2 graphics chipset, and an 8 megapixel camera that can capture 1080p video. On the software side, there is no mention of which Android version but whatever it is it should be close to bone stock. Let's hope the 4-inch display goes beyond 800x480 and is the first to hop on the next-generation of Android pixel formats: 1280x720.</p>
