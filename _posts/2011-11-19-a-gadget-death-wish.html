<p><a href="http://m.theatlantic.com/magazine/print/2011/09/replacement-therapy/8609/">Rob Walker, The Atlantic</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Imagine, by contrast, that tomorrow some company unveiled a cell phone guaranteed to last for 20 years. Who would genuinely want it? It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not our devices that wear thin, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s our patience with them.</blockquote></p>
<p>Me, me, me! I'll take one!</p>
<p>I've been experimenting with something and it's been about a week. It's not easy at all, but I needed to get to the bottom of it. I'm trying to figure out whether or not I can live without my iPhone.</p>
<p>Instead of harnessing the power of the phone that revolutionized the entire industry, I'm going whole hog tactile with a Motorola RAZR V3. <a href="/2011/11/17/touchscreens-have-no-hand/">Edward Tufte would be proud</a>.</p>
<p>If the answer turns out, yes, I can live without the iPhone then it would be really neat if the RAZR could last another 15 years. If the answer is no, I must have my iPhone, then maybe I wouldn't be too thrilled with a 20-year guarantee. We'll see by the end of the year.</p>
