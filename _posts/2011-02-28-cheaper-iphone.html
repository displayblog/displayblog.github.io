<p>Bernstein Research analyst Toni Sacconaghi, according to <a href="http://blogs.forbes.com/ericsavitz/2011/02/28/apple-plots-move-to-expand-iphones-market-share/">Eric Savitz</a> at Forbes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The analyst says Cook &acirc;&euro;&oelig;appeared to reaffirm the notion that Apple is likely to develop lower priced offerings&acirc;&euro; to expand the market for the iPhone. Cook said the company is planning &acirc;&euro;&oelig;clever things&acirc;&euro; to address the prepaid market, and that Apple did not want its products to be &acirc;&euro;&oelig;just for the rich,&acirc;&euro; and that the company is &acirc;&euro;&oelig;not ceding any market.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>The older-generation iPhone 3GS can be had for US$49. But that requires you to be chained to an expensive carrier subscription for two years. A <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/02/09/wait-for-the-next-iphone-iphone-4s/">LTE-only data iPhone</a> could do the trick since the voice portion of the cost of owning an iPhone is the largest. Theoretically, a data-only iPhone would not require a separate voice plan. But a quick and simple solution would be to sell the previous-generation iPhone unlocked, for not too much, right now.</p>
