<p>Source: <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/apple/inside-the-new-macbook-airs-screen/8523">ZDNet</a>. TechRestore CEO Shannon Jean:</p>
<blockquote><p>The screen is paper thin and it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not inside a housing like the traditional screens. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s in layers, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s insane. I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t think there&acirc;&euro;&trade;s ever been a screen like this used in a laptop. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s very similar to a Sony PSP screen, where the LCD panel and backlight are separate pieces.</blockquote></p>
<p>So Apple really <em>is</em> in the LCD cell business. Modularizing the LCD takes a lot of hands and time but the main purpose is to standardize. So you can drop it into different chassis. At times Apple can't make use of standardized modularized LCDs, the 11.6-inch MacBook Air being a case in point. With an impossibly thin unibody display chassis Apple found a way to make the LCD itself thin: get rid of all the unnecessary standard parts.</p>
