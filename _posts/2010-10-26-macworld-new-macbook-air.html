<p>Jason Snell, <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/155186/2010/10/macbook_air.html">Macworld</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But while the 11-inch Air is small and light, it doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t feel cramped. Part of that is due to the high-resolution display, which packs more pixels into its compact 11.6-inch diagonal screen than fit on the screen of that 13-inch white MacBook. Sporting a 16:9 aspect ratio (1366 by 768 pixels), it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a bit wider than most Apple laptop displays, and 768 pixels is the bare minimum number of vertical pixels you&acirc;&euro;&trade;d want in a modern Mac display. However, most modern Mac software has been designed with widescreen aspect ratios in mind&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and the extra width of the 16:9 display is what keeps it from not feeling cramped.</blockquote></p>
<p>I wish Mail was widescreen optimized: a three column option would be welcomed.</p>
