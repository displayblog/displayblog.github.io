<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-6289 aligncenter" title="apple_13inch_macbookpro" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/apple_13inch_macbookpro.jpg" alt="apple_13inch_macbookpro" width="500" height="276" /></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The aluminum 13-inch <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=macbook&amp;sa=Search">MacBook</a> has morphed into the 13-inch MacBook Pro. It was introduced today at Apple's WWDC. You can get up to 8GB of RAM, up to a 500GB hard disk or 128GB SSD, and a 72-percent NTSC color gamut 13-inch LCD. FireWire is back, the 800 kind (but not 400). In addition to FireWire, Apple squeezed in a SD card reader. That's nice and I know you can't cram everything into the left of a MacBook but how about a CF card reader if Apple really is targeting the professional photographers with the Pro model? Another 'feature' that I don't like is the integrated lithium polymer battery just like the one in the new 15.4-inch and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=17-inch+macbook+pro&amp;sa=Search">17-inch MacBook Pro</a>'s. Sure it allows the 13-inch MacBook Pro to last 7 hours, 2 more than the 13-inch MacBook, but a professional-grade notebook PC should really have a replaceable battery. Right? What is right is the price: starting at just $1199.</p></p>
