<p>Samsung showcased the 70" LCD TV panel at FPD International 2006. The 70" has a refresh rate of 120Hz, twice that of typical LCDs, and sports a pixel format of 1920 x 1080 and outputs 1080p. The 120Hz refresh rate is part of a system that is composed of other technologies to reduce the nagging problem in LCD TVs: motion blur. Samsung is planning to begin commercial production in early 2007.</p>
<p>This was a prototype showing the world that Samsung can indeed make 70" LCD TVs with its current G7 LCD fabs. What Samsung cannot showcase is a 70" LCD TV made at its G7 fab that is affordable. We will need to wait for its G8 fab to come online in the second half of 2007 to see prices in the sub-$10,000 range. Big is good, but at a price.</p>
