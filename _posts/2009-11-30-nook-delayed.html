<p>For those of you who pre-ordered the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=nook&amp;sa=Search#977">Nook</a>, the dual-display ereader from Barnes &amp; Noble, be happy: the company has upgraded you to overnight shipping and a US$10 Barnes&amp;Noble.com Online Gift Certificate. Why is the company being so nice? Because Barnes &amp; Noble is so sorry... that your Nook won't be shipping out today as promised; you'll need to wait until December 9th. At least, that's what Barnes &amp; Noble is expecting. Who knows what might actually happen. Source: <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-admin/post-new.php">ZDNet</a></p>
