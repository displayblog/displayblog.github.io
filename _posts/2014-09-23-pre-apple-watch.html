<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/09/23/bell">John Gruber</a>. <a href="https://medium.com/@ienjoy/september-8-2014-447fce0fc277">Jon Bell</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>After years of disappointments, the Moto 360 looks like a breath of fresh air. It&acirc;&euro;&tilde;s not that it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>good</em>, per se, but it has the notable distinction of being less bad than the things we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve seen before.</p>
<p>So while it still has bad battery life, and they can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t manage to render the UI in a real circle, we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve seen worse. As a result, the Verge gave it an 83, almost the same score as the 85 they gave the state-of-the-art Mac Pro. Ok, noted.</blockquote></p>
<p>The UI cannot be rendered in a real circle because <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/06/27/moto-360-fatally-flawed/">the display is not a real circle</a>. A product Motorola named Moto 360 &mdash; 360 because Motorola wanted the world to know the display is a circle &mdash; is in reality only 270 degrees a circle. Motorola gets an F for marketing. I too was ooh&acirc;&euro;&trade;ing at the Moto 360, up until I realized the display was only a partial circle.</p>
<p>What if in an alternate world Apple came out with the iWatch 360, and had the same non-circular 270-degree display? It would have been the beginning of the end for Apple.</p>
