<blockquote><p>Combined TFT-LCD net sales for the second quarter 2011 amounted to NT$ 121,696 million, a 2.1% decrease over the previous quarter&acirc;&euro;&trade;s NT$ 124,327 million. Gross loss was NT$ 6,625 million, for a gross margin of -5.4%. Operating loss totaled NT$ 12,900 million with an operating margin of -10.6%.</blockquote></p>
<p>CMI sales by application is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>TV: 39%</li>
<li>Desktop: 30%</li>
<li>Small & Medium: 19%</li>
<li>Notebook: 9%</li>
<li>Others: 3%</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>TV demand the world over, except for China, has been weak.</p>
<p>Sales by size:</p>
<ul>
<li><10": 20%</li>
<li>10 to <20": 23%</li>
<li>20 to <30": 27%</li>
<li>30 to <40": 15%</li>
<li>40"+: 15%</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>The majority of LCD monitor sizes can be assumed to be within the 20- to 30-inch range. It would also be safe to assume that TVs would be 30 inches and larger. Half of CMI TV sales were for smaller-sized units within the range of 30 to less than 40 inches.</p>

<blockquote><p>CMI plans to put a brake on planned capacity expansions for 2011 and therefore, capex for the year has been cut to the budget that will be used only for development of new technologies including in-plane switching (IPS), OLED, touch and LTPS (low-temperature polysilicon), said company CFO Eddie Chen during an August 4 investors meeting.</blockquote></p>
<p>2011 CAPEX will decrease from NT$70-80 billion to NT$50-60 billion.</p>
