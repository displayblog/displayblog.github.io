<p>Michael Rose, <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2014/09/02/think-iclouds-two-factor-authentication-protects-your-privacy/">TUAW</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[...] using a fresh (spun up and installed from scratch) Windows 8 virtual machine running on Parallels 10.</p>
<p>After installing the iCloud Control Panel for Windows (as seen above), I logged in with my iCloud credentials and checked off the options to synchronize bookmarks and photos with my new, never-before-seen PC. Within a few minutes, my photo stream photos downloaded neatly into the appropriate folders and my bookmarks showed up in my Windows-side browser, and nary a 2FA alert to be seen. I turned to my iCloud email account to wait for the obligatory "Your account was accessed from a new computer" courtesy alert... which never arrived.</blockquote></p>
<p>Not good.</p>
