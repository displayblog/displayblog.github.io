<p><a href="http://www.sony.co.jp/SonyInfo/News/Press/201102/11-021/">Sony</a> just unveiled the largest OLED displays money can buy: the Trimaster EL series professional monitors. The Trimaster EL OLED monitors come in two sizes: the 17-inch BVM-E170 and the 25-inch BVM-E250.</p>
<p>Both models have 1920x1080 pixel formats, a first for OLED displays, and use 10-bit OLED panels, good for billions of colors. Viewing angles are 178/178. I can only imagine, but I expect color and images to be amazing.</p>
<p>The smaller BVM-E170 will be available July 1st for &yen;1,312,500 (about US$15,700) and the bigger BVM-E250 on May 1st for &yen;2,415,000 (about US$28,900). The professional broadcast market is about the only market that could possibility bear these prices.</p>
<p>State-of-the-art displays? Yes. Ridiculously expensive? Absolutely.</p>
