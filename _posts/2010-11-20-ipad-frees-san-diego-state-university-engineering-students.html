<blockquote><p>By rebuilding its web server infrastructure to support virtual computing through Mobile Safari, almost all of the students at SDSU are able to do most of their work on the go, whether through the iPad, iPhone or Android (boo).</blockquote></p>
<p>Randall German, Associate Dean of the College of Engineering at the San Diego State University:</p>
<blockquote><p>It opens up the entire educational package. It makes education more accessible and more flexible. Now students who have childcare issues or have to be at a job, can do their work on their own time, rather than waiting in line for a computer in the lab. It really opens up opportunities for a new kind of student.</blockquote></p>
