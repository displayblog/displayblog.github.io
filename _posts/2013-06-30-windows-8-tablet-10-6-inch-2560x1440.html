<p>Tom Warren, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/27/4471922/microsoft-surface-hints-7-inch-high-resolution-tablets">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Although the list, used in the company's developer tools for testing, wasn't exhaustive, one particular resolution and screen size caught our eye: a 10.6-inch display running at 2560 x 1440.</blockquote></p>
<p>Tiny text and icons? Or right sized but messed up text and icons with more clarity? I hope Microsoft gets it right this time.</p>
