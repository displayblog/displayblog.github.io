<p>David Pogue, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/11/technology/personaltech/11pogue.html">The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Samsung sweated the details on this thing. The screen is gorgeous. The touch response is immediate and reliable. The whole thing is superfast and a pleasure to use.</blockquote></p>
