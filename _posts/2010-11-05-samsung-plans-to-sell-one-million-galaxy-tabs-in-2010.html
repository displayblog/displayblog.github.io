<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6A34MT20101104">Reuters</a>: Not only that, Samsung will be bringing out 10-inch Galaxy Tabs to compete directly with the 9.7-inch iPad. The company originally expected 18 million smartphones to be sold in 2010 but has upped it to 20 million thanks in large part to the popular Galaxy S. In 2011 Samsung plans to sell 40 million smartphones.</p>
