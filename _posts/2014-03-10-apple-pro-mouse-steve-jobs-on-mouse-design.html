<p><a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/269222/steve-jobs-hated-idea-multi-button-mouse-designer-claims/">Cult of Mac</a>: Former senior mechanical engineer of product design at Apple, Abraham Farag shares how he and his team ended up with the Apple Pro Mouse:</p>
<blockquote><p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;It all started with a model we did not have time to finish,&acirc;&euro; he says. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;We had made six of these great form models to show Steve,&acirc;&euro; he recalls. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;They were fully done, with all the parting lines cut in for buttons and different plastic parts, and all the colors just right.&acirc;&euro; At the last minute, the design team had decided to create a model that would echo the look of the Topolino mouse which shipped prior to the hockey puck. The only problem was, the model wasn't finished. They hadn't had time to draw buttons on to the model to indicate where they would go.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;It looked like a grey blob,&acirc;&euro; Farag says. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;We were going to put that model into a box so people wouldn't see it.&acirc;&euro; However, when Jobs turned up things went awry.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Steve looked at the lineup of potential forms and made straight for the unfinished one,&acirc;&euro; Farag says.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;That's genius,&acirc;&euro; he said. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;We don't want to have any buttons.&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;That's right, Steve,&acirc;&euro; someone else piped up. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;No buttons at all.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
