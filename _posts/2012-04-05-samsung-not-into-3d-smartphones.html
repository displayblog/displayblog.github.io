<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/04/05/samsung-were-still-not-into-3d-smartphones/">Samsung's statement to Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Although Samsung Electronics is constantly exploring new technologies for our mobile devices, we have no immediate plan to include displays featuring 3D technology in our upcoming smartphones.</blockquote></p>
<p>Smart call. Who would want to be tortured by a 3D display all day long?</p>
