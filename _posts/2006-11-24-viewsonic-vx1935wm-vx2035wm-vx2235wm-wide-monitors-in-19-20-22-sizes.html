<p>Viewsonic has announced three new wide LCD monitors: VX1935wm, VX2035wm, VX2235wm. Here are the specs:</p>
<p>VX1935wm: 19", 1440 x 900, 5ms response time, 700:1 CR, 300 cd/m2<br />
VX2035wm: 20", 1680 x 1050, 5ms, 800:1 CR, 300 cd/m2<br />
VX2235wm: 22", 1680 x 1050, 5ms, 700:1 CR, 280 cd/m2</p>
<p>And the prices:</p>
<p>VX1935wm: $199<br />
VX2035wm: $349<br />
VX2235wm: $399</p>
<p>All three have stereo speaker options, have fairly thin bezels and integrated power supplies. All three have both DVI and VGA connections. But I'm not quite understanding what Viewsonic's product strategy is here with these three new wide LCD monitors, especially with the 20" and 22" versions. They have the same resolution with 1680 x 1050. The 20" wide has a better contrast ratio and higher brightness. Would you pay $50 more money for two more inches of less contrast and brightness? I sure wouldn't!</p>

<p>It wasn't mentioned in Engadget, but I would like these new monitors to have height adjustment. One of the best ways to work in a correct posture is to have displays at the correct eye-level.</p>
