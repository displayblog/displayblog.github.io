<p><a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/iphone-india-versus-china-week-daily-updates/">Ben Thompson</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple is indeed the preferred vendor for people at the top of the market, but because the iPhone is priced (about) the same everywhere in the world, its market share is a function of a country&acirc;&euro;&trade;s average income and the way in which that income is distributed.</blockquote></p>
<p>Makes sense.</p>
