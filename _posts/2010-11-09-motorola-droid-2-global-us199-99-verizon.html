<p><a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com:80/b2c/store/controller?item=phoneFirst&action=viewPhoneDetail&selectedPhoneId=5568&capId=&phoneTopRated=">Verizon</a> &rarr; <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/09/motorola-droid-2-global-now-available-at-verizon-for-199/">Engadget</a>: The Motorola Droid 2 Global is available early at Verizon for $199.99 with a new two-year contract and after a $100 mail-in rebate. The globetrotting phone was originally rumored for a November 11th release. The Droid 2 Global sports a fast 1.2GHz Snapdragon, a 3.7-inch TFT LCD with a 854x480 16:9 IPS LCD, the good kind, and a slide-out QWERTY keyboard. Other notable specs include: 3G mobile hotspot for up to five devices, Skype Mobile, 5 megapixel camera with auto-focus, touch-to-focus, and DVD-D1 video capture (means 720x480 at 30fps), a slight letdown. Motorola seems to be able to make it in white.</p>
