<p>[ <a href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/testing-apples-29w-usb-c-power-adapter-and-ipad-pro-fast-charging/">MacStories</a> ] Federico Viticci:</p>
<blockquote><p>The 29W USB-C power adapter with fast charging on the iPad Pro isn't only capable of quickly charging an iPad Pro while its screen is turned off &ndash; most notably, it can both sustain <em>and</em> power the device <em>considerably</em> while it's working hard used at full brightness. The 29W adapter is remarkably consistent in battery gains in a variety of conditions and it dramatically reduces the amount of time required to charge the iPad Pro.</blockquote></p>
<p>The iPad Pro takes a long time to charge: 3.5 hours to 80% using the included 12W power adapter. But use the MacBook's 29W USB-C power adapter, with a USB-C to Lightning cable, and you get to 80% in just 1.5 hours. You save 2 hours every time for $74 ($25 Apple's 1-meter USB-C to Lightning Cable + $49 Apple's 29W USB-C Power Adapter). I think it's worth the investment, especially if you depend on your iPad Pro all day long.</p>
