<p>Heptagon is a Finland-based micro-optics specialist and has established a US subsidiary located in San Jose, CA. Heptagon manufactures miniature optics for LED lighting and the US subsidiary will be a sales, marketing and business development office. With LED there are multiple challenges including: increasing light efficiency, package reduction, function optimization and cost of ownership reduction. Heptagon has developed both micro-optical elements and monolithic micro-optics. The company's monolithic micro-optics integrate micro-optics on the LED device without requiring assembly and can be fabricated on the LED wafer itself.</p>
