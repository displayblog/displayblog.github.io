<p><strong>Cool Tool</strong> Pro-Camera is an app that brings advanced features to your <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=iphone&amp;sa=Search">iPhone</a>: self-timer, digital zoom and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=image+stabilization&amp;sa=Search">image stabilization</a>. Digital zoom is probably not going to be all that great since even in dedicated cameras it doesn't help that much: you'd want something real--an optical zoom. The self-timer is kind of cool: you could put your iPhone on a tripod, set the self-timer, click, run to your friend and then get yourself in the picture. But the features that makes Pro-Camera true to its name are image stabilization and "Night Images".</p>
<p><strong>Image Stabilization</strong> By taking advantage of the built-in accelerometer, Pro-Camera detects your jitters and stabilizes the image. Image-stabilized images coming out of your iPhone sounds terrific. There is also a nifty option to overlay a grid so you can line up the horizon; it's called 'tiltmeter'.</p>
<p><strong>"Night Images"</strong> is a feature that cleans up low-light photos. The process isn't documented but there is probably some algorithm to reduce noise. I've seen some low-light photos from the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22iphone+3gs%22&amp;sa=Search">iPhone 3GS</a> and they look pretty good. Even the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22iphone+3g%22&amp;sa=Search">iPhone 3G</a> does a decent job with low-light photography. With just a touch of noise reduction and without eliminating too much detail the "Night Images" feature might come in real handy.&Acirc;&nbsp;Just $3 gets you Pro-Camera. I think it is quite worth it.</p>
