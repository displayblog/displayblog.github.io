<p><a href="http://www.geekstuff4u.com/kohjinsha-dual-screen-dz-series.html">Geek Stuff 4u</a> <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.akihabaranews.com/en/news_details.php">Akihabara News</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/11/27/kohjinshas-dual-sceen-dz-series-laptop-now-for-sale/">Engadget</a>: Kohjinsha's DZ series notebook PCs sport two 10.1-inch TFT LCDs each with a 1024x600 resolution. The two LCDs slide out to make for an expansive display with a 2048x600 pixel format. The separate displays also make for much simpler window management as it requires just maximizing the window within the LCD. Another good move by Kohjinsha is the pixel format of 1024x600 as it makes it convenient to browse through most website without having to scroll sideways; you will need to scroll up and down quite a bit. And if you're a blogger or someone that likes to work on a document with multiple sources open, this dual display solution can definitely boost productivity.</p>
<p>The overall package isn't too bulky with a max thickness of 1.65 inches and a weight of 4.09 pounds. Other specs include: 1.6GHz AMD Athlon Neo, RS780MN chipset, ATI Radeon HD 3200 GPU, WiFi BGN, USB (3), 1.3 megapixel webcam, 1GB RAM (4GB max), 160GB 5400 RPM hard drive, 5200mAh battery good for up to 4.5 hours. You have a choice of Linux (don't know which distro) or Windows 7 Home Premium 32-bit for an extra &Acirc;&yen;5,000 (about US$58). The dual 10-inch LCD wielding notebook PC from Kohjinsha is priced at &Acirc;&yen;95,800 (about $1107) and currently shipping worldwide: it will cost around $60 to the US and &acirc;&sbquo;&not;50 to Europe and take around three weeks.</p>
