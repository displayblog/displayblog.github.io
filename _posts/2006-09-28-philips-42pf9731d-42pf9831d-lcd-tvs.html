<p>Philips introduced two 42&acirc;&euro;&sup3; LCD TV models during CEDIA, the 42PF9731D and the 42PF9831D. Both have a dynamic contrast ration of 4,500:1, brightness of 550 cd/m2, and a limited resolution of 1366 x 768. At the 42&acirc;&euro;&sup3;-level, I think almost everyone expects the resolution to be 1920 x 1080. What&acirc;&euro;&trade;s up Philips?</p>

<p>The two units, on the other hand, sport more-or-less useless stuff like a 7-in-1 media card reader. Other than geeks, who shoves media cards into their TVs? I know of no one. There are two HDMI ports. Both of these units have AmbiLight. MSRPs are $2,699 for the 42PF9731D and $3,499 for the 42PF9831D. The more expensive 42PF9831D is probably because it has a AmbiLight Full Surround capability, instead of just Ambilight Surround.</p>
