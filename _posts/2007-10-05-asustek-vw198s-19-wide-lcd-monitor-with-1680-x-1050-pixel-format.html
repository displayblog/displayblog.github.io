<p class="P1">Asustek Computer recently launched three new LCD monitors in Taiwan according to DigiTimes. The three LCD monitors include one 19" and two 22" LCD monitors, all three sporting wide aspect ratios. According to Asustek, the 19" wide VW198S is the world's first with a pixel format of 1680 x 1050. Typically, a 19" wide LCD monitor would be limited to a pixel format of just 1440 x 900. With a typical non-wide, 5:4 aspec ratio, 19" LCD monitor sporting a 1280 x 1024 pixel format.</p></p>
<p class="P1">If you've been looking for some extra display real estate (in terms of pixels, not size), Asus' VW198S might just be the ticket. Just one caveat: for those of you with less than perfect eyes, the fonts on Windows and OS X will be smaller compared to a 19" wide with 1440 x 900 or 1280 x 1024. If you are OK with that, then the added bonus of just $224 will certainly help in making the decision. There has been no mention of the VW198S and the other 22" LCD monitors becoming available in the US.</p></p>
<p class="P1">The other two monitors are both 22" wide (VW222S $304, VW222U $347) with the same pixel format of 1680 x 1050. Brightness, contrast ratio, viewing angle, and colors are all the same as the 19". The only difference are faster response time (19" 5ms vs. 22" 2ms) and that the VW222U sports a DVI-HDCP in addition to a VGA port, which tack on an extra $43.</p></p>
