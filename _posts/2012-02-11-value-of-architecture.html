<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://www.swiss-miss.com/2012/02/penn-station.html">Tina Roth Eisenberg</a>. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/arts/design/a-proposal-for-penn-station-and-madison-square-garden.html?_r=3&hpw&pagewanted=all">Michael Kimmelman, The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>To pass through Grand Central Terminal, one of New York&acirc;&euro;&trade;s exalted public spaces, is an ennobling experience, a gift. To commute via the bowels of Penn Station, just a few blocks away, is a humiliation.</p>
<p>What is the value of architecture? It can be measured, culturally, humanely and historically, in the gulf between these two places.</blockquote></p>
