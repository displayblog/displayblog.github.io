<p><img class="size-full wp-image-4990 aligncenter" title="viewsonic_vt2230_22_inch_1080p_lcd_monitor" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/viewsonic_vt2230_22_inch_1080p_lcd_monitor.jpg" alt="viewsonic_vt2230_22_inch_1080p_lcd_monitor" width="500" height="409" /></p>
<p><a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/ViewSonic-Unveils-Full-HD-bw-14811481.html">Yahoo! Finance</a>: ViewSonic just announced the VT2230. The VT2230 is a 22" LCD monitor that sports a 16:9 aspect ratio just like LCD TVs. And it <em>is</em> a LCD TV, a 1080p LCD TV at that. The 16:9 trend will most likely accelerate since some major LCD manufacturers can churn out 16:9 LCD panels more efficiently than they can 16:10. The 22-incher from ViewSonic features a very good 1000:1 contrast ratio, a fairly quick response time of 5ms and a brightness of 300 cd/m2 that will require toning down. It's got TV tuners too so you can use it as a LCD TV.</p>
<p>The price? $349. Some might say it's a good price and some others might say it's a bit too much. As a comparison you can get a 32" LCD TV for $499. But that 32-incher will be limited to 1366x768 pixels. You can get a 26" LCD TV for $399. That too will be 1366 x 768. But most of us watch TV on our desks, so if you heart 1920 x 1080 and don't mind the 22" size when watching TV the $349 price seems to be right on.</p>
