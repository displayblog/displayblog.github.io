<blockquote><p>According to the latest research from our Handset Country Share Tracker (CST) service, Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s iPhone 5 overtook Samsung&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Galaxy S3 to become the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s best-selling smartphone model for the first time ever in the fourth quarter of 2012.</blockquote></p>
<p>According to Strategy Analytics, Apple shipped 27.4 million iPhone 5's in Q4'12 and 17.4 million iPhone 4S's. Both shipped more than the Samsung Galaxy S3's 15.4 million. Bear in mind these numbers are estimates and for shipments, not units sold to customers. There could be a lot of inventory floating around in the channel.</p>
