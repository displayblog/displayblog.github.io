<p><a href="http://www.beosound5.com/Default.aspx?redirect=true&amp;lang=en">B&amp;O</a>: When I first saw B&amp;O's BeoSound 5, I didn't know what it was. I still don't quite know what it is but generally speaking it is a A/V control unit. The BeoSound 5 has a 10.4-inch TFT LCD. The 10.4-inch LCD has a pixel format of 1024x768. As you can see B&amp;O opted for a 4:3 aspect ratio, which I think is interesting since a wide format LCD is associated with leading edge technology. But even without a wide LCD the BeoSound 5 looks quite futuristic and there is nothing else quite like it. Gallery after the jump.</p>
<p>The 500GB HDD will allow the user of this magnificent piece of art &amp; technology to store 28,000 or so songs or 1000 CDs in lossless quality. Quite a bit more, about 80,000 songs or 6000 CDs, if you're willing to give up some quality with MP3 at 196kbps. Of course, anyone who springs for the BeoSound 5 will want to go with lossless, I'm absolutely sure. And when you are playing music, similar to Apple's iTunes' Genius feature, the BeoSound 5 analyzes the music you're listening to and find more similar music. Head on over to  for a lot more information.</p>
