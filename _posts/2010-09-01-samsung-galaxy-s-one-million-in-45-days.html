<p>Samsung's Galaxy S Android smartphone hit one million units in just 45 days. It took 74 days for the Motorola Droid to get to 1.05 million. FYI, Apple's iPhone 4 sold 1.7 million units in three days. So far there are three Samsung Galaxy S models: Vibrant on T-Mobile and Captivate on AT&T and Epic 4G on Sprint, which was just made available on the 31st of August. Fascinate on Verizon is coming soon, on September 9th. That's about double the current potential market and will likely boost sales of the Super AMOLED-touting Hummingbird Android 2.2-upgradable smartphone from Samsung.</p>
