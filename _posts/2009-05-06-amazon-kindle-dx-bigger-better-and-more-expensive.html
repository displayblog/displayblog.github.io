  previous post about the Kindle DX</a>, the display is more than 50% larger at
  9.7\" (the Kindle 2 has a 6\" display) and has 16 levels of gray, just like the
  one in the Kindle 2. The DX has considerably more pixels than the Kindle 2 at 1200

  4GB</strong> The built-in PDF reader is something that current and would-be
  Kindle customers have wanted for a good long time and it's nice to see Amazon respond
  with the DX. The Kindle DX can store quite a bit more books than the Kindle 2: 3500
  versus 1500. The DX has 4GB of internal storage of which about 3.3GB is available
  to the user. The Kindle 2 had half of that. A feature comparison table and a video
  after the jump. "

<p><strong>Open Open</strong> I hope Amazon will tweak the way they handle blogs. Currently there are only a few popular blogs (few compared to all the great blogs that are available to a PC or smartphone user) that can be accessed on the Kindle. Amazon should simply open it up.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Phone Business Model?</strong> Clearly the Kindle DX is geared for those who need to read textbooks, magazines, newspapers, etc. that require a bit more information on each page. The DX will certainly meat the needs of those users better than the Kindle 2. But the price seems to be quite high. It would be a pleasant surprise if the <em>New York Times</em> or the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> subsidized the Kindle DX (or made it free!) with a 2-year subscription.</p>
