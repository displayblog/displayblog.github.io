<p>Dan Seifert, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/11/3/7148087/nexus-9-review">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Nexus 9&acirc;&euro;&trade;s display might have the same resolution and aspect ratio as the iPad, but it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not nearly as nice a screen. Colors aren&acirc;&euro;&trade;t as vibrant or appealing, the screen isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t laminated to the glass as on the iPad Air 2, and the backlight bleeds into the edges of the screen in unsightly ways. It's not a bad display by any means, but it feels appropriate for a $250 tablet, not something that starts at $400.</blockquote></p>
<p>The display on the iPad Air 2 is now laminated unto the cover glass. The competition has moved forward. (Though the new iPad mini 3 continues to have an air gap between the two.) Once you get exposed to something better &mdash; like content seemingly right at your fingertips on a tablet &mdash; that becomes the new thing to beat, and the Nexus 9 falls short. So does the iPad mini 3.</p>
<p>Light leakage should be a thing of the past and it is disappointing to see manufacturers continuing to struggle with this, especially on a halo product like the Nexus 9. Perhaps replacing double sided tape with an adhesive to attach the backlight unit, which is <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/11/03/lg-display-0-7mm-bezel-full-hd-lcd-smartphone-panel/">what LG Display did with its slim bezel 5.3-inch LCD</a>, would help.</p>
