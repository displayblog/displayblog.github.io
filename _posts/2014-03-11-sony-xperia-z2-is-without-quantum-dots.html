<blockquote><p>The widespread press reports that the Sony Xperia Z2 Triluminous LCD displays have Quantum Dots is incorrect. They don't.</blockquote></p>
<p>I thought Triluminos equaled quantum dots. I guess not; then what does Triluminos stand for?</p>
<p>I'm scratching my head as to how the Xperia Z2 without quantum dots is superior to the Xperia Z with quantum dots. Perhaps Sony is in the process of perfecting the use of quantum dots and hasn't gotten there yet. Similar to <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2013/07/11/nokia-lumia-1020/">Nokia's PureView</a>, Sony's sub-branding is confusing, to say the least.</p>

<p>Well, this is a bit of a surprise. According to Raymond Soneira, the Xperia Z2 doesn't use quantum dots and neither does the Xperia Z. I've scoured Sony sites for any mention of Triluminos or quantum dots in relation to the Xperia Z or Z2 and interestingly enough there are none. Where did this false idea originate? I'd be curious to find out.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.displaymate.com/Spectra_13.html">Soneira tested the light spectra of the Sony Xperia Z, HTC One, and Huawei Ascend D2</a>. All three exhibited very similar results. According to Soneira the Sony Xperia Z is using standard backlight units (BLUs) with blue LEDs coated with yellow phosphors. There is nothing special about the BLU in the Xperia Z or Z2.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.displaymate.com/Spectra_QD.html">The Kindle Fire HDX 7 uses quantum dots and the light spectral graph is quite different</a>: wavelengths surrounding each primary color is much more pointy (narrow) compared to BLUs without quantum dots.</p>
