<blockquote>
<p>To the rest of you, well, do <em>something</em> different. But, for jeepers sakes, do not keep fooling yourself that there is a tablet business or even much of a consumer PC business you have any chance of making real money in. If HP can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t, if Dell can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t, you are toast there.</p></p>
<p>To recap:</p></p>
<ul>
<li>Stop trying to make iPads. Make markets.</li><br />
</ul><br />
</blockquote></p>
