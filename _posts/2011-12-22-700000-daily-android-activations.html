<p>On December 11, 2011 <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Arubin/status/149329329237667844">Andy Rubin tweeted</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are now over 700,000 Android devices activated every day</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://www.asymco.com/2011/12/21/how-many-android-phones-have-been-activated/">Horace Dediu</a> crunched the numbers:</p>
<blockquote><p>So the best we can say right now is that there have been between 224 and 253 million Android devices activated to date. Why Google does not report this data regularly and consistently remains a mystery.</blockquote></p>
<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/12/22/activations">John Gruber</a>. <a href="http://www.interactioned.com/post/14622002217/700-000-daily-activations-isnt-good-news">Amit Runchal</a> on growth:</p>
<blockquote><p>The last time Rubin talked about Android activations was back in June, when he said that 500,000 devices were being activated daily, and that they were seeing week-to-week activation growth of 4.4%. There&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve been about 25 weeks between the two tweets. Some quick math reveals that week-to-week growth since June hasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t been anywhere close to the 4.4% Rubin was seeing. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s now closer to 1.4%.</blockquote></p>
<p>700,000 daily Android activations sound huge, but the reality is growth is slowing.</p>
