<p><a href="http://www.shopping.hp.com/webapp/shopping/store_access.do?template_type=series_detail&category=notebooks&series_name=ENVY173D_series">HP</a>: The HP Envy 17 3D sports a 17.3-inch 3D Ultra BrightView LCD and comes with active shutter 3D glasses. The LCD packs a 1920x1080 pixel format and graphics is powered by the 1GB ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5850. Price starts at US$1599. I'm not too wild about 3D especially the kind that requires the use of active shutter glasses, or any glasses for that matter. Why?
