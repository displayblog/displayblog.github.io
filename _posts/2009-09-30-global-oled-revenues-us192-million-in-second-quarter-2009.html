<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20090930PR202.html">DigiTimes</a>: Global OLED revenues were US$192 million in the second quarter of 2009 according to DisplaySearch. The record-setting US$192 million in revenues represent a 32% Q/Q and 22% Y/Y growth. Mobile phone main displays will continue to be the leading application for OLED with about $3 billion in 2016 and OLED TV, surprisingly, will be the second largest application with about $2 billion.</p>
<p>About 15 mobile phones that make use of OLED technology in the main display were released in 2009. Samsung, Nokia and Sony Ericsson were the leading companies to incorporate OLED technology into their mobile phones. All of these mobile phones made use of Active Matrix OLED (AMOLED) displays.</p>
<p>Samsung Mobile Display (SMD) was the top OLED supplier with a 38% unit shipment market share, followed by RiTdisplay. With just a couple more months left in 2009, we are expecting LG Electronics to incorporate a 15-inch AMOLED into a commercial OLED TV, making it the largest and besting Sony's XEL-1 OLED TV by 4 inches. The 15-inch AMOLED is manufactured by LG Display. Sony did announce a much larger 20-inch OLED TV back in 2008 but will not be commercialized until 2010 at the earliest. In mid-2010, high-end notebook PCs will begin making use of AMOLED displays.</p>
