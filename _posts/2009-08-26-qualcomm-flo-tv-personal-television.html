<p><strong>FLO TV?</strong> gdgt is reporting that Qualcomm is developing a "FLO TV Personal Television" that would work on the company's FLO TV network. The FLO TV network is available on a limited number of phones (Samsung, Motorola, LG) from AT&amp;T and Verizon in the US. FLO TV is based on terrestrial TV broadcast technology rather than via cellular data networks: it makes sense because it works, is fast, and therefore quality is much better than from a relatively pokey 3G connection. I've been to South Korea a couple of times in the last couple of years and have seen people watching TV on their mobile phones almost everywhere you go: walking on the streets, in the subway, cafes, etc. Of course the technology used in South Korea is a little different: the TV signals are brought to you by satellite.</p>
<p><strong>Bad Move</strong> Will a portable device the size of an <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=iphone&amp;sa=Search">iPhone</a> that works on the FLO TV network be successful? I doubt it. It's like <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=corning&amp;sa=Search">Corning</a> coming out with its own TV. Corning might the best LCD glass substrate maker but as a TV brand, I don't think it'll go very far. Or how about an Intel-branded notebook PC? Actually, that might work. But my point is: Qualcomm should stick to being a component supplier making cellular baseband chips and its <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=mirasol&amp;sa=Search">Mirasol</a> displays. Stay away from branded goods Qualcomm.</p>
<p><strong>The Right Move</strong> How about coming out with a reference chipset for a little adapter with an antenna for the iPhone and the iPod touch? I think that would work much better. Qualcomm can license its technology to Logitech for instance. Sports is really big in the US and most folks want to watch it <em>live</em>. Connect the FLO TV adapter on the iPhone, extend the antenna and you're in business! The adapter can be made for other devices like Microsoft's <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=zune+hd&amp;sa=Search">Zune HD</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Specs</strong> The concept drawing you see above was created by frog design, based in California. And here are some specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capacitive touch LCD, probably around 3.5 to 4.0 inches with a 480 x 320 or 800 x 480 resolution</li>
<li>4GB of memory</li>
<li>Built-in stereo speakers</li>
<li>Battery life: 300 hours standby, 5 hours of FLO TV, 15 hours of music</li><br />
</ul><br />
How long does the average baseball game last? Don't read, guess first.&Acirc;&nbsp;If you answered 2 hours and 54 minutes (in 2008) you'd be right. Almost 3 hours. Interestingly enough 3 hours is about the average length of college football and NFL games. Basketball is not as long with an average of around 2 1/2 hours. The 5-hour FLO TV time sounds like it'll be good enough for almost any sport event.</p>
