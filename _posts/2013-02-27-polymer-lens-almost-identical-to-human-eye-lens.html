<p>Ashley Rice, <a href="http://www.photonics.com/Article.aspx?AID=52873">Biophotonics</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The work, conducted by scientists at Case Western Reserve University, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, the US Naval Research Laboratory and PolymerPlus, provides a new material approach for fabricating synthetic polymer lenses. Using a multilayer-film coextrusion technique &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; a common method used for producing multilayer structures &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; the team stacked thousands of nanoscale layers, each with a slightly different refractive index. These layers were laminated and shaped into GRIN optics.</blockquote></p>
<p>GRIN stands for gradient refractive index and the human eye is a GRIN lens.</p>
