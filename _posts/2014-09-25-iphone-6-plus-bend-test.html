<p><a href="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Sr-lEnPwzAw">YouTube</a>: Using a four-point bend fixture one hundred pounds of force was applied to the center of the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, the Apple iPhone 6 Plus, and the iPhone 5s. How much did they bend? Here are the results:</p></p>
<ul>
<li>Samsung Galaxy Note 3: 4.5mm</li>
<li>Apple iPhone 6 Plus: 3.25mm</li>
<li>Apple iPhone 5s: 1.75mm</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Conclusion? The Galaxy Note 3 is made of plastic, so it bent more, but rebounded to its original shape. The iPhone 6 Plus, because it is made of aluminum, did not rebound and stayed bent. And is more prone to bending than the iPhone 5s.</p></p>
