<p><a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/news/23687">Samsung</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Boasting a versatile and eye catching 105&acirc;&euro;¬ù UHD display and a 21:9 aspect ratio, the Samsung Bendable UHD TV seamlessly goes from flat to curved, allowing users to decide how they want to watch TV &mdash; on a flat or curved panel &mdash; for an optimized viewing experience. This newest creation from Samsung features a Timeless Gallery design and a curvature of 4200R when curved. It also offers UHD Dimming and UHD Upscaling for more detailed picture optimization, reduction of light diffusion and enhanced contrast for incredible picture quality.</blockquote></p>
<p>If you have to ask how much it is...</p>
