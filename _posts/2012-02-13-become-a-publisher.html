<blockquote><p>I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m greatly dis&Acirc;&shy;ap&Acirc;&shy;pointed that the web allows medi&Acirc;&shy;oc&Acirc;&shy;rity to be so eas&Acirc;&shy;ily dis&Acirc;&shy;trib&Acirc;&shy;uted, but I should not over&Acirc;&shy;look the fact that it also offers this cheap, world&Acirc;&shy;wide dis&Acirc;&shy;tri&Acirc;&shy;b&Acirc;&shy;u&Acirc;&shy;tion to the thought&Acirc;&shy;ful and the tal&Acirc;&shy;ented. If you work hard to learn a craft and even harder to mas&Acirc;&shy;ter it, if you put great thought into what you say and who you want to say it to, then there&acirc;&euro;&trade;s no bet&Acirc;&shy;ter place to be pub&Acirc;&shy;lished than on a web&Acirc;&shy;site you your&Acirc;&shy;self own.</blockquote></p>
<p>I am not so disappointed nor do I care all that much about mediocrity online. When I bump into them I make sure I don't again. This doesn't happen all that much because most of my reading is through a RSS list filled with what I want to read. I get introduced to other sites by the folks I read so I'm quite safe from bumping into mediocrity on a regular basis, as long as I don't read my own stuff.</p>
<p>I might not be a normal writer. Actually I'm pretty sure I'm not. Writing alone is not my passion. When I look at DisplayBlog I want it to exude a certain something. The writing, the photos, the WordPress theme&mdash;all of these need to work together so it gives me a certain feeling. And absolutely integral to this is the content; content determines how DisplayBlog feels to me. That's why "written and produced by" at the end of this blog is more accurate than just "written by".</p>
<p>The only way to make this happen is to control the entire experience. I could start a magazine, but that's not financially realistic at all. The easiest and most affordable way is to own your own website and start writing and producing.</p>
