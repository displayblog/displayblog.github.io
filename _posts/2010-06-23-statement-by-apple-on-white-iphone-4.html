<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/06/23iphonestatement.html">Apple</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>White models of Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s new iPhone 4 have proven more challenging to manufacture than expected, and as a result they will not be available until the second half of July. The availability of the more popular iPhone 4 black models is not affected.</blockquote><br />
More challenging to manufacture probably means Apple is dealing with discoloration and cracking, similar to what happened with the white iPhone 3GS. At least when I do end up with my white iPhone 4 I can at least be assured it will continue to be white and without cracks forming.</p>
