<blockquote><p>Rocks like nothing else. The ultimate in entertainment with Beats Audio and Adobe Flash.</blockquote></p>
<p>The two biggest features that HP wants to get across about its TouchPad is Beats Audio and Adobe Flash. My guess is "rock" probably won't be the word used to describe Flash performance on the TouchPad. I do have a feeling audio coming out the TouchPad will probably sound better than the iPad though.</p>
