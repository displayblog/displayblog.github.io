<p><a href="http://www.trustedreviews.com/tvs/review/2010/10/28/Panasonic-Viera-TX-P42GT20/p1">Trusted Reviews</a> on the Panasonic Viera TX-P42GT20's 3D performance:</p>
<blockquote><p>And having donned one of the two pairs of active shutter glasses currently being given away free with the P42GT20, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a huge relief to find it performing every bit as well as Panasonic&acirc;&euro;&trade;s higher-grade 3D TVs when it comes to crosstalk noise. Compared with any rival 3D technology we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve seen, evidence of the dreaded double-ghosting phenomenon is extremely minimal - and even when it does crop up, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s seldom strident enough to be truly distracting. </blockquote></p>
<p>But brightness takes a hit and so do shadow and deep color details. The 2D-to-3D conversion is limited but "slightly less prone to depth errors."</p>
<p>On 2D performance:</p>
<blockquote><p>As a 2D TV, the P42GT20 is a mixed bag. The good news is that it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a stellar HD performer for its money, especially with 1080/24p Blu-ray feeds. Such images look mesmerizingly sharp, packed with natural contrast, and produced with an exceptionally deft colour touch. Regarding this latter point, colour tones are richer than usual for plasma technology, yet they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re also exquisitely natural. There seems marginally more striping in subtle colour blends than we saw with the VT20 models, but it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s seldom distracting.</blockquote></p>
<p>Standard definition didn't look all that great. But who buys a 3D 1080p TV to watch standard def? In my book Panasonic has the best plasma technology (thanks to Pioneer's KURO) and in many cases plasma outperforms LCD.
