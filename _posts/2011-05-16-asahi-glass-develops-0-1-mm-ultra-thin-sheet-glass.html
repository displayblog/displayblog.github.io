<p><a href="http://www.agc.com/english/news/2011/0516e.pdf">AGC</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>AGC announced today it has developed ultra-thin sheet glass manufactured using the float process, measuring just 0.1 mm, roughly the thinness of a sheet of paper. Made from alkali-free glass, which is used as a glass substrate for TFT-LCDs, AGC&acirc;&euro;&trade;s unprecedentedly thin sheet float glass will be used in next-generation displays, lighting, touchscreens and high-tech applications such as medical devices.</blockquote></p>
<p>Any gadget that sports a display would benefit from thinner glass and that includes mobile devices like smartphones, tablets, notebooks, but also non-mobile electronics like monitors and TVs. AGC's 0.1-mm ultra-thin sheet glass using the company's float process is extremely thin and would allow for even thinner and lighter LCDs. AGC will showcase its 0.1-mm sheet glass during SID 2011.</p>
