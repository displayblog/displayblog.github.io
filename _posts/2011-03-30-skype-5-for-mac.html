<p>Lukas Mathis at <a href="http://ignorethecode.net/blog/">ignore the code</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>At work, we use Skype to communicate. A lot of the people here use Windows computers. More than once, a Windows user walked by my Mac, saw my version of Skype, and said something to the effect of &Acirc;&laquo;wow, this looks so much better than the horrible mess we have on Windows!&Acirc;&raquo; It seems Skype has noticed that there is a discrepancy in quality between the two versions, and has decided to make the two versions more similar to each other. Unfortunately, instead of making the Windows version of Skype better, they&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve decided to fix the discrepancy by making the Mac version of Skype more like the Windows version.</blockquote></p>
<p>Skype neutered version 5 for Mac. I recommend you skip 5 and wait for the next one. I'm sticking with 2.8.</p>
