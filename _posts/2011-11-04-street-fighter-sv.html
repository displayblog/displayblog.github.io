<p>By Daniel Adel. Nothing new, but love the drawing. Hilarious! Here's an idea: <em>Street Fighter SV</em> as in Silicon Valley with awesome characters such as Eric Schmidt, Steve Wozniak, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Robert Noyce, Gordon Moore, Jerry Yang, Philip Hwang, James Clark, Scott McNealy, and of course Steve Jobs to name a few. Each will have a super power with Steve Jobs having the most powerful: the RDF.</p>
