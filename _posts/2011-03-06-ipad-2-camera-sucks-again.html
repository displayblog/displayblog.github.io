<p><a href="http://blog.nelso.com/2011/03/ipad-2-camera-worlds-first.html">Jack Deneut</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Although the details of the iPad 2's rear camera are still vague, Apple might have created the first digital camera in history that has <em>a higher-resolution LCD display than the camera's sensor</em>!</blockquote></p>
<p>If the iPad 2 crops digital stills taken from the camera on the back, like the iPod touch does, then the pixel format will end up being 960x720, which is less than the iPad's 1024x768 LCD.</p>
