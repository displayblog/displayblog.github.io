<p><a href="http://www.sanyo.com/news/2009/01/21-1en.html">Sanyo</a> &rarr; <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/01/21/sanyos-2009-hd-xacti-camcorder-lineup-brings-a-trio-of-worlds/">Engadget</a>: The Sanyo Xacti-line of camcorders just got a bump in specifications that should be very popular with anyone who is interested in shooting some nice <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1080p">1080p</a> footage. At 60fps. Most 1080p camcorders are limited to just 30fps and at that rate a lot of fast moving objects are not captured very well; just not very smooth. At 60fps even objects that move fairly quickly should be captured and viewed without a lot of jaggies.</p>
<p>The Xacti DMX-HD2000, shown above in Champagne Gold and Black, will be available next month. The video will be stored in AVC/H.264 format, which a lot of video processing programs will be able to easily handle. You really don't want to have to transcode one video file format to another when importing to a video processing program: quality deteriorates so much that HD becomes almost SD like.</p>
