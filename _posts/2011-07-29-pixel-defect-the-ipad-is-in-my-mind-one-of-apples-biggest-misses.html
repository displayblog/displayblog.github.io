<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/07/29/murph">John Gruber</a> reminded me of <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/27/editorial-engadget-on-the-ipad/">Darren Murph's opinion on the iPad</a> from February 2010.</p>
<p>There's more:</p>
<blockquote><p>[...] Jobs had the nerve to slam netbooks [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>And one more:</p>
<blockquote><p>As I mentioned, you'll say I'm just missing the point, but this thing does absolutely nothing for me in its current iteration.</blockquote></p>
