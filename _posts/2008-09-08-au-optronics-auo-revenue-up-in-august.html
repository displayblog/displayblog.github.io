<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=au-optronics">AU Optronics</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=auo">AUO</a>) announced August shipment results on September 8, 2008. The picture is mixed. Although shipments increase on a M/M basis, consolidated net sales is down almost 16% Y/Y.</p>
<ul>
<li>Consolidated Net Sales: Up 13.6% M/M, down 15.9% Y/Y to NT$37.1 billion</li>
<li>Large-area TFT LCD Shipments: Up 12.6% M/M to 7.3M units</li>
<li>Small/medium TFT LCD Shipments: Up 17.7% M/M to 20.8M units</li><br />
</ul><br />
It is important to note that consolidated net sales in August might be up compared to July, but coming out of Q2 there should be an increase. It has taken a bit longer this time to see an increase. Also AUO is reporting unit shipments unfortunately. Unit shipments really don't say much unless you have size broken out. With <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a> panels comprising a significant portion of output and the fact that it is many times bigger than a typical LCD geared for <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=notebook-pc">notebook PC</a>s or <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-monitor">LCD monitor</a>s, it is important to see exactly what type of LCD shipments increased. I wouldn't be surprised to see a large majority of that increase coming from smaller sized large-area LCD TV panels ranging from <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=26"">26"</a> to <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=32"">32"</a> and maybe even <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=37"">37"</a>. There has been a slowdown in IT spending as well so in terms of LCD monitor panel shipments, I would guess smaller sizes (&acirc;&permil;&curren;22")&Acirc;&nbsp;got a boost while larger sizes were stagnant. This assumption makes sense as <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/09/08/corning-lowers-q208-earnings-and-sales-outlook/">Corning has downward adjusted its outlook for Q3'08</a> due to LCD manufacturers cutting back on procuring LCD glass. You can still ship more in terms of units while cutting back on LCD glass procurement if you're manufacturing smaller sized LCDs.</p>
