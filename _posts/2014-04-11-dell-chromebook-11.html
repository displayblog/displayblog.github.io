<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/4/9/5597748/dell-chromebook-11-review">Dan Seifert, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Viewing angles and brightness are just okay, and can be improved, and I much prefer the Acer C720&acirc;&euro;&trade;s matte finish to Dell&acirc;&euro;&trade;s highly reflective gloss. My biggest complaint isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t so much with the screen&acirc;&euro;&trade;s performance &mdash; it works fine for browsing the web, watching video, and looking at photos &mdash; but with the 0.75-inch thick bezel surrounding the display. It really feels like Dell could have fit a 12-inch screen in this without sacrificing anything in terms of size.</blockquote></p>
<p>Dell's focus was hitting a certain price point (sub-US$300) and great battery life (10 hours). With a larger, better display Dell wouldn't have hit either.</p>
