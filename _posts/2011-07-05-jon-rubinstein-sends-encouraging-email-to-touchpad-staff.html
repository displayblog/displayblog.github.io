<p>Jon Rubinstein <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.precentral.net/jon-rubenstein-sends-message-hp-staff-addresses-touchpad-reviews">PreCentral.net</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In that spirit, Richard Kerris, head of worldwide developer relations for webOS, reminded me yesterday of the first reviews for a product introduced a little over ten years ago:</p>
<p> "...overall the software is sluggish"<br />
"...there are no quality apps to use, so it won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t last"<br />
"...it's just not making sense...."</p>
<p>It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s hard to believe these statements described MacOS X - a platform that would go on to change the landscape of Silicon Valley in ways that no one could have imagined.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/07/05/rubinstein-memo">John Gruber</a>: "I think that analogy works."</p>
<p>But where it does not work: Jon Rubinstein &ne; Steve Jobs.</p>
