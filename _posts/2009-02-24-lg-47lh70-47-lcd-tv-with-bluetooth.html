<p><a href="http://www.gadgetreview.com/2009/02/lg-announces-new-scarlet-tv-lh70-us-to-be-cheated-out-of-releasemaybe.html">Gadget Review</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/02/23/lg-unveils-42-and-47-inch-bluetooth-lh70-hdtvs-in-korea/">Engadget</a>, <a href="http://www.akihabaranews.com/en/news_details.php?id=17617">Akihabara News</a>: LG announced its LH70 Series LCD TV. The LH70 series come in two sizes: 42" (42LH70) and 47" (47LH70). I'll focus on the larger 47LH70 here that feature a 47" IPS (In-Plane Switching) TFT LCD with a 1920 x 1080 pixel format. The dynamic contrast ratio of 100,000:1 is good but falls short of others. In this case since I am not sure the 47LH70 sports a LED backlight the dynamic contrast ratio figure is moot. Only pay attention to this figure when you see both LED backlight and local dimming together. The 120Hz frequency should reduce motion blur quite a bit for those of you who like to watch sports. Bluetooth and a video after the jump.</p>
<p>The interesting feature about the LH70 Series is that it sports Bluetooth. Why Bluetooth on a TV? Maybe you'd like to use your stereo Bluetooth headset so you don't wake up the Mrs. Or maybe you'd like to display your 8MP pictures from your OMNIAHD and beam them via Bluetooth. Or maybe you'd like to connect your Bluetooth keyboard and mouse (and PC) to use the 47LH70 as a massive monitor. I'm sure folks will find creative ways to make use of the Bluetooth connectivity.</p>
<p>And here's a video press release by LG:</p>
