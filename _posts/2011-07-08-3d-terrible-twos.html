<p>Jeffrey Katzenberg, Animation Chief at Dreamworks, <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jeffrey-katzenberg-why-hollywood-is-196616">The Hollywood Reporter</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>3-D is right smack in the middle of its terrible twos. We have disappointed our audience multiple times now, and because of that I think there is genuine distrust &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; whereas a year and a half ago, there was genuine excitement, enthusiasm and reward for the first group of 3-D films that actually delivered a quality experience.</blockquote></p>
<p>The next feature film I'll be watching in 3D will be <em>Avatar 2</em>. The first, and only, was <em>Avatar</em>.</p>
