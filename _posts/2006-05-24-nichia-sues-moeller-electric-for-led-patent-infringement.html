<p>Nichia, a Japan-based maker of LED lighting solutions, sued Moeller Electric, the Japanese subsidiary of Moeller GmbH in Germany for infringing Nichia's patents regarding blue LEDs (Type No. M22-LED-B). The patents that are being infringed are: No. 2770717, No. 3356034 and No. 3656456. Nichia seeks damages for past infringements and to cease infrining activities.</p>
<p>With technical development increasingly costly and complex, someone is bound to step on someone else's toes, whether diliberate or accidental. LED as a source of display backlighting continues to be hailed as the future of lighting for displays that go into LCD monitors, NBPCs and LCD TVs.</p>
