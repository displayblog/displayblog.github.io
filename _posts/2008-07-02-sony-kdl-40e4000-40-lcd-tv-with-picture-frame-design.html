<p><a href="http://www.sony.co.uk/view/ShowProduct.action?product=KDL-40E4000&productsku=KDL40E4000U&site=odw_en_GB&pageType=TechnicalSpecs&imageType=Main&category=TVP+32-40+Sony+BRAVIA+TV">Sony UK</a>: The Sony KDL-40E4000 is a 40-inch LCD TV that looks more like a picture frame. You can imagine the 40" LCD TV as a huge digital photo frame. And that's exactly how Sony would like you to think when the TV is on standby. The picture frame design looks very nice. To make sure the picture looks as good as possible, the KDL-40E4000 LCD TV incorporates some of the latest advancements including a x.v.Color gamut that improves color fidelity as well as good viewing angles (178/178). The x.v.Color is enabled by the use of a wide color gamut CCFL (WCG-CCFL). The video processing isn't he very best, but the BRAVIA Engine 2 is an improvement over the previous versions and should be able to provide very good results when using the TV as a TV.</p>
