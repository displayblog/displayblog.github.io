<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=samsung">Samsung</a>'s Sukyong Hong, Senior Manager of Overseas Sales and Marketing, stated that the notebook division needs to sell 11 million <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=notebook-pc">notebook PC</a>s in 2011 for it to be sustainable. Currently, Samsung has a worldwide share in notebook PCs of just 1.7% and to be sustainable it will need to about triple that market share in three years. Sounds dubious.</p>
<p>But Samsung has a plan. And this is big! Samsung will be entering the US and European notebook PC market! Samsung has a <em>huge</em> advantage over most other notebook PC manufacturers. Samsung itself makes 80% of the components including: HDDs, SSDs, RAM, LCDs, driver ICs, etc. and this vertical integration should allow the company to substantially bring down the cost. I've seen a number of Samsung-branded notebook PCs in South Korea and they seem to be look as good as if not better than most ho-hum units coming out from other brands.</p>
