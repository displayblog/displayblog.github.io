<p>Samsung Corning will start to develop larger flat fluorescent lamp (FFL) based backlights. Currently, the company's FFL backlights can be used for <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=32"">32"</a> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a>s. In the very near future, Samsung Corning will produce larger FFL backlights for use in <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=40"">40"</a> and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=46"">46"</a> LCD TVs. The sizes correspond very well to <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=s-lcd">S-LCD</a>'s optimized sizes of 40" and 46" LCD TV panels. S-LCD supplies panels to both Samsung and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sony">Sony</a> for large-size LCD TVs.</p>

<p>Current capacity is at one million annual units but the company is planning to boost that to two and is currently planning construction. By acquiring IPs from <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=osram">Osram</a> Opto Semiconductors, Samsung Corning is developing mercury-free FFL backlights, a must if the company wishes to work with TV brands that will be entering the European TV markets.</p>

<p>FFL backlights offer longer lifetimes and better light uniformity compared to the typically round cold cathode fluorescent lamps (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=ccfl">CCFL</a>s). Another benefit is that the number of FFL tubes required to luminate an LCD is much less than CCFLs. For instance, a 32" LCD TV will typically require 16 CCFLs while a FFL-based backlight system will require just one FFL. Even at larger sizes, only one FFL will be needed according to Samsung Corning.</p>
