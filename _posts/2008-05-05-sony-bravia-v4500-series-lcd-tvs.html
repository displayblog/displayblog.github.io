<p>Sony's BRAVIA V4500 series LCD TVs come in three sizes: 26", 32", 37". All have a 720p-capable pixel format, not the Full HD 1920 x 1080 that we expect most LCD TVs to have. You want to hook up your PlayStation 3 to watch some Blu-ray titles? Don't do it with these; it won't look as good compared to a 1080p LCD with 120Hz and a LED backlight. The BRAVIA ENGINE 2 might help to compensate for the lack of pure pixels. Picture quality should be decent with a dynamic contrast ratio of 33,000:1 for the 26" and 32" models. The 37" model features a slightly lower dynamic contrast ratio of 22,000:1, but still very high.</p>
<p>The design might be interesting to some, but I think the LINE design concept is going to end up being annoying. Why? Well, there's a horizontal line on the bottom, but there's also a horizontal gap. Right smack in the middle of that gap you can see the neck of the stand. Do you want to see that every time? I don't. With the Picture Frame Mode turned on, the V4500 LCD TVs will act as a huge digital photo frame.</p>

<p>Note: Was there a mistake in the company's press release about its BRAVIA V4500 series LCD TVs? The pixel format that is being quoted is 1360 x 768. Unfortunately, that's not 16:9. I believe the correct pixel format would be 1366 x 768 or 1365 x 768 (as some PDP TVs have this format).</p>
