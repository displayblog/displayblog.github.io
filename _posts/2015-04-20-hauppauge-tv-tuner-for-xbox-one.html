<p><a href="http://news.xbox.com/2015/04/xbox-one-over-the-air-tuner">Xbox Wire</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&acirc;&euro;&trade;re excited to announce a partnership with Hauppauge, 23-year veterans in the over-the-air TV space, to deliver one of the most asked for Live TV features on <a href="http://feedback.xbox.com/">Xbox Feedback</a> to our fans in the U.S. and Canada &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; an over-the-air TV tuner. Support for over-the-air TV on Xbox One means access to broadcast networks available in your area, like CBS, FOX, NBC, and PBS, with no subscription cost.</blockquote></p>
<p>Microsoft should integrate an over-the-air TV tuner directly into the Xbox, as well as into its smartphones.</p>
