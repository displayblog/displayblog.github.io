<p>20.1" LCD monitors are a dime a dozen and you can get one for about $350. So it's nothing new. But there is something new about the PW201 from Asus. It has a webcam. Second, it has a webcam with 1.3MP. I believe it was Sony that started the whole notion of adding webcams to NBPCs with their TR series. Apple started doing it with their iMac AIOs (all-in-ones). Now Asus has started it with monitors. </p>
<p>The ASUS PW201 uses a VA LCD panel, which gets you a wide viewing angle of 176/176. The black case is glossy (some might like it) but has a rather thick bezel. The stand is very nice looking: the tilting and height adjustment mechanism looks to be fairly sturdy. However, <a href="http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/other/display/20inch-4_4.html">Xbit Labs</a> reports that the stand "is not firm enough and the monitor is wobbling a little even when you touch it but lightly."</p>
