<p><a href="http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF05a/321957-321957-64295-3841267-3955550-4332667.html">HP</a> &rarr; <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/15/hp-mini-1103-released-for-business-people-on-a-budget/">Engadget</a>: The HP Mini 1103 is a 10.1-inch business-oriented netbook sporting a 1024x600 pixel format and a LED backlight. Most likely the LCD is of the TN variety so won't be all that great viewing at angles. Graphics is powered by Intel's GMA 3150.</p>
<p>The Mini 1103 weighs 2.78 pounds and is powered by Intel's 1.66GHz N455 or 1.83GHz N475. Maximum RAM is limited to just 2GB. The Mini 1103 is probably a competent performer but that slight elongation of the neck (that portion that connects the chassis to the display) makes it look weird.</p>
