<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://dcurt.is/the-ios-address-book-jennifer-van-grove-finally-sets-the-record-straight">Dustin Curtis</a>. <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/02/14/iphone-address-book/">Jennifer Van Grove, VentureBeat</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Foursquare, Foodspotting, Yelp, and Gowalla are among a smattering of iOS applications that have been sending the actual names, email addresses and/or phone numbers from your device&acirc;&euro;&trade;s internal address book to their servers, VentureBeat has learned. Several do so without first asking permission, and Instagram and Foursquare only added permissions prompts after the Path flare-up.</blockquote></p>
<p>That sucks.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/15/2800338/ios-explicit-permission-address-book-update">The Verge</a>. Apple:</p>
<blockquote><p>We're working to make this even better for our customers, and as we have done with location services, any app wishing to access contact data will require explicit user approval in a future software release.</blockquote></p>
<p>I thought top notch iOS developers did everything they possibly could to make the total user experience of using their apps exceptionally good. That requires a deep understanding of what we want. And what we want is not for our privacy to be violated. It takes a response from Apple to make this clear? I am disappointed.</p>
