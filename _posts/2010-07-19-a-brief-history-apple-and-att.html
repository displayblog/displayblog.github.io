<p>The Apple and AT&amp;T marriage has been a series of ups and downs. Wired's&Acirc;&nbsp;Fred Vogelstein looks into it and provides some&Acirc;&nbsp;fascinating tidbits, like this one regarding the original iPhone:</p>

What&acirc;&euro;&trade;s more, Apple had chosen to source the radio from Infineon, whose hardware was used widely in Europe but rarely in the US, where cell towers are placed farther apart and reception is therefore less forgiving.</blockquote><br />
