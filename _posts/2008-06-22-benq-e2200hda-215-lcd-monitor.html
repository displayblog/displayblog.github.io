<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=benq">BenQ</a>'s E2200HDA has a name that does not reflect its true size of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=21.5"">21.5"</a>. So, it isn't a 22". And it isn't a 22" in other ways: the pixel format is <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a>, a format that we see more in <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a>s than in <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-monitor">monitors</a>. We will see more monitors with 1920 x 1080 pixel formats as LCD manufacturers move toward that direction due to better glass efficiencies that can lead to lower cost of manufacturing. The E2200HDA is a handsome monitor and the slanted bar underneath the display where the power button is seems to be a good design choice since you're pushing downward more so than backwards and possibly swiveling the monitor.</p>
<p>The line between LCD monitors and LCD TVs have been getting blurry over the years and I think the shift to 16:9 aspect ratios for LCD monitors will make it even more difficult to decipher. BenQ's E2200HDA will allow for black-bar-free viewing of 16:9 HD content but will leave with 120 less vertical pixels for business applications. The pixel format of 1920 x 1080 will also make it very difficult to have two pages on the monitor at once and be able to view the contents. Guess you can't have everything, but the trend toward 1920 x 1080 is inevitable.</p>
