<p>Jun Hong Optronics is a Taiwan-based joint venture between Wah Hong Industrial and Gunze, a Japan-based touch panel manufacturer. JHO is planning to begin production of Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) in February or March 2010 with an initial capacity of 50,000-60,000 m2 per month. In November 2009, Wah Hong began shipping optical films to LG Electronics geared for 32-, 37-, 42-inch LCD TV panels that use either CCFL or LED as the lightsource for the backlight.
