<p><a href="http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20080902005214&amp;newsLang=en">BusinessWire</a> <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/09/02/nec-debuts-premium-22-inch-ea221wm-lcd-monitor/">Engadget</a>: The NEC EA221WM is touted as a premium 22" LCD monitor by the company. There are two things I can think of that makes the EA221WM a premium 22" LCD monitor. First is the ability to adjust the height of the EA221WM and swivel, tilt, and pivot. Second, and more important in my opinion, is the non-TN LCD panel that is used. I am not sure if it is IPS or VA but the 176 viewing angle suggests that one or the other is used. Of course there are TN panels that can get a very wide viewing angle by using advanced optical films and cutting some corners in terms of viewing angle measurements. Up to this point, if you bought a 22" LCD monitor you were buying it for price and not necessarily for front screen performance. There was the sole exception with <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2007/09/20/lenovo-thinkvision-l220x-22-wuxga-lcd-monitor/">Lenovo's ThinkVision L220x</a> that uses a PVA LCD panel. But the L220x LCD monitor also sported a pixel format of 1920x1200, which is quite a bit more than what the EA221WM has. But, the EA221WM is definitely premium due to the use of an IPS or VA panel.</p>
<p>In addition to a very good performing LCD panel in regards to viewing angle, the EA221WM has an ECO Mode that reduces power consumption. The EA221WM is also Energy Star compliant and meats EPEAT Gold requirements. The 4-port USB hub in addition to the cable management cover should help make the desk environment a bit more tidy as well.</p>
