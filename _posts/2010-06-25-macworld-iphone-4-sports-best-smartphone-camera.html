<p><a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/152314/2010/06/iphonecameratests.html">MacWorld</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>... the highest scoring of all the smartphone cameras that we tested, was none other than the iPhone 4. Next in the rankings was the Droid X, followed by the EVO 4G, the Samsung Galaxy, and way at the bottom, the iPhone 3GS.</blockquote><br />
It is interesting to note that both the Droid X and the EVO 4G sports a camera with 8 megapixels, three more than Apple's iPhone 4 with just five. More megapixels doesn't mean better quality photographs. The 1/3.2-inch CMOS image sensor in the iPhone 4 is special with its backside illumination, which shifts the circuitry from the front to the back allowing the photons to reach the photoreceptors with less blockage. And more light means better photos. The iPhone 4 also takes good pictures in low light for a smartphone. The 3.85-mm lens on the iPhone 4 feature a fixed aperture of f/2.8 with shutter speed and ISO automatically adjusted. According to MacWorld it seems the ISO ranges from 80 to 1000 with exposure as fast as 1/10,000 of a second to 1/15th a second.</p>
<p>Also of note is the video quality rankings:</p>
<blockquote><p>While its image quality was impressive, it was the iPhone 4's video capabilities that really stole the show in our lab tests. Of the eight devices we rated for video, only the Flip Video M2120 scored higher.</blockquote><br />
The iPhone 4 even bested Sony's DSC-WX1 in video quality.</p>
