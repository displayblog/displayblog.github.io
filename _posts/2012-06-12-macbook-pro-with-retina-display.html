<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs/">Apple</a>: 15.4-inch LED-backlit IPS LCD with a 2880x1800 pixel format good for a resolution of 220 ppi. <em>Man</em>.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.06.12:</em> <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/5998/macbook-pro-retina-display-analysis">Anand Lai Shimpi, AnandTech</a>: LCD black levels on the retina display MacBook Pro was 0.38 nits, which is still bested by the Razer Blade. White levels came in around the middle of the pack at 339 nits. With so many pixels packed into the 15.4-inch LCD it is surprising the white levels on the retina display didn't come closer to the bottom. Contrast at 892:1 came in ahead of the Razer Blade (806:1) but lower than the ASUS Zenbook Prime UX21A (939:1). The 220-ppi 15.4-inch IPS retina LCD is an impressive accomplishment especially in light of up to a 7-hour battery life.</p>

<blockquote><p>I have a review unit from Apple, and after just 15 minutes or so trying it out, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s damn impressive. Much like with the iPhone and iPad, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not so much that the retina display looks good as that, after you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve used it for even just a few minutes, non-retina display MacBooks look bad. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not just pixel size, either &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; color, brightness, viewing angles &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; everything about it is amazing. Best display I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve ever seen, period.</blockquote></p>
<p>Probably meant to say the best <em>notebook</em> display.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.06.19:</em> <em>via</em> <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2012/06/19/ifixit-macbook-pros-amazing-retina-display-is-made-by-lg-philips">Seth Weintraub, 9to5Mac</a>. So who makes this fantastic display? "LG Philips" says Miro at iFixit. LG Philips? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Display">LG.Philips LCD was renamed LG Display</a> with the exit of Philips from the joint venture in late 2008. And then there's 9to5Mac reader johnnielse who harshly points out it is not LG Philips and declares the right name to be LG.Display. Note: The correct name is LG Display, without the dot.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.06.23:</em> <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6023/the-nextgen-macbook-pro-with-retina-display-review/4">Anand Lai Shimpi, AnandTech</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the combination of these two elements, the removal of the cover glass and the insanely high pixel density that makes everything from text to UI elements just look painted on the new Retina Display. And the effect is gorgeous. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve never seen a prettier panel and it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s actually ruined me for pretty much all other displays, notebook and desktop.</blockquote></p>
<p>I'm so glad Apple did away with the cover glass. It made the entire display assembly thicker, heavier, and made it possible for dust to get trapped in between it and the LCD. There was reflectance, too.</p>
<p>I can safely say the next iPhone and iPad will have a similar display design where the top glass is customized with an integrated bezel the shape of the device. It will have the same impact on the iPhone and iPad: thinner, lighter, less reflectance, and more brilliant.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.07.23:</em> <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/07/windows-and-os-x-boot-camp-running-redmond-at-retina-resolution/">Chris Foresman, Ars Technica</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Though Windows 7 doesn't quite have the same experience when it comes to resolution and scaling control as OS X does&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it can be a bit of a chore to get it just the way you like it&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it's still quite useable on the Retina MacBook Pro's 15" 2880 x 1800 pixel screen. I recommend running Windows at full resolution with the 150 percent scaling setting&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that seemed to give the best overall usability. </blockquote></p>
<p>Windows 7 on the retina MacBook Pro, better than on any other hardware, so far.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.07.31:</em> <a href="http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/news_archive/26.htm#macbook_retina_panel">TFT Central</a>: The panel is from LG Display with model number LP154WT1 (SJ) (A1) GD. Folks still think its LG Philips. LG.Philips LCD changed its name to LG Display, a very long time ago.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.08.25:</em> <a href="http://gravitationalpull.net/wp/?p=2003">Aaron Pressman</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The program in the upper left corner is Microsoft Word. Look at the jaggies in that 12 point type. Ugly. Now look over to the top right. That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s own Pages program with the same words in the same font also at 12 points. Yummy. Likewise, in mid-screen is Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s TextEdit program. Smooth as a baby&acirc;&euro;&trade;s bottom. And in the lower foreground, Adobe&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Dreamweaver with text that looks like, well, like ass as Gruber might say.</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple continues marching forward with the latest and greatest; the retina display on the MacBook Pro is a good example. Most Apple advancements make some things better right now, like the transition from PowerPC to Intel, and the retina display makes some things <em>a lot</em> better right now, but it also makes some things a lot worse too.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.08.26:</em> <a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/08/26/retina-mbp-review">Marco Arment</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I thought, having previously used Retina screens on my iPhone and iPad, that I had a pretty good idea of how good a Retina screen would be on a laptop.</p>
<p>I was wrong. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s far nicer than I expected. And after five days of only seeing Retina screens, the 30&acirc;&euro;¬ù HP ZR30w on my desk really looks like garbage. Huge, spacious garbage.</blockquote></p>
<p>Try not to go to the Apple Store and spoil your eyes by looking into a 15.4-inch retina MacBook Pro because if want to pump 2880x1800 pixels unto a larger external display there is currently no way.</p>
