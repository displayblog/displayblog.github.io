<p>Acer's AL2032 has a 20" wide display with 1680 x 1050 resolution. Acer's CrystalBrite technology enhances sharpness, colors and tones. The monitor has a black acrylic finish distinguishing itself from most other monitors by looking very elegant. Response times are 16ms, has S-Video and Composite inputs, and a set of speakers.</p>

<p>The design also won awards from the 2005 International Forum Design, the Design Zentrum Nordrhein Wastfalen and Germany's Red Dot.</p>
<p>The panel is supplied by LG.Philips LCD and uses Super IPS that provides 178 degree viewing angles. 16.7 million colors are supported; DVI and VGA connections are available. Brightness is 300 cd/m2 with a contrast ratio of 600:1. Prices are around 370 pounds or US$692. A bit on the expensive side, but if you want bit more bling than a Dell box (20" wide at ~$450), you need to shell out.</p>
