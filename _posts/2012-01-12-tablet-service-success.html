<blockquote><p>Amazon may have taken some critical heat over its latest Kindle, but the product reveals an interesting approach by the company&acirc;&euro;&trade;s CEO. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Some of the companies that have made tablets have not been successful because they made tablets,&acirc;&euro; Jeff Bezos said. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;They didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t make services.&acirc;&euro; That statement is an acknowledgement of the growing value that can be derived from service-based business models, rather than from product innovation alone.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Amazon Kindle Fire is more of a service innovation, and in need of extensive tablet innovation.</p>
