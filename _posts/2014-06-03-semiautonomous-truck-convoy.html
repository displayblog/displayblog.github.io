<p><a href="http://www.popsci.com/article/cars/robot-truck-convoy-tested-nevada">Kelsey D. Atherton, Popular Science</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/527476/10-4-good-computer-automated-system-lets-trucks-convoy-as-one/">technology</a>, developed by Peloton Tech, uses radar and a wireless link so that the following trucks travel at the same speed, braking simultaneously for safety, and doing so on an automated system that doesn't have the delays of human reaction time.</blockquote></p>
<p>More safe.</p>
<blockquote><p>Peloton <a href="http://www.peloton-tech.com/about/">says</a> the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;technology saves more than 7% [of fuel] at 65mph &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; 10% for the rear truck and 4.5% for the lead truck,&acirc;&euro; which is tremendous because &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Long-haul fleets spend 40% of operating expenses on fuel, accounting collectively for over 10% of U.S. oil use and related carbon emissions.&acirc;&euro; These savings come primarily from reduced aerodynamic drag.</blockquote></p>
<p>More efficient.</p>
