<p>WHO <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/05/31/who.cell.phones/index.html">CNN</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Radiation from cell phones can possibly cause cancer, according to the World Health Organization. The agency now lists mobile phone use in the same "carcinogenic hazard" category as lead, engine exhaust and chloroform.</blockquote></p>
<p>Dr. Keith Black, chairman of neurology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles:</p>
<blockquote><p>So in addition to leading to a development of cancer and tumors, there could be a whole host of other effects like cognitive memory function, since the memory temporal lobes are where we hold our cell phones.</blockquote></p>
<p>Cell phone radiation could have a larger impact on children. Dr. Black:</p>
<blockquote><p>Children's skulls and scalps are thinner. So the radiation can penetrate deeper into the brain of children and young adults. Their cells are at a dividing faster rate, so the impact of radiation can be much larger.</blockquote></p>
<p>And here's what Apple thinks about its iPhone 4, as found on the user manual:</p>
<blockquote><p>When using iPhone near your body for voice calls or for wireless data transmission over a cellular network, keep iPhone at least 15 millimeters (5/8 inch) away from the body.</blockquote></p>
<p>Of course, there will be others who disagree with the WHO's assessment of whether or not cell phones cause cancer. Here is University of Maryland physics professor Bob Park <em>via</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/05/31/who-cell-phones-cancer">Daring Fireball</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>All cancers are caused by mutant strands of DNA. Electromagnetic radiation can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t create mutant strands of DNA unless the frequency is at or higher than the blue limit of the visible spectrum the near-ultraviolet. The frequency of cell phone radiation is about 1 million times too low.</blockquote></p>
<p>I'm no scientist and I don't hold a PhD in anything, but my question to Dr. Park is: maybe electromagnetic radiation cannot <em>create</em> mutant strands of DNA, but can it somehow aid in the creation?</p>
<p>I think it's safe to say that we need to be cautious about using mobile phones, including smartphones like the iPhone 4. I'm a parent of three and I'd rather be on the safe side and be careful not to expose them to cellular radiation.</p>
