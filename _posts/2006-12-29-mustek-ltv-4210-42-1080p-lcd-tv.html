<p>Mustek's LTV-4210 is a 42" 1080p LCD TV that will be showcased during CES 2007. The 42" LCD will have a 176-degree viewing angle, 6.5ms response time, 1200:1 contrast ratio (dynamic, actual will be less, quite a bit less), and 550 cd/m2 of brightness. In addition, the LTV-4210 will sport HDMI, an integrated ATSC tuner, and two 10W speakers.</p>

<p>Mustek is even less known than Vizio. With Vizio's 42" 1080p LCD TV offering to come in at <a href="http://displayblog.wordpress.com/2006/12/16/vizio-47-1080p-lcd-tv-less-than-2000-in-february-2007/">less than $2000</a>, Mustek's price should be even lower. Otherwise, I'd go with the Vizio brand if the two were my only choices.</p>
