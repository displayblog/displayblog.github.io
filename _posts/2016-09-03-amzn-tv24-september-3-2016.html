<p><a href="http://displayblog.com/2016/08/25/amzn-tv24/">Click here for a brief description about DISPLAYBLOG&rsquo;s AMZN.TV24 market research</a>. AMZN.TV24 doesn't track specific models -- just the ones that show up on the front search result page -- but there are some models that show up more consistently than others. And then there are some prices that go up and more importantly down on some days.</p>
<p>For instance, there were three TV models where the prices went up and three that went down. The three that had their prices drop today were:</p>
<ul>
<li>LG 55LH5750: down $10</li>
<li>Samsung UN55KU6300: down $39.68</li>
<li>Samsung UN60KS800: down $100</li><br />
</ul><br />
Bear in mind these prices are not the lowest I've seen since I've been reporting AMZN.TV24, but I'm expecting TV prices -- all of them including all brands, all sizes, 4K &amp; 1080p -- to begin a downward trend culminating between Black Friday and&nbsp;Cyber Monday in November.</p>
