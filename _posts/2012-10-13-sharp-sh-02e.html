<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/11/3487390/sharp-igzo-sh02e-docomo-hands-on">Jeff Blagdon, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The most impressive part of the demo was an installation emphasizing the IGZO-based display&acirc;&euro;&trade;s power efficiency &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; it used only a quarter of the power of its competitor when idle, and about 25 percent less during active use.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Sharp AQUOS Phone Zeta SH-02E sports a 4.9-inch 1280x720 IGZO-based LCD. The resolution is 299.7 ppi. IGZO outperforms a-Si, but IGZO is not better than LTPS when it comes to high-resolution smartphone-sized LCDs: LTPS has much higher electron mobility. IGZO will end up being more affordable to manufacture than LTPS in the long run, but for now if performance matters LTPS is the better choice.</p>
<p>Where IGZO should theoretically shine is in larger displays. A good example would be a future 13-inch 2560x1600 LCD. At that size and at that resolution it becomes impossibly expensive to manufacture with LTPS, and performance would be lacking with a-Si; IGZO would provide a perfect balance between cost and performance. It's also good to know IGZO-based LCDs are power efficient.</p>
