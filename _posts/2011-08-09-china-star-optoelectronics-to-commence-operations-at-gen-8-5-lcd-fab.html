<blockquote><p>China Star Optoelectronics Technology (CSOT), a subsidiary of TCL, plans to kick off operations at its 8.5G TFT LCD flat panel production line in Shenzhen, China on August 8 with mass production of flat panels slated for October, according to sources familiar with CSOT's roadmap.</blockquote></p>
<p>Input capacity is expected to reach 20,000 glass substrates per month by the end of 2011. CSOT brings its Gen 8.5 LCD fab online when other display manufacturers are reducing capacity utilization due to weak demand for LCD goods.</p>
