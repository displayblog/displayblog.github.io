<p>BOE is one of two China-based LCD suppliers. The other being a hybrid Chinese-Japanese SVA-NEC. BOE canceled its HK$2.5 billion (US$300 million) share issuance in Hong Kong. The cancelation was the result of a delay in its internal share holding reform. In a time when leaders in the industry are pouring billions to build G8 fabs, BOE must continue to get bigger or develop unique technology and stay small. The Japanese, aside from Sharp and IPS Alpha, have stayed small with highly developed technology. TMDisplay is a good example that recently developed a 11.1" wide NBPC panel using a LED backlight and is being used in Sony's ultra-portable TX series NBPCs.</p>
