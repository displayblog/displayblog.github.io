<blockquote><p>The Motorola Citrus ranked the least toxic phone followed by the iPhone 4 S and the LG Remarq. The new iPhone 5 ranked 5th, versus its primary competitor, Samsung Galaxy S III, which ranked 9th. The most toxic phone tested was the iPhone 2G.</blockquote></p>
<p>The iPhone 4S, LG Remarq, and Samsung Captivate are tied for second place. The original iPhone is dead last among the 36 phones researched, but you've got to give to Apple for most improved: #36 &rarr; #2.</p>
