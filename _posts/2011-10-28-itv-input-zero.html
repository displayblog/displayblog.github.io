<p><a href="http://www.splatf.com/2011/10/apple-tv-box/">Dan Frommer, SplatF</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Right now, the Apple TV box is aiming for &acirc;&euro;&oelig;input 2&acirc;&euro;&sup3; on your TV [...]</p>
<p>But long-term, Apple probably wants its TV platform to be &acirc;&euro;&oelig;input zero.&acirc;&euro;¬ù That is, the first thing you see when you turn your TV on. The only thing you need to watch video, make FaceTime calls, download apps, play games, and maybe even use Siri to order a pizza. The only remote control you need. The heart and soul and brain of your living room.</blockquote></p>
