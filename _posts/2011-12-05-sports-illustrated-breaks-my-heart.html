<blockquote><p>Who breaks my heart the most? Sports Illustrated. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve been an SI subscriber since I discovered the glorious world of sports. I absolutely adore the writing in SI. I absolutely abhor the iPad experience that my favorite print magazine offers. There is no worse magazine experience on the iPad presently.</blockquote></p>
