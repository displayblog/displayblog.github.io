<p>Of course there's an iPhone shortage. Not because there is so much international demand, but because there is so much international demand relative to supply. And supply of the 8GB and 16GB first generation iPhone is dwindling. This is nothing new. Apple almost always dries up the channel for a given product when a new, better, advanced version of it is about to be born. There are many others who have voiced the same conclusion and I will join that chorus: Apple has already developed the second generation iPhone and is probably testing it right now and getting ready to volume manufacture it so that a few hundred thousand units (at least) are available when June 29, 2008, the iPhone's first anniversary, comes around.</p>

Ah, my beloved iPhone will be second tier technology in just over two months. Thanks to AT&amp;T I will gladly make use of my first generation iPhone until June 29, 2009. If all goes as planned, that's when I expect the third generation iPhone to become available.<br />

Engadget is reporting that Walt Mossberg mentions, quite confidently, that "the iPhone will be 3G in 60 days." I guess we're on the same page when it comes to the 3G iPhone.</p>
