By embedding time-sequential technologies right into the panel, LG Display was able to improve the brightness of the panel, about twice that of other 3D displays. Time-sequential just means that the left and right eyes see different images resulting in a 3D effect. 3D viewing is possible with polarized glasses which are generally pretty affordable. The company will be showcasing this 23-inch 1080p 3D LCD at the Society of Information Display (SID) 2009 show that will be held in San Antonio, Texas.</p>
