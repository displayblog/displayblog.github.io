<p>Steve Jobs during the introduction of the new MacBook Air:</p>
<blockquote><p>We asked ourselves, "What would happen if a MacBook and an iPad hooked up?" Well, this is the result. &acirc;&euro;&brvbar; We think it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the future of notebooks.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/11-inch-macbook-air-is-ultra-portable-and-surprisingly-powerful-review/65776">Cult of Mac</a> on the 11.6-inch MacBook Air:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is the future of notebooks. The 11-inch Air blends extreme portability with surprising power. Starting at $999, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s priced to sell.</blockquote></p>
<p>The only thing that concerns me is the absence of a backlit keyboard. Right this minute, I'm using that backlight feature on my MacBook Pro to bang out this post in a dark room.</p>
<p>The lack of an optical drive might be a concern but when you're buying music online, streaming movies, downloading software there really is little need. The one thing you need the optical drive for is OS re-installations and that will soon be taken care of with Apple moving to USB flash drives. I might even consider <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/search/data+doubler">Other World Computing's Data Doubler</a> that replaces the optical drive on select MacBooks with a SSD.</p>
