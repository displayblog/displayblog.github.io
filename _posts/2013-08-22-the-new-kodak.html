<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-08-20/kodak-bankruptcy-reorganization-plan-approved-by-new-york.html">Bloomberg</a>: Kodak will become a commercial printing company.</p>
<blockquote><p>Under the reorganization plan, Kodak will also focus on a new technology -- touch-screen sensor components for smartphones and computer tablets -- and continue producing film for the movie industry.</blockquote></p>
<p>Commercial printing, touch screen sensor components, and film. Kodak still doesn't know what it wants to be. A touch screen sensor component supplier doesn't have much of a future: Touch screen sensors have already been integrated into high-end smartphone displays and will eventually be integrated into all smartphone and tablet displays.</p>
