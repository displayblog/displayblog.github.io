<p>According to <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=projectiondesign">projectiondesign</a>, its F10 AS3D is the only portable high resolution active <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=3d">3D</a> stereoscopic projector on the market. projectiondesign is planning to showcase the F10 AS3D at the upcoming InfoComm conference that will be held in Las Vegas. The F10 AS3D is based on a single-chip <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dlp">DLP</a> design and is geared for visualization and simulation environments.</p>
<p>The University of Munich in Germany has already installed eight of projectiondesign's F20 sx+ DLP projectors that have built-in Infitec filters to generate a 3D stereoscopic computer-aided virtual environment (CAVE) visualization system, which is called Four Space 110 and was designed by 3Dims. projectiondesign's F20 sx+ 3D projector uses passive stereo projection technology. Six of projectiondesign's F30 sx+ DLP projectors are used at Global Immersion by INTECH Science Centre & Planetarium for an immersive theatre design, located in Winchester, UK.</p>
