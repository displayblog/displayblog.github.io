<p>Moving is one of the most stressful things that can happen to you. The others are death, getting married, and having children. Sampo moved it&#39;s PDP production plant from Kunshan, Taiwan to Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China. Suzhou is located in the middle of the Yangtze Delta and on the shores of Taihu Lake, bordering Shanghai in the east and has a population of 5.7 million. Why? Probably because everything in China is cheaper. Sampo stated that only high-end PDP TVs will be manufactured in its Taiwan plant while 75% of 100,000 less-high-end PDP TVs will be manufactured by the new plant in China.
