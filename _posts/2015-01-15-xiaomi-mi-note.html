<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/15/7550903/xiaomi-mi-note-announced-specs-price">The Verge</a>: The Xiaomi Mi Note is a 5.7-inch smartphone, and comes with two display options: 1920x1080 (386 ppi) and 2560x1440 (515 ppi) for the Pro version. The 1920x1080 LCD features a 95% NTSC color gamut and is supplied by Sharp and JDI. The 2560x1440 display specs were not disclosed at this time.</p>
<p>During the Mi Note introduction, Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun mocked the iPhone 6&acirc;&euro;&trade;s camera bump. The iPhone 6 Plus is 7.1-mm thick, while the Mi Note is thinner at 6.95 mm. The Mi Note has a 13 megapixel f/2.0 camera with optical image stabilization; the iPhone 6 Plus a 8 megapixel f/2.2 camera with OIS. Despite the Mi Note being thinner than the iPhone 6 Plus the camera is flush with the body. (There are no cartoonish-looking antenna bands either.)</p>

<blockquote><p>I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d wager a handsome sum the iPhone 6 Plus takes better photos than the Mi Note, but it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s rare for Apple to leave an opening like this for design mockery.</blockquote></p>
<p>The iPhone 6 Plus (and iPhone 6) received a <a href="http://www.dxomark.com/Phones">DXOMark Mobile Score</a> of 82, which is number one among smartphones at the time of this writing. The #3 Samsung S5, #4 Sony Xperia Z3, and #5 Z2 all scored 79. I doubt the Xiaomi Mi Note will score higher than these, but I am open to surprises. I am curious as to what the mechanical and optical differences are between the two camera subsystems that make one protrude out and the other not.</p>
