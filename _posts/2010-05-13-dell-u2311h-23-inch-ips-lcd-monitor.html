Dell's U2311H is a simply-designed (I like) 23-inch LCD monitor sporting an IPS TFT LCD and a very affordable price of US$300. The exact IPS panel is probably LG Display's e-IPS (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/01/28/lg-display-lpl-23-e-ips-1080p-lcd-monitor-panel/">LG Display (LPL) 23" e-IPS 1080p LCD Monitor Panel</a></em>). The design looks to be business oriented but the aspect ratio is 16:9, quite consumer, with a pixel format of 1920x1080. I would think business users would prefer a 16:10 with 1920x1200. Other specs include: DisplayPort, DVI, VGA, 1000:1 CR, 300 cd/m2 of brightness, 8ms GTG response time and an unfortunate CCFL backlight.</p>
<p>A "3-Year Premium Panel Advanced Exchange Service" is included. If the U2311H has problems that cannot be resolved over the phone Dell will ship out a replacement unit the very next business day. All you need to do is use the same box to ship out the defective one. Now that's nice. The U2311H as well as the slightly smaller 21.5-inch U2211H has been added to the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/databases/ips-lcd-monitors/">IPS LCD Monitor database</a>.
