<p><strong>3D TV GOING LIVE:</strong> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=lg&amp;sa=Search#1348">LG</a> and SkyLife (Korea Digital Satellite Broadcasting) will work together to set <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=3d&amp;sa=Search#1363">3D</a> broadcasting standards for content, devices, and technologies. 3D TV trials will start in South Korea and then permeate to North Amercia and Europe in 2010 and a year later to South America, Central America and the rest of Asia. The two will also develop technologies that "don't cause eye strain or dizziness". That's good.</p>
<p><strong>3D TV SETS IN 2010:</strong> LG plans to introduce 3D TVs in 2010 with sizes ranging from 42 inches to 72 inches. Currently the company has a 47-inch LCD 3D TV on the market, the 47LH503D. You'll still need to put on shutter glasses to experience 3D from these TVs.</p>
<p><strong>PS:</strong> What's up with this guy's hair? My recommendation for LG and SkyLife: get younger more hip guys and gals to put on 3D glasses and do the demonstrations. That would sell a lot better in my opinion.</p>
