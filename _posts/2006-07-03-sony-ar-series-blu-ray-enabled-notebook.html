<p>I'm not 100% sure, but Sony's AR series is the first Blu-ray enabled notebook PC where you can play, record and re-write Blu-ray discs. The AR series has a nice piano black exterior with a very nice and simple design. The notebook PC has a 17" screen with Sony's XBRITE Hi-Color technology and has 1920 x 1200 resolution, powered by nVidia's GeForce Go 7600GT with 256MB of video RAM. The VGN-AR170 BTO is the premium model. All four models weigh 8.4lbs but the VGN-AR170 BTO goes up to Intel's Core Duo T2600 CPU and comes with 2GB installed. Hard drive's maximum capacity is 320GB (160GB x 2) on the VGN-AR170 BTO, which is pretty darn big. The unfortunate thing is that with the 160GB x 2 configuration, the speed is limited 4200RPM. This is a very elegant and powerful system. Currently there is pricing for only the VGN-AR190G with a 17" 1920 x 1200 display, Blu-Ray and a 2.0GHz Intel Core Duo CPU for $3500. Hefty price but still very desireable!</p>
