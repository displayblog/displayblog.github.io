<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/26/arrows-z-fujitsu-toshiba-outs-waterproof-android-phone-with-wimax-13mp-camera/">TechCrunch</a>: 1280x720 on a smartphone is where it's going, except for Apple. I just wrote about the <a href="/2011/09/26/samsung-galaxy-s-ii-hd-lte-4-65-inch-1280x720-hd-super-amoled/">Samsung Galaxy S II HD LTE that sports a 4.65-inch 1280x720 HD Super AMOLED</a>. And about a week ago there was news regarding the <a href="/2011/09/19/lg-lu6200-optimus-lte-4-5-inch-1280x720-ah-ips-lcd/">4.5-inch 1280x720 AH-IPS LCD sporting LG LU6200 Optimus LTE</a>. And now, we have the Fujitsu-Toshiba Mobile ARROWS Z ISW11F.</p>
<p>The Android 2.3.5 smartphone packs a 4.3-inch LCD with a 1280x720 pixel format. That's a 0.2 inches smaller than the LU6200 Optimus LTE but with the same number of pixels. I believe the ARROWS Z ISW11F takes the title of resolution king with a ppi of 341.5. In 2012 most high-end smartphones will most likely sport a pixel format of 1280x720. I don't think Apple will be there though.</p>
<p>1280x720 has an aspect ratio of 16:9 and is great for 16:9 720p HD video playback, but we do a lot more than watch movies on our smartphones. That's why Apple made the iPhone displays 3:2. Of course that also made it not so great for watching 16:9 videos. If only displays could morph into the best aspect ratio for what we are doing at the time...</p>
<p>The choice is clear. If 16:9 720p HD video playback is a really big thing for you then the three 1280x720 Android smartphones must be at the top of your list. If you already have a huge collection of multimedia and apps on your iPhone, then stick to it because the 3.5-inch 960x640 Retina Display is absolutely superb for almost anything you'd want to do on it. It's just that the new crop of high-end Android smartphones with a 1280x720 pixel format is perfect for 720p HD video.</p>
<p>Other noteworthy specifications include a waterproof body, 13 megapixel Exmor R CMOS image sensor, and 1080p HD video recording. Japanese smartphone manufacturers seem to have figured out how to waterproof the body without adding bulk. I hope this becomes standard practice because I still vividly remember pulling out my iPhone 3G from my pool-dunked jeans and hoping it was going to continue working. It did, for another five minutes. If only the iPhone had been waterproof.</p>
<p>The Sony sourced Exmor R for mobile CMOS image sensor is <em>thirteen</em> megapixels. Backside illumination (BSI) technology to improve the light gathering capabilities of those thirteen million pixels is used, but I think both Sony and Fujitsu-Toshiba Mobile went a little overboard. 1080p HD video recording, on the other hand, is just right.</p>
<p>The WIMAX global phone is offered by KDDI in Japan and is expected to be available in November.</p>
