<p>Toshiba's 42WL566 is a 42" LCD TV with Full HD resolution at 1920 x 1080. The folks at <a href="http://www.t3.co.uk/reviews/entertainment/hd_ready_tv/toshiba_42wlt66_hd_ready_lcd_tv">T3</a> pointed out the plasticky bezel but also noted that the picture quality was fantastic. At less than $2000, the 42WL566 is a bargain reported the article. <a href="http://www.trustedreviews.com/article.aspx?art=3148">Trustred Reviews</a> gave the 42WLT66 a 10 out of 10 rating for value. The contrast ratio is 800:1, brightness at 550 cd/m2, and has two HDMI ports, two SCARTs, and a PC input among other non-HD input methods.</p>

<p>I must say the box itself is nothing to call home about. The brand Toshiba is also not on the top list of brands I would want to bring home and proudly display in my living for everyone to look at. However, the price is competitive for a 1080p unit.</p>
