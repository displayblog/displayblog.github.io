<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/gao-to-fcc-its-time-to-solve-the-mystery-of-cell-phone-radiation/">Casey Johnston, Ars Technica</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The US Government Accountability Office has recommended that the FCC formally reassess its limits for radio frequency exposure from cell phones, according to a report publicly released on Tuesday. The limits created in 1996 were based on data that is now two decades old, and while hundreds of studies have been conducted on the subject since, not many are useful or conclusive.</blockquote></p>
<p>In recent months I have been actively shifting away from using my iPhone as a voice communications device and toward using Skype on my MacBook. I'm on the unlimited U.S. plan for US$2.99 per month. The connection and voice quality is almost always better than on my iPhone. Where I live AT&T offers poor quality for quite a bit of money, so once my contract expires next month I will be moving away to T-Mobile and specifically to its prepaid $100 SIM card, which is good for 1000 minutes and valid for one year. That's exactly what I need. But let's get back to why I'm limiting my brain's exposure to cellular radiation.</p>
<p>Every time I stick my iPhone to my ear I don't feel completely safe. It could be purely psychological, but I'd rather be safe than sorry. And even if cellular radiation ends up being proved to cause cancer there's no way anyone will be able to recuperate all the medical expenses associated with treating brain cancer later on. AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon, etc. are powerful companies with deep enough pockets to literally bury you with legal tricks. By the time the government gets involved most of us would already be dead or be close to dying because of our brain cancers. So yes, I'd rather be safe than sorry. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/07/business/media/07adco.html">Not very long ago there were strange times when doctors recommended certain brands of cigarettes, on national television</a>. I think we are living in strange times today: There is little concern for radiation emitted from mobile phones, WiFi, microwaves, power lines, satellite broadcasting, x-ray, CT scans, MRIs, etc. The 'experts' have all claimed these technologies are safe. That's a bit too convenient, isn't it?</p>
<p>I wonder when I'll be able to port my mobile number to Skype...</p>
