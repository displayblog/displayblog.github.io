<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8386" title="Aluratek_Libre_eBook_Reader_PRO_eBook_Reader" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Aluratek_Libre_eBook_Reader_PRO_eBook_Reader.jpg" alt="Aluratek_Libre_eBook_Reader_PRO_eBook_Reader" width="211" height="300" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20091208005416&amp;newsLang=en">Business Wire</a>: The Libre eBook Reader PRO from Aluratek is different than 99% of the ebook readers out there: it eschews the typical E Ink display and instead makes use of a 5-inch reflective LCD. No, it doesn't last as long as ones with an E Ink display but it does last 24 hours. I've thought about how long we really need for ebook readers to last. We really don't need to have it last many days since it would be unusual to be without access to a power socket for days. You could be on a safari but then what are you doing looking at your ebook reader. An electronic gadget should last an entire day and that should be plenty. Most of us living in the modern world would have access to a power socket in about 24 hours. So the 'limited' battery power on the Libre eBook Reader PRO is of no concern to me. The standby time is 2 weeks.</p>
<p>The Libre is compatible with ePUB, TXT, FB2, MOBI, RTF, PRC and PDF formats. A SD slot gives you external storage (up to 32GB) and a 2GB card filled with 100 free ebooks comes with the purchase. You can display BMP, JPG, GIF and animated GIF images and listen to MP3 files too.&Acirc;&nbsp;I really like the price at just US$179 but the design can be improved somewhat.</p>
