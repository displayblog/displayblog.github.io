<p><a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3025274/move-over-product-design-ux-is-the-future">Rick Wise writing for Co.Design</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t ask customers what they need, but observe how they behave and what makes them happy or sad. Then assess what people <em>could</em> do. Think about what they will notice, and what they will remember.</blockquote></p>
<p>To do this right a company needs to hire people who have expertise in psychology, anthropology, game theory, etc. and have them work together with those who have traditional skills such as industrial design, UI design, software engineering, etc. The person who manages this hodgepodge of people will need to be somewhat of a renaissance man who knows something about almost everything.</p>
