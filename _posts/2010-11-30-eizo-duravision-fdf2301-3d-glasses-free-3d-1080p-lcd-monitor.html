<p><a href="http://av.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/20101130_410445.html">AV Watch</a> &rarr; <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/12/01/eizos-duravision-lcd-does-glasses-free-3d-at-1080p-is-totally/">Engadget</a>: The Eizo DuraVision FDF2301-3D is thick, but packed behind the 23-inch 1920x1080 LCD is stuff that allows for glasses-free 3D viewing. From what I can glean from the Japanese text at AV Watch, the 3D monitor makes use of a "Directional Backlight" as well as these other technologies: Side by Side, Anaglyph, Frame Sequential. I would have thought with how thick this is that Eizo might have used two 23-inch LCD panels for real 3D.</p>
