<blockquote><p>E Ink Holdings (EIH) and Chunghwa Picture Tubes (CPT) on July 19 formed a strategic alliance with the e-paper supplier investing NT$1.5 billion (US$51.9 million) to acquire 3-year zero-interest unsecured convertible bonds to be issued by the TFT LCD maker. The alliance is expected to see CPT use its 6G plant to produce e-paper backplanes and FFS (fringe field switching) panels for EIH.</blockquote></p>
<p>E Ink will hold about 6.6% of CPT, who will produce 7- and 10.1-inch FFS LCDs for E Ink. FFS is similar to IPS in terms of performance: wide viewing angles, little shift in contrast and colors.</p>
