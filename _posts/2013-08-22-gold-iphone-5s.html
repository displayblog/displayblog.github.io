<p><a href="http://appadvice.com/appnn/2013/08/exclusive-high-resolution-photos-of-the-rumored-gold-iphone-5s-back-housing">AppAdvice</a>: Photos of a gold&mdash;more like champagne&mdash;iPhone 5S have surfaced and they look like the real deal. The iPhone has been monochromatic since 2007 and if the gold/champagne version turns out to be real I can think of only one reason: China might soon be Apple's largest market for the iPhone, and China, as well as many other Asian countries, loves gold. But China loves red, too. And that's the problem: catering. What if it turns out China loves red more than gold? Will the iPhone 6 come in <em>four</em> colors? Supply chain management becomes more complicated and more expensive, but more important than manufacturing efficiency, the iPhone should be designed for universal appeal.</p>
