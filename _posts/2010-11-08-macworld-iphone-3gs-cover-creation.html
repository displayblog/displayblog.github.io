<p>This video has been on YouTube for a while but I just bumped into it and thought I'd share it with you. That's a lot of work that goes into making the cover of MacWorld: getting the perfect photo and beautifying the iPhone 3GS. I was somewhat surprised when the front screen was pasted onto the iPhone's display.</p>
