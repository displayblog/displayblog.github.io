<blockquote><p>A check of Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s full-time iPhone engineering job listings shows 10 postings for full-time jobs at the Cupertino, California-based company that seek knowledge of CDMA.</p>
<p>Apple has been looking for people familiar with CDMA technology for some time, with one listing posted in September 2008.</blockquote></p>
<p>Great investigative work. Is Apple developing an iPhone that works on CDMA networks? Absolutely. The question is when Apple will announce it. A lot of folks are pointing to January 2011.</p>
