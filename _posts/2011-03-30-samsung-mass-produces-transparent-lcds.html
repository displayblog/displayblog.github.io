<p><a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110330006990/en/Samsung-Electronics-World&acirc;&euro;&trade;s-Mass-Production-Transparent-LCD">BusinessWire</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. announced today that it began mass production of a 22-inch transparent LCD panel in March this year.</p>
<p>The panels come in two types, the black-and-white type and the color type, and they have a contrast ratio of 500:1 with WSXGA+ (1680*1050) resolution.</p>
<p>Compared with the conventional LCD panels that use back light unit (BLU) and have 5% transparency, Samsung&acirc;&euro;&trade;s transparent LCD panel boasts the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s best transparency rate of over 20% for the black-and-white type and over 15% for the color type.</blockquote></p>
<p>One important step toward transparent LCDs for smartphones to really get some augmented reality action going.</p>
