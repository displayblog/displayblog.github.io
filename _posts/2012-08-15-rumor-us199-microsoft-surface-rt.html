<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/08/14/microsoft-surface-199/">Tim Stevens, Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to an inside source, a session was held at Microsoft's recent TechReady15 conference in which all the launch details were laid out. If things go according to the plan detailed then, the Surface for Windows RT tablet will be launching October 26th -- no surprise there -- at a compelling price of $199.</blockquote></p>
<p>If the rumor is true, Microsoft will completely obliterate the competition. Even Apple will not come out of this unscathed. If the rumor is false, any price higher than $199 will initially be met with disappointment.</p>
