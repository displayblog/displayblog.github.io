<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-8879 aligncenter" title="Samsung_Atom_N450_Netbook_1024x768_N150_N210_N220_NB30" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Samsung_Atom_N450_Netbook_1024x768_N150_N210_N220_NB30.jpg" alt="Samsung_Atom_N450_Netbook_1024x768_N150_N210_N220_NB30" width="453" height="329" /></p></p>
<p>Samsung's new Atom N450-based netbooks include the N150, N210, N220 and NB30. Each sport a 10.1-inch TFT LCD with a 1024 x 768 pixel format. If this is real, and it does seem that way based on the press release, the 10.1-inch LCD sports a 4:3 aspect ratio instead of the wide formats that we have been seeing on almost all new netbooks and notebooks. The main reason why Samsung might have opted for a relatively tall LCD compared to those with 16:10 or 16:9 aspect ratios is probably due to the extremely limited vertical screen real estate with typical netbook 10.1-inch screens that are limited to 600 lines. The N210 and N220 lasts 12 hours, the NB30 11 hours, and the N150 8.5 hours. The NB30 features a HDD protection sensor, a water-tight seal that protects it from 50cc of spilled water (not quite water tight in my opinion). All have scratch-resistant casing.
