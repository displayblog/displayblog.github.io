<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/05/07/pioneer-kuro-and-friends-hands-on/">Engadget</a>: The folks over at Engadget was able to take a shot of the comparison that Pioneer built to showcase the second generation KURO plasma display panel (PDP). The thing that really pops out to me is how terrible the LCD panels are. Granted, LCD panel black levels are actually worse when viewing from an angle. But even if the LCD panels were viewed dead on, I don't think it would have even gotten close to the black levels of the Samsung or Panasonic PDPs. The original KURO PDP is certainly black, but even in this picture you can see that the second generation KURO is even blacker. I'm sure there will be a third generation KURO, but with just the second generation KURO there will be a lot of people that go "Wow!"</p>
