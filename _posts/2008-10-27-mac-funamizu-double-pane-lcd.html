<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=mac-funamizu">Mac Funamizu</a>'s designs are simple and elegant. His double pane LCD is very nice: simple &amp; elegant. By using a transparent LCD along on top of a regular one different images are juxtaposed to create depth in the images. I'm not sure if the purpose was to create a 3D display. Just like with paper, you can add layers of paper to create a, well, layered effect. I think that's what Funamizu-san was going for and it looks great.</p>
