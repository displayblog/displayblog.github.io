<blockquote><p>Songdo is in South Korea, so naturally it has super fast Internet access. It's also a test bed for Cisco's high-resolution videoconferencing products: About 10,000 Cisco units are expected to be installed in Songdo residences over the next several years, allowing people to videoconference in HD and interact with video-based tutoring and concierge services. In the city's Chadwick School, kids can do telepresence meetings with their counterparts at Chadwick's main campus in California.</blockquote></p>
<p>Songdo is a city built on top reclaimed land near Incheon International Airport (ICN). <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/sim-city-inside-south-koreas-35-billion-plan-to-build-a-city-from-scratch.php">Read all about this US$35 billion bet</a>.</p>
