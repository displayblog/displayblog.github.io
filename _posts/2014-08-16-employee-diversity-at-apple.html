<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/diversity/">Apple</a>: 55% are white, overall. 64% are white, in leadership. 70% are male. Compare this to Cupertino, where Apple is headquartered and is the city's largest employer with 15,000 employees (source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino,_California">Wikipedia</a>): 29% white, 63% Asian.</p>
