<p>Toshiba Mobile Display (TMD), a joint venture between Toshiba and Panasonic, invested JPY16 billion in 2008 to build an OLED manufacturing line in the Ishikawa Prefecture. Masahiro Kume, TMD spokesperson, <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTKZ00656520101001">Reuters</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The plan (for mass-production) is currently frozen. We'll review the production plan again from scratch.</blockquote></p>
<p>There is only one OLED game in town and that's Samsung Mobile Display (SMD). And it's a special type of OLED using Nouvoyance's PenTile Matrix sub-pixel technology.</p>
