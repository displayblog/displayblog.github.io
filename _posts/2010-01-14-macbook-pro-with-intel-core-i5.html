<p>Most likely a Core i5-powered MacBook Pro will soon be introduced. An Intel Retail Edge Program contest flier "accidentally" showed the prize as a MacBook Pro powered by an Intel Core i5. Intel corrected it and now the prize is an Envy 15. Source: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/14/macbook-pro-with-intel-core-i5-processor-revealed-via-intel-prom/">Engadget</a></p>
