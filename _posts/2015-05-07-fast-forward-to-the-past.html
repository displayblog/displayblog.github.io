<p><a href="http://thehipperelement.com/post/118359687821/evolution">Joel Marsh, an Experience Architect, visualized the history of the mobile phone by focusing on its size and shape, titled Evolution</a>. Marsh's simple and elegant graphic prompted me to think about the mobile phone and its impact on our lives.</p>
<p>Everywhere I look people are super glued to their phones. Seldom do we break ourselves away from their invisible pull, but when we do they never stop demanding our attention. A pleasant ding. An innocent chirp. They tug endessly.</p>
<p>Eventually we crack, our eyes turn from our friends, and our necks deign to the phone's irresistible promise. Of gaining knowledge, of being connected, of filling our emptiness.</p>
<p>I want to fast forward to the past. To when we didn't have mobile phones. To when we crafted love letters by hand. To when we savored them. To when we tasted a truer happiness.</p>
