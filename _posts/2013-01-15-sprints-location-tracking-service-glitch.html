<p>Amar Toor, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/15/3878156/wayne-dobson-mistaken-cellphone-thief-las-vegas">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[...] an apparent glitch in Sprint's location-tracking services [...] has been directing owners of missing phones (as well as police) to Dobson's home in North Las Vegas. As a result, he's had people knocking on his door at all hours of the night, asking for cellphones he doesn't have.</blockquote></p>
<p>That sucks for Wayne Dobson, but what's suckier is Sprint not having already fixed this problem. Here's Sprint's response: "We will research the issue thoroughly and try to get to the bottom of what is going on and if it has anything to do with our company." Sprint, simply state you <em>will</em> fix the problem. Grow some balls. This is not just a technical problem; Sprint's negligence is having a significant negative impact on a man's life.</p>
