<p>Carephone Warehouse has the Samsung Galaxy Tab on pre-order for &Acirc;&pound;529.99. Even less at &Acirc;&pound;499 with a Talk Mobile &Acirc;&pound;10 per month. FYI, the iPad starts at &Acirc;&pound;429. I wonder why the 7-inch Samsung Galaxy Tab can't be significantly less expensive than the 9.7-inch iPad.

<p>PS: The video on Trusted Reviews is incorrect when it states that the Galaxy Tab sports an OLED display; it is a LCD. The pixel format is not 800x480; it is 1024x600.</p>
