<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/06/12/hyundais-w220s-lcd-google-earth-now-in-3d/">Engadget</a>: The Hyundai W220S TriDef 3D is a 22" LCD monitor that can show you contents in 2D as well as 3D. You'll have to wear a nifty-looking set of 3D glasses, arguably one of the most stylish ones ever made! Of course, I already wear glasses, so this would pose a problem. For those who have a good eyes, the combination of a 3D monitor and cool glasses has never been an option, until today, in Japan.</p>

<p>Specifications for the W220S is pretty good with a standard 1680 x 1050 pixel format for the 22" size. Contrast ratio is better than average at 1000:1 while brightness is at 300 cd/m2. The 5ms response time is on the fast side but what gets me is the poor viewing angle of 160/150; nothing unusual since Hyundai's W220S uses a TN LCD that usually exhibit not-so-great viewing angle performance. Hyundai will bundle Google Earth 3D, a couple of 3D games and a TriDef media player to playback 3D video content. I wonder if there is any 3D video content to play back.</p>
