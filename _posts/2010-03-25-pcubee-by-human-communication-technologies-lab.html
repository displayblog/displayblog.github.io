<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pCubee_Human_Communication_Technologies_Lab_3D_Cube.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-10065 aligncenter" style="margin-left: 10px; " title="pCubee_Human_Communication_Technologies_Lab_3D_Cube" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pCubee_Human_Communication_Technologies_Lab_3D_Cube.jpg" alt="" width="361" height="291" /></a>The Human Communication Technologies Lab at the University of British Columbia has designed pCubee, a five-LCD cube that displays 3D content you can play with. Most 3D displays are based on stereoscopy where alternating frames trick the brain into perceiving depth and most solutions require a geeky pair of 3D glasses. pCubee uses motion parallax instead. Motion parallax is "the apparent change in position of an object, depending on the distance from which you view it." According to Sidney Fells, who leads the Lab</p>
<blockquote><p>Our brains are wired to perceive motion parallax and interpret it as 3D. It's one of the reasons why even if you have just one eye, you can do reasonably well with depth in the real world.</blockquote><br />
Fells and his team plan to commercialize pCubee to be used as a gaming platform, a CAD/CAM platform or be used in museums. Fells:</p>
<blockquote><p>We imagine this as something that would be on everybody's coffee table.</blockquote><br />
