<p><a href="http://www.viewsoniceurope.com/uk/products/desktop-monitors/lcd/x-series/vx2258wm.htm">ViewSonice Europe</a>: The ViewSonic VX2258wm is a 22-inch LCD monitor with infrared optical imaging technology. That means you can reach out and touch it. Just don't try to multitouch the monitor for too long; that'll get tiring real soon. There's even a phrase for that: Gorilla Arm Syndrome.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs during the introduction of the new MacBook Air:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve done tons of user testing on this and it turns out it doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t work. Touch surfaces don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t want to be vertical. It gives great demo, but after a short period of time you start to fatigue, and after an extended period of time, your arm wants to fall off.</blockquote></p>
<p>The specs: 1920x1080, 5ms response time, High Bandwidth Digital Protection (HBDP) Blu-ray device support, &Acirc;&pound;189.</p>
