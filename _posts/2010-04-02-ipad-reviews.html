<blockquote><p>Has any other company ever demonstrated a restlessness to stray from the safe and proven, and actually invent things?</blockquote><br />
Well, yes, many companies have invented far greater things than the iPad. I don't consider Apple a company that invents new things; Apple is a company that perfects what already exists and creates something that seems to not have existed before. Take a look at the iPhone: all of the components were there including multitouch technology, high-end mobile LCD manufacture, baseband chips, enclosure manufacturing, etc. What Apple did with the iPhone was it combined existing components and perfected the phone. Apple is doing that again with tablets in slab form.</p>
<p><a href="http://ptech.allthingsd.com/20100331/apple-ipad-review/">Walt Mossberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I believe this beautiful new touch-screen device from Apple has the potential to change portable computing profoundly, and to challenge the primacy of the laptop.</blockquote><br />
Unfortunately Mossberg doesn't quite get the iPad. The iPad is something right in between the smartphone and the full-blown notebook. The iPad is not going to challenge the notebook's primacy. I'll tell you why... actually, Steve Jobs has already told us why. The iPad does a few things really well and these things don't include editing videos, mastering DVDs, creating music, etc. These are all creative activities that once used to be dominated by desktops PCs and have slowly shifted to notebook PCs due to the incredible increase in mobile CPU capabilities. I'm also convinced it's not that great for blogging as the Safari browser on the iPad does not support multiple tabs. The fact of the matter is the iPad is used primarily for media consumption with the ability for limited creative work. I do agree that the iPad is simply beautiful and beautifully simple.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/edwardbaig/2010-03-31-apple-ipad-review_N.htm">Ed Baig</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the very least, the iPad will likely drum up mass-market interest in tablet computing in ways that longtime tablet visionary and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates could only dream of.</blockquote><br />
Baig ran off toward left field. The iPad is not about tablet <em>computing</em> per se. The iPad is a direct connection to media consumption. And a bit of creative work. Bill Gates probably still dreams of a day when tablet computing will happen with Microsoft's Courier concept. I hope the company's Courier concept becomes a reality as it really would convince me to drop my pad and pen.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/01/technology/personaltech/01pogue.html?hp">David Pogue</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>And the techies are right about another thing: the iPad is not a laptop. It's not nearly as good for creating stuff. On the other hand, it's infinitely more convenient for consuming it&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;books, music, video, photos, Web, e-mail and so on. For most people, manipulating these digital materials directly by touching them is a completely new experience&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and a deeply satisfying one.</blockquote><br />
Pogue gets the iPad.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2362040,00.asp">Tim Gideon</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But having used the iPad for some time, I can tell you that the device just makes sense.</blockquote><br />
<a href="http://www.theroot.com/views/techies-are-wrong-about-ipad">Omar Wasow</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The rest of us (even most techies) will be thrilled that doing what we want to do on the iPad is generally effortless.</blockquote><br />
Wasow is quite an optimist. I wouldn't assume any real techie would move away from specs and features and appreciate the iPad for what it is. I do agree the effortless interaction will be noticed internally even by techies but probably will not be publicly admitted with enthusiasm.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.chron.com/techblog/archives/2010/03/dr_mac_apples_ipad_is_better_than_expected.html">Bob LeVitus</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It turns out the iPad isn't as much a laptop replacement as I thought (though it could easily be used as one). Instead, it's an entirely new category of mobile device.</blockquote><br />
Mmm... didn't Steve Jobs already mention this?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/03/31/a-first-look-at-ipad.html">Xeni Jardin</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Just as the iPhone, Palm Pre and Android phones scratched an itch we didn't know we had&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;somewhere between cellphone and notebook&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the iPad hits a completely new pleasure spot.</blockquote><br />
That's an interesting way to put it. I don't quite agree about Android though. In my opinion the iPhone does everything that matters to ordinary folks much better than any Android phone can. WebOS on the Palm Pre is the closest thing to the iPhone OS and I appreciate the attention to the wonderful typography as well as multitasking. Oh and the QWERTY keyboard... there still is that something about a real mechanical keyboard.
