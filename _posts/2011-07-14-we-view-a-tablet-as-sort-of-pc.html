<p>Microsoft, Windows Phone division President, Andy Lees <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.winrumors.com/microsoft-outlines-vision-for-combining-windows-and-windows-phone">winrumors</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>You know, are we going to use Windows Phone 7 to produce tablets? Well, that is in conflict with this strategy. We view a tablet as a sort of PC. We want people to be able to do the sorts of things that they expect on a PC on a tablet...</blockquote></p>
<p>Prior to the iPhone, didn't Microsoft think a smartphone as a sort of PC? Now the company has seen the iPad and for some reason still views it as a sort of PC.</p>
