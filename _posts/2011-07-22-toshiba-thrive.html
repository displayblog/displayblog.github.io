<p>Dana Wollman, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/07/22/toshiba-thrive-review/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The 10.1-inch display crams in 1280 x 800 pixels, matching the Galaxy Tab 10.1 and other identically sized slates. Though it's plenty bright, the viewing angles aren't particularly wide. [...] As a bonus, Toshiba threw in the same Resolution+ technology it uses to clean up and upscale video on its laptops, but you'll be hard-pressed to notice the difference on such a small display.</blockquote></p>
<p>Display = tablet, a great display = a great tablet. Not so with the Thrive.</p>
