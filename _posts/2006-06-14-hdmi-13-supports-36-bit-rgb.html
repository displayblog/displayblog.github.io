<p>Facts: HDMI stands for High-Definition Multimedia Interface and was found and is controlled by Hitachi, Matsushita, Philips, Silicon Image, Sony, Thomson and Toshiba. 400+ firms have licensed HDMI. The new 1.3 specification has clock speeds increased from 165MHz to 225+MHz leading to more bandwidth and allowing for 1080 displays running at 60Hz with 36-bit RGB color (12-bit RGB for each sub-pixel) or a 1080 display with 90Hz. Leslie Chard, HDMI President, said clock rates up to 450MHz is technically feasible.</p>
<p>Opinion: At the SID show, I saw 120Hz 1080p displays. The increased frequency from 60Hz to 120Hz is needed to reduce motion blur artifacts. Other techniques such as blinking backlights, black frame insertion and OCB come together to reduce motion blur. I sure do hope HDMI can support 1920 x 1080 pixel format displays running at 120Hz with 30-bit RGB color because that is what the industry is moving towards. Of course, there is still very little content out there, which is a shame. HD-DVD or Blu-Ray supporters, get your act together and let's see some 1080p content!</p>
