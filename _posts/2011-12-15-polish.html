<blockquote><p>For many of us who make, use, or write about software for a living, polish is all about removing from the software as many jarring behaviors as possible. Sweating the small stuff. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s exactly the details like the persistently stuttering scrolling that MG points out that continue to make Android products appear less polished to us. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s seriously unnerving. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a big freaking deal to us, while other people just don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t see it.</blockquote></p>
