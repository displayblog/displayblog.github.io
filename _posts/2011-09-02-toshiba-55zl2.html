<p>Toshiba 55ZL2. 55-inch LED-backlit glasses-free 3D LCD TV. Quad full HD pixel format of 3840x2160. <a href="http://www.gizmag.com/toshiba-55zlz-55-inch-glasses-free-3d-tv/19692/">Gizmag</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Overall the 3D effect was more subtle, natural and real, with crisper images that seemed to recede into the background rather than jump out at you. In short, it's comfortable to look at.</blockquote></p>
<p>Available in late 2011. <em>Thanks Paul!</em></p>
