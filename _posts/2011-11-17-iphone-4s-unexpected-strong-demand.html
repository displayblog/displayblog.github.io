<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/11/17/iphone-4s-demand">John Gruber</a>. <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2011/11/17/would-be-iphone-customers-still-facing-weeks-long-waits/">Greg Bensinger, The Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Verizon Wireless customers may have to wait more than three weeks for the device, according to the carrier&acirc;&euro;&trade;s website. That compares with as much as 21 days at AT&T and up to 14 days at Sprint Nextel. While some tech blogs have suggested Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s manufacturing isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t keeping pace, the carriers point to unexpectedly strong demand for the handset.</blockquote></p>
<p>Strong demand for the iPhone 4S was unexpected? Unbelievable.</p>
