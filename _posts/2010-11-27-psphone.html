<p>This is from www.stuff.tv back in 2007, I think. A long time ago. But I still dig the design where the dual-sliding action reveals a keypad one way and directional controls the other way. We should have seen this PSPhone in 2008.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&sl=fr&tl=en&u=http://www.nowhereelse.fr/psp-phone-playstation-9-decembre-38045/&prev=_t&rurl=translate.google.com&twu=1&usg=ALkJrhg2KnJMwv2eg6vZ16qlFIFqpK20tg">Nowhereelse.fr</a>, Sony is working on a PSPhone and December 9th is the big day for an announcement in Paris, France.</p>
<p>If this rumor turns out to be true and Sony incorporates all the latest bells and whistles for gameplay (gyroscope, accelerometer, dual cameras, latest Android, multitouch, 1GHz+ Snapdragon, etc.) then the company has a good chance of challenging Apple's iPod touch in mobile gaming. Sony's PlayStation franchise has an enormous chest of games and the company can develop AirPlay-like features to allow a PSPhone to stream to a PlayStation 3 to play on Sony BRAVIA TVs. Maybe someone can even develop a software iOS emulator that can run on Android.</p>
