<blockquote><p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Payments is a tough ecosystem and you know, other players, other major consumer Internet companies have tried to enter in the space and have found, you know, limited success,&acirc;&euro; said Bill Ready, CEO of Braintree, the parent company of mobile payment services providers PayPal and Venmo. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;And a big part of that is it is a very difficult space.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple announced many Apple Pay retail partners including Macy&acirc;&euro;&trade;s, Bloomingdale&acirc;&euro;&trade;s, McDonald&acirc;&euro;&trade;s, Panera Bread, Target, Walgreens, Whole Foods Market, Starbucks, etc.</p>
<blockquote><p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;It's quite noteworthy that, you know, you had many of the largest retailers, most of the largest retailers, including Wal-Mart and Best Buy and others not part of the announcement,&acirc;&euro; he said.</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple Pay will fail, because it didn't get everyone. Damn.</p>
