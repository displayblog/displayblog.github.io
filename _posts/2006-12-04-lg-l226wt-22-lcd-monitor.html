<p>LG's L226WT is a 22" LCD monitor with a resolution of 1680 x 1050. Brightness is 300 cd/m2, contrast ratio 3000:1 and a response time of 5ms. I'm not sure if that's a typo, but a contrast ratio of 3000:1 is very high. The response time of 5ms is on the fast side. Viewing angles are 170 degrees, which tells me the panel seems to be of a TN+film type stead of the better IPS type. The casing is just as boring as many of the others.</p>

<p>The big sticker on the bottom right corner of the L226WT is one telling this monitor is Vista-ready. I'm not sure who cooked up this marketing campaign at Microsoft, but it's one of the silliest I've seen in a while. Is Microsoft telling us that a non-wide monitor is not going to be Vista friendly?</p>
<p>Most 22" LCD monitors have a resolution of 1680 x 1050. There are 20.1" 4:3 LCD monitors that are not wide that have a resolution of 1600 x 1200. Just as wide (80 pixels short) and 150 pixels taller. All in all, the 4:3 1600 x 1200 has more pixels. Ah, I forget: I'm probably talking to the marketing department at Microsoft.</p>
