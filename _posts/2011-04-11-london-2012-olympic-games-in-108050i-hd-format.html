<p><a href="http://panasonic.co.jp/corp/news/official.data/data.dir/en110411-4/en110411-4.html">Panasonic</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The London 2012 Olympic Games will be the tenth Olympic Games where Panasonic's digital technologies will be used as the official recording format since the Barcelona 1992 Olympic Games. The official international video will be produced and distributed from the International Broadcast Centre (IBC) in London Olympic Park, in 1080/50i High-Definition (HD) format, during the full 19 days of sporting competition for over 640 sessions, across more than 300 events in 26 sports on show during the London 2012 Olympic Games and expected to deliver the spectacular images of the world's biggest sporting event to the billions of TV viewers around the globe.</blockquote></p>
<p>I prefer a progressive scanning format like 720p for sports, but with enhanced de-interlacing capabilities of new TVs the difference is shrinking.</p>
