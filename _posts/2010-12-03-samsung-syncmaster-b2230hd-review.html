<blockquote><p>[...] were it to be judged purely as a TV, we would deem the Samsung to be a decent enough offering. It delivers bright, smooth and watchable pictures, with its major deficiencies in contrast and black level hidden to a degree by its small size. These issues become even more noticeable when used as a monitor, and the poor quality VGA connection doesn't help.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Samsung SyncMaster LD220HD is neither a master of TV or monitor.</p>
