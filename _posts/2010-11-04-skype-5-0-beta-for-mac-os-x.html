<p>The good, according to <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2010/11/04/skype-for-mac-the-tnw-complete-review/">TNW Apple</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The new Skype loads faster. Also searching for contacts is easier on the new Skype, and its practically instantaneous. My favorite feature is Skype&acirc;&euro;&trade;s integration with the Mac address book. I can only hope that a new Skype app for iPhone will have this feature too.</blockquote></p>
<p>The bad:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unfortunately a simplified Skype means you can only see one chat conversation at a time. ... The UI takes some getting used to, and the entire size of the new Skype is annoying.</blockquote></p>
<p>I'm not sure if I want to try this beta. I like my apps to be simple and compact. The <a href="http://www.skype.com/intl/en/get-skype/on-your-computer/macosx/beta/?cm_mmc=socialm%257Cskypeblogs-_-global%257Cintl%257Cen-_-bigblog-_-m5%257Cbeta">Skype 5.0 Beta for Mac OS X</a> seems to be less-than-compact.</p>
