<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/new-samsung-cortex-a15-based-chip-opens-door-to-retina-android-tablets/">Andrew Cunningham, Ars Technica</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>While the A15 will increase the Exynos 5's CPU power, its GPU might be more important as Android and Windows tablet manufacturers begin shipping Retina-esque displays to compete with the most recent iPad. The Mali-T604 is purpose-built for such devices: its maximum supported resolution is 2560x1600 (1280x800 doubled), and its 12.8GB/s theoretical memory bandwidth (the same as the A5X in the 2012 iPad) and 800MHz LPDDR3 RAM give it the memory bandwidth it needs to draw an image that large.</blockquote></p>
<p>The block diagram in the Ars Technica article shows WQXGA (2560x1600 or 2560x1440) support through eDP and 'FullHD' (1920x1080) support through MIPI. If I were to guess, tablets with displays beyond 1920x1080 will increasingly adopt eDP.</p>
