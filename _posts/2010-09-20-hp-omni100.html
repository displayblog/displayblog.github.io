<p>The HP Omni100 is the non-touch version of the TouchSmart all-in-one (AIO). The Omni100 sports a 20-inch LCD with a 1600x900 pixel format. Yes, the good-for-nothing pixel format: it isn't 1280x720 so you can watch 720p HD video and it isn't 1920x1080 so you can watch 1080p HD video. Scaling isn't a big an issue as before but if you're watching HD video content, I recommend non-scaled viewing. I assume HD video is why HP chose a 16:9 LCD panel and an easy-to-remember 1600x900 pixel format. Right?</p>
<p>Other than the less-than-optimal display choice, the Omni100 is powered by a 1.8GHz Athlon II and features 3GB RAM, 500GB HDD, and Radeon HD 4270 integrated graphics running Windows 7 with HP's MediaSmart UI. The Omni100 is priced to go at US$499.</p>
