<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20100210PD208.html">DigiTimes</a>: Thick bezels are ugly. I think Taiwan-based integrators and LCD manufacturers agree. Taiwan's major notebook PC ODMs are developing models sporting frameless displays or displays with very thin bezels. The companies in particular are Foxconn and Chimei Innolux, Compal Electronics and Chunghwa Picture Tubes (CPT), Quanta Computer and AU Optronics (AUO). Corning's Gorilla glass will be used as the cover glass for these thin-bezelled displays. Expect Acer and HP to bring notebooks with frameless displays to market in the second half of 2010.</p>
<p>The result of frameless displays is that notebooks will get smaller. If you can reduce the bezel of a display the entire chassis can be shrunk. You can get a 13.3-inch LCD in a chassis designed for a 12.1-inch LCD with thick bezels. Or you can fit larger LCDs into current chassis designs. For the ultimate example of a thin bezeled TV read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/01/06/lg-le9500-series-lcd-tv/">LG LE9500 Series LCD TV</a></em>.</p>
