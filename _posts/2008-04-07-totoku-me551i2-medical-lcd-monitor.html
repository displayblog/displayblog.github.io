The 5MP display is geared toward digital mammography. The incorporated a-Sentinel II system features a luminance sensor and luminance control circuit. The luminance sensor is integrated into the front bezel and consistently monitors and stabilizes luminance on the screen by communicating with the backlight sensor. Its a-Uniformity Congruence system equalizes luminance across the display for accurate brightness uniformity, which is critical in medial imaging applications. Totoku's website states that the ME551i2 medical monitor is capable of display 2048 shades of gray (per sub-pixel) with an integrated viewer. The ME551i2 has a 11.9-bit lookup table (LUT) that allows a pallet of 3826 shades of gray and can display 2048 shades with a specialized view and 256 shades without.<br />

Medical LCD monitors with a pixel format of 2560 x 2048 is extremely difficult to manufacture. To make sure it has zero pixel (and sub-pixel) defects is supremely difficult and very expensive. There are just a few LCD manufacturers today that continue to build these extremely important displays.<br />

Quest International, a Totoku distributor in the US, showcased a 12-bit, greyscale mammographic images that utilize an Apple Mac Pro (8-core), OsiriX and two Totoku ME551i2 medical LCD monitors at the Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM) that was held in Seattle, Washington. In early 2007, Apple approached Quest regarding displays that could be used with Mac systems for the medical market. Quest found the Totoku ME551i2 display could display a true 12-bit image with some software changes. Apple and Quest worked together to develop a software solution with the OsiriX software development team.<br />

OsiriX provides an advanced open-source Picture Archive and Communication Systems (PACS) workstation DICOM viewer that feature an intuitive and user-friendly interface tailored for physicians. The platform supports peer-to-peer technology as an alternative to the conventional PACS architecture. OsiriX is developing its tool for the iPhone platform that makes use of the iPhone's multi-touch capability to zoom in/out and rotate images. Totoku, based in Japan, was founded in 1940 and has been supplying high-end medical image displays since 1968.<br />
