<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/apple-v-samsung-legendary-mac-designer-testifies-about-copied-icons/">Joe Mullin, Ars Technica</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple swore in a former employee to make its case today: legendary icon designer Susan Kare, who testified that in her opinion, Samsung's screens and icons were illegal knockoffs of Apple designs.</p>
<p>Rachel Krevans, an Apple lawyer, walked Kare through screen after screen comparing Apple's D'305 patent&mdash;which shows a screen with icons like those on the iPhone&mdash;with various Samsung phones, including the Epic 4G, the Fascinate, and the Droid Charge. One after another, Kare testified that the Samsung icons and screens infringe Apple's design patent and its "trade dress," or the overall look of the phone.</blockquote></p>
