<p>The title says it all. Although September unit shipments for <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=chi-mei-optoelectronics">Chi Mei Optoelectronics</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=cmo">CMO</a>) of large-area (10" and larger) TFT LCD panels were up 12.4% M/M and 30.9% Y/Y to 6.708 million, the Q3'08 results were weak. Q3'08 shipments results were down 6.1% Q/Q but up 24% Y/Y to 17.5 million.</p>
<p><strong>L/A TFT LCD Panel Shipments</strong><br />
September: Up 12.4% M/M, up 30.9% Y/Y, 6.708 million<br />
Q3'08: Down 6.1% Q/Q, up 24% Y/Y, 17.512 million</p>
<p><strong>L/A TFT LCD Panel Revenues</strong><br />
September: Up 6% M/M, down 8.3% Y/Y, NT$30.224 billion<br />
Q3'08: Down 14.1% Q/Q, down 7% Y/Y, NT$81.988 billion</p>
<p>As you can see, September results show a tremendous amount of erosion in average selling prices (ASPs). Although shipment numbers were up 12.4% M/M, associated revenues were up just 6% M/M. I see the same situation on a quarterly basis where shipments were down 6.1% Q/Q but revenues tanked 14.1% Q/Q. This does not bode well for CMO. But it does mean that we could see some incredible deals on products with LCDs such as <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a>s coming around the corner.</p>
