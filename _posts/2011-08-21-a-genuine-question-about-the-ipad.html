<p>But here's a genuine question: how many of you actually use your tablet (of any brand) for productivity tasks as much as you thought you would when you lined up around the block to buy it? And after you invest a couple hundred in accessories to make it halfway useful, aren't you better off (financially and otherwise) with a bona fide laptop? For me, that answer is "yes."</p><br />

<p>How many of you actually use your sports car (of any brand) for hauling your family as much as you thought you would when you spent all that money to buy it? And after you invest a couple thousand in accessories to make it halfway useful, aren't you better off (financially and otherwise) with a bona fide SUV? For me, that answer is "depends".</p></p>
<p>It depends on what I'm looking for. If I want a light, nimble, two-seater sports car for the me and the Mrs., I'm not going to bemoan the lack of seating for my entire family. A sports car doesn't do everything a SUV can. A tablet, and in particular the iPad, doesn't do everything a full-blown notebook can. Isn't that obvious?</p></p>
