<blockquote><p>[...] Apple seems to be successfully pursuing the same strategy that works in any streetfight: keep knocking your opponent&acirc;&euro;&trade;s feet out from other him just when he&acirc;&euro;&trade;s about to get up. It doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t hurt that they also seem to be the only tablet manufacturer that diligently thinks their designs through from start to finish.</blockquote></p>
