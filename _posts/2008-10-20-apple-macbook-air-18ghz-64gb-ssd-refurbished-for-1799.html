<p>In the Apple "Special Deals" section you can get some really great deals. I personally thingk refurbished models are better than new. My reason is simple: anything that was going to break, broke, and Apple fixed it for you. For instance, the <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/FB450LL/A">MacBook Air with a 1.8GHz Intel Core 2 Duo CPU, 2GB RAM and 64GB SSD can be had for just $1799</a>. For $1799 you could also get a brand new <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=macbook-air">MacBook Air</a> with a 1.6GHz Intel Core 2 Duo CPU (with 1066MHz FSB), 2GB RAM and a 120GB SATA HDD. Of course the new one packs in a CPU with a faster FSB and a better GPU in the NVIDIA GeForce 9400M. If you want to enjoy a solid-state notebook PC with no moving parts (except for the liquid crystals in the LCD) and for cheap, the 1.8GHz MBA (first generation) with 64GB SSD might be a great deal for you. BTW, the first generation model also uses the single-aluminum-slab manufacturing method like the new ones.</p>
