<blockquote><p>The background section of Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s complaint has a couple interesting nuggets in it: Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s sold &acirc;&euro;&oelig;over 60 million&acirc;&euro;¬ù iPod touches as of March 2011, which is the first time a specific number has ever been broken out for that device, and we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re also told that 108m iPhones and 19m iPads have been sold. What&acirc;&euro;&trade;s more, Apple spent more than $2 billion advertising the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad during its fiscal years 2007 to 2010.</blockquote></p>
