<p><strong>Media Pad</strong> In an interview with Hexus, Mike Rayfield, the general manager of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=nvidia&amp;sa=Search">NVIDIA</a>'s mobile unit, mentioned a "media pad" that sports a "3G capable touchpad" with display sizes ranging from 7- to 13-inches that will use the company's Tegra, a high-power, low-weight chipset. Combine this with the rumor that <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/07/13/apple-ibook-9-7-inch-slate/">Apple is working on some type of a media pad with a 9.7-inch</a> display, falling squarely in that size range. I think it will be called the iBook but there are <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/08/14/apple-ipad-itouch/">rumors that it will be called the iPad</a>. This media pad will certainly compete with netbooks and ebook readers like <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=amazon+kindle&amp;sa=Search">Amazon's Kindle</a>. I include netbooks because most of the activity on the tiny notebooks are mostly of the consumption variety: read email, surf Internet, listen to music, read books, news, magazines, etc. The iBook or iPad will probably center around consumption activities. I do think it will have an on-screen keyboard for real 'touch' typing but the primary focus will be on media consumption, not creation.</p>

<p><strong>AT&amp;T No, Verizon Yes</strong> The 3G connection could be with current partner AT&amp;T. But with its ginormous size and sluggish response (no SMS, no tethering while all other iPhone 3GS providers in the <em>entire</em> world already supports these two services), AT&amp;T might not be the best choice. In addition, the US government has initiated an investigation probing whether there is a case for antitrust proceedings. When the US government gets nosey the company suffers greatly: IBM and Microsoft are good examples. On the other hand, Verizon has already started field testing its 4G data connection called LTE (Long Term Evolution). A much smaller Sprint has a 4G connection too.</p>
