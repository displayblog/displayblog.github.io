<p>The <a href="http://www.westinghousedigital.com/details.aspx?itemnum=111">Westinghouse Digital</a> SK-32H240S is a 720p capable 32-inch LCD TV. The pixel format is 1366x768 and has a decent 1200:1 contrast ratio. There are opinions that suggest the human visual system is not capable of distinguishing the extra detail from a 1080p capable 32-inch LCD TV viewing from appropriate distances. So on a 32-inch LCD TV, you're good to go with just a 1366x768 pixel format.</p>
<p>The viewing angle isn't as wide as some other LCD TVs but it is good enough at 176/176. You most likely will not miss the 2 degrees. The 8ms response time isn't the fastest out there and you'll probably be able to see some motion blur: just try to stay away from sports and watch romantic comedies with your significant other. It also might be a good idea to calibrate the SK-32H240S for best results. The best part about the SK-32H240S is its price: around US$500.</p>
