<p>Meizu's miniOne is a smartphone that looks remarkably like Apples iPhone. The CEO of Meizu, J. Wong, stated that the miniOne will come in two versions: 4GB and 8GB. Just like the iPhone! But unlike the iPhone the price will be much much smaller: $195 to $400. There is another big difference: the LCD. The LCD on the miniOne will be a 3.2" LCD with a whopping 720 x 480 pixels! The added number of pixels will definitely enhance the "Internet communicator" function of the <strike>iPhone</strike> miniOne.</p>
