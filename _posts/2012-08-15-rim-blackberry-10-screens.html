<blockquote><p>Full touchscreen devices will have a 1280 x 720 resolution (aka 720p, the popular 16:9 aspect ratio), and devices with the traditional portrait QWERTY keyboard will also have a traditional square screen at 720 x 720.</blockquote></p>
<p>RIM is firmly planting one foot in the past&mdash;a recipe not for success.</p>
