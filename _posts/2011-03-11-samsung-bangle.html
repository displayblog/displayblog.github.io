<p>Samsung <em>via</em> <a href="http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2933353">Korea Joongang Daily</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is an investment to secure a famous global designer in order to make our designs more luxurious. We will set up a design research center for Bangle in a European location, such as Italy, and have about 10 researchers from Samsung work with him.</blockquote></p>
<p>That's Chris Bangle famed for some controversially ugly designs at BMW, including the most luxurious 7 Series sedan.</p>
