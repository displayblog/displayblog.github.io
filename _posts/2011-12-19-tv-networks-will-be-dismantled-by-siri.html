<blockquote><p>But from my perspective, Siri&acirc;&euro;&trade;s greatest impact won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t ultimately be on users, or on device manufacturers (though they certainly risk losing market share to Apple). It will be on the TV industry&acirc;&euro;&trade;s content creators and packagers. Why? Because a voice-controlled television interface will fundamentally disrupt the six-decade-old legacy structure of networks, channels, and programs. And that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a legacy that &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; until now, at least &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; has been carried forward from analog to digital.</blockquote></p>
<p>Siri is like a point-to-point protocol where you get direct access to only the content you wish to view.</p>
