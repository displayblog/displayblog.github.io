<p><a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-3121_7-57437111-220/why-a-retina-display-on-a-macbook-could-be-a-bad-idea/">Dan Ackerman, CNET</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The current high-end resolution for laptops is 1,920x1,080 pixels [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>Not really. I'm working on a 1920x1200 MacBook.</p>
<blockquote><p>Even if Apple trades up to a much higher resolution than any other laptop but still manages to keep things readable, that would mean resolution and screen size alone would no longer give you a fixed idea of what content (Web sites, games, photos, etc.) would look like on a laptop screen. This could make comparison shopping confusing, and it would be another example of different computer manufacturers using different standards.</blockquote></p>
<p>Why of course, Apple is in the business of ensuring maximum ease in comparison shopping.</p>
<p>We typically use the word resolution to mean something like 1920x1200, but that's wrong. 1920x1200 is a pixel format; resolution is pixel density, like 300 ppi. With that said, pixel format and screen size is not what determine how images and text look on a display. To some extent they do since we hardly change the DPI settings in our operating systems. And that DPI setting, a resolution setting, is what really determines how things look.</p>
<p>A 1920x1200 17-inch display sports a 133 ppi resolution. Let's assume the DPI setting in OS X is at 133 ppi. Now if Apple decides to equip the 17-inch MacBook with a 3840x2400 retina display. The DPI setting at 266 ppi will show images, texts, etc. with the exact same size on both displays. The only difference is the Retina display 17-inch MacBook will have images and texts that are as crisp as those on the new iPad.</p>
<blockquote><p>A Retina Display would likely need more power, which would lead to either a bigger battery (and thicker chassis) or shorter battery life, or both.</blockquote></p>
<p>Consider this: The MacBook Airs do not have optical drives. There is the possibility of an optical drive-free MacBook Pro. That leaves a good chunk of space to add more battery. A bigger more efficient battery, yes. A thicker chassis, no. Shorter battery life, no. Both, definitely no.</p>
<blockquote><p>But, I have to admit, in many years of reviewing laptops, no shopper has every told me he or she wanted a screen resolution higher than 1,920x1,080.</blockquote></p>
<p>I'm so glad, thanks to Steve Jobs, Apple doesn't conduct focus groups to find out what customers want.</p>
