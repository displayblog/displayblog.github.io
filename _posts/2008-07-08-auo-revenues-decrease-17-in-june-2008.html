<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=au-optronics">AU Optronics</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=auo">AUO</a>) announced June consolidated revenues and the results aren't positive. Consolidated revenues in June decreased 17.2% M/M and 5.7% Y/Y to NT$36.7 billion (about US$1.21 billion). For Q2'08, consolidated revenues declined 9.6% Q/Q and increased 16.5% Y/Y to NT$123.5 billion.</p>
<p>Large-area LCD shipments reached 6.7 million units in June representing a sequential decline of 12.9%. Large-area LCD shipments in Q2'08 decreased 0.9% Q/Q and increased 12% Y/Y to 21.8 million units.</p>
<p>Small/medium LCD shipments decreased 2.7% M/M to 13.5 million units in June. For Q2'08, small/medium shipments were up 11.1% Q/Q and 29.9% Y/Y to 41.9 million units. The US economy, a very important market for LCD consumption, has been rocky YTD and the future is uncertain. 2H'08 just began but expecting a huge surge in demand for LCD-related goods might be too optimistic. There are channel inventories that need to be cleared out as well.</p>
