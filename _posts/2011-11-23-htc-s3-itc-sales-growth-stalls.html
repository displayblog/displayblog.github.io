<blockquote><p>Both VIA and HTC share the same owner, Formosa Plastics Group, a Taiwanese conglomerate whose diverse interests include biotechnology, petrochemical processing and production of electronics components. The entity is owned by the Wang family. The wife of VIA Technologies&acirc;&euro;&trade; CEO is Ms. Cher Wang, chairperson and co-founder of HTC. In July, VIA Technologies, the original owner of S3 Graphics, won a lawsuit against Apple over infringement of two of S3 Graphics&acirc;&euro;&trade; patents in Mac products.</blockquote></p>
<p>Plan A: Transfer S3 from VIA to HTC. Hit Apple hard. Plan B: Let's not implement Plan A.</p>
