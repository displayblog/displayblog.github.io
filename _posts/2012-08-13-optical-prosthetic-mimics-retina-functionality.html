<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/08/sight-for-sore-eyes-optical-prosthetic-mimics-retina-functionality/">Kyle Niemeyer, Ars Technica</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In order to solve this problem, <a href="http://physiology.med.cornell.edu/faculty/profile.php?id=nirenberg">Sheila Nirenberg</a> and <a href="http://physiology.med.cornell.edu/faculty/nirenberg/lab/chethan/index.html">Chethan Pandarinath</a> of Cornell University developed a new optical prosthetic system that consists of two parts that mimic the functionality of an actual retina. An encoder takes visual information and transforms it into the form needed by the ganglion cells. This functions much like a compiler, converting human-readable source code into machine code needed by the computer. In a healthy retina, this transformation (&acirc;&euro;&oelig;visual phototransduction&acirc;&euro;¬ù) is performed by the photoreceptor cells&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the rods and cones. The second component is the transducer, which takes the signal from the encoder&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;now in the proper pattern&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and stimulates the ganglion cells, in effect executing the code.</blockquote></p>
<p>I can imagine one day where digital visual information is pumped straight into the transducer.</p>
