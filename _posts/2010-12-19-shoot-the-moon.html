<p>Most LCDs exhibit brightness and color shifts when you look at the display at angles. On a crappy display the shift is most pronounced when you move up and down. </p>

<blockquote><p>Move your head up and down to see the moon lose its glow...</blockquote></p>
<p>Doghouse Diaries takes advantage of this brightness & color shifting characteristic on LCDs to make the moon come alive. Brilliant.</p>
