<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/01/the_church_of_market_share">John Gruber</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The truth is, the average Android user is not the same as the average iPhone user. iPhone users <a href="http://www.mobilemarketingwatch.com/mobile-web-browsing-dominated-by-apples-ios-20233/">surf the web more</a>, they're <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2011/07/11/research-shows-apple-customers-buy-more-apps-pay-more-for-them/">more willing to buy software</a>, they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re <a href="http://moconews.net/article/419-average-number-of-apps-downloaded-to-iphone-40-android-25/">more willing to install and use apps</a>. Some of these stats aren&acirc;&euro;&trade;t even close. What I see as the fundamental flaw in the Church of Market Share doctrine is the assumption that users are users.</blockquote></p>
