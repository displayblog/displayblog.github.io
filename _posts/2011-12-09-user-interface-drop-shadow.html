<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/12/9/2616204/the-condescending-ui">Paul Miller, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But it's not just functionality, there's something deeper that bugs me, about the decorations themselves. Like the ubiquitous drop shadow. "Did you know that <em>this</em> window is on top of <em>this</em> window?" it whispers to me, endlessly. Apple's love of reflections and faux 3D subtly imply to me that I might be lost, needing landmarks and a sense of place to find my way.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote><p>He also has some idiotic points about not needing window shadows &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; umm yeah we don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t need them, but we also like for our UI to not look like shit.</blockquote></p>
<p>I'm with Miller; I dislike window drop shadows as they are implemented on OS X Lion. I think the shadows are too thick and looking through online discussions they are 40 pixels thick. I'm not a designer, but I don't think I would use 40-pixel thick drop shadows on <em>anything</em>. Since there doesn't seem to be a way to reduce the thickness I have decided a while ago to get rid of them.</p>
<p>I searched high and low to find a lightweight app to disable them on OS X Lion. I thought I found it in <a href="http://www.blacktree.com/">Nocturne by Blacktree</a>, but it only partially does the trick: Shadows are disabled only when in 'Night' mode and when in that mode the background turns white. I like my background black, so back to searching I went. I kept Nocturne because it has a few other nifty UI tricks like hiding the desktop and the menu bar. Do you really need the menu bar to be visible 100% of the time?</p>
<p>After searching and reading through forums for a while I found what looked like wouldn't work on Lion: <a href="http://unsanity.com/haxies/shadowkiller">ShadowKiller by Unsanity</a>. It states it isn't compatible with OS X 1.6 Leopard. So the reasoning goes it wouldn't work with Lion, but I gave it a try anyway. Good thing I did. Window drop shadows are a thing of the past for me, and good riddance.</p>
<p>All UI elements pertaining to windows visually end at the edges of the window. The visual feeling I get is the satisfaction of having cut off unnecessary fat. There's also a certain cleanliness to it. This is how it should be and how I like it. I think I prefer no drop shadows at all to thinner drop shadows. But there's a reason.</p>
<p>About 99% of the time I interact with windows that are flush; I almost never interact with free floating windows. I use an app called <a href="http://5amcode.com/">DoublePane by 5am Code</a> to position windows one of three ways: left half, right half, full screen. And it is because I use windows this way that zero drop shadows work so well for me. Free floating windows don't work quite well without any type of border; what I think would work brilliantly is a single pixel border in light grey.</p>
<p>When it comes to UI my preference is less. Always less. Through a few other apps I've disabled most animations on Lion. On Safari I've hidden every single bar (Toolbar, Bookmarks Bar, Status Bar); I use keyboard shortcuts instead. I use <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred by Running with Crayons</a> to launch apps, look up words, google, etc. If I could I'd get rid of the Dock; there's very little need for it. I'm a minimalist when it comes to UI. So, regarding window drop shadows: Apple implemented 40-pixel thick drop shadows in Lion. That's <em>way</em> too thick and makes the UI look less elegant. Although I wouldn't object to thinner, say three pixels wide, drop shadows I haven't found a way to do that. So I'm running drop shadow-less windows on Lion and loving it.</p>
