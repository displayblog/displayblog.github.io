<p>This is how you pay: take out your iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, open the Apple Pay app, and put your finger on the TouchID home button. The technology: NFC.</p>
<p>Security is number one, so Apple Pay does not give out card numbers but instead sends a one-time payment number and a dynamic security code. That CC code? No need to show it to anyone anymore.</p>
<p>If you lose your iPhone 6 or 6 Plus all payments can be suspended using the Find My iPhone app. No need to cancel your credit cards, which is convenient. Another aspect of security is that Apple won't know a thing about what you do. What you buy, when, and for how much are all private.</p>
<p>American Express, MasterCard, and VISA are in as well as these financial institutions: Citi, Bank of America, Capital One, Wells Fargo, and Chase.</p>
<p>Where can you use Apple Pay? Macy's, Bloomingdale's, Wallgreens, McDonald's (drive through included), Whole Foods, Panera Bread, Sephora, Petco, Toys R Us, Babies R Us, Staples, Disney, Apple (of course), and 22,000 other retailers. Online too: Groupon, Uber, MLB.com, OpenTable, Starbucks, Tickets.com, Target, Apple, Sephora, Instacart, and Disney.</p>
