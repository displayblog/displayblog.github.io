<p><a href="http://www.lgphilips-lcd.com/homeContain/jsp/eng/inv/inv101_j_e.jsp?BOARD_IDX=1440&amp;languageSec=E&amp;kinds=IN1">LG.Philips LCD</a>: On February 12, LG.Philips LCD (LPL) announced that it will change its name to just LG Display (LGD). Of course, its shareholders will need to approve the name change at the end of this month. As you can see the name Philips will be gone and that is due to a significant reduction of its equity stake in the LPL joint venture. Once approved, LPL will register the new name on March 3 with both the official name and trademark to be LG Display. The entire process is expected to be finished by June 2008. I wonder if LPL will also change its ticker symbol from LPL to something else like LGD.</p>
