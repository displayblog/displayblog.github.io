<p><a href="http://www.photographyblog.com/index.php/weblog/comments/lacie_730_724_and_720_monitors/">PhotographyBlog</a> <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/09/10/lacies-new-lcds-put-ntsc-to-shame/">Engadget</a>: RGB LED backlighting is the future, now. LaCie introduced its 700 Series professional LCD monitors in three sizes: 20" (Model 720, 4:3), 24" (Model 724, 16:10) and 30" (Model 730, 16:10). I'll be talking about the Lacie 724 with a 24" S-PVA LCD. S-PVA, an enhanced version of PVA, which stands for Patterned Vertical Alignment, is manufactured by Samsung's LCD division and is considered one of the best types of LCD panels for wide viewing angles and is just a notch under Super IPS (S-IPS) technology, which is an enhanced version of In Plane Switching (IPS). A recent entrent into the RGB LED backlit LCD monitor space is HP's DreamColor LP2480zx that uses a S-IPS RGB LED backlit LCD panel.</p>

The 724 has a pixel format of 1920 x 1200 and sports a RGB LED backlight. The special backlight generates a color gamut of 123% Adobe RGB and should be thoroughly welcomed by professionals that require extreme color fidelity on their monitors. The 724 along with the rest is a fairly thick monitor, but that's the trade off since a RGB LED backlight requires some space for the LED light sources to be spread across the expansive 24" LCD. It seems the 700 Series is only available in the UK at the moment. I am sure availability for the US will be in short order.</p>
