<p><a href="http://www.yankodesign.com/2011/06/29/iphone-5-really/">Yanko Design</a>: Designer Michal Bonikowski shares his iPhone 5 concept. One of the main reasons why Apple went with a curved design for the new iPod touch was to eliminate a dimension. The curved back serves as both the back and the sides of the iPod touch, resulting in a sturdier and rugged design.</p>
<p>This iPhone 5 concept has both a curved back <em>and</em> the external antenna band. I don't think Apple would do that. I'm fairly sure if Apple decides to curve the back of the iPhone 5 that it would do that to eliminate the side, exactly like the latest iPod touch and similar to the 3G and 3GS.</p>
