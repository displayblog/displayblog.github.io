<blockquote><p>The design lets the device's shape reflect its functionality: folded as a book for reading e-books, a tablet for browsing newspapers or in crowded environments, or a laptop when preparing typed documents. 'flexbook' is also easily<br />
portable, serving as its own case when folded it in half.</blockquote></p>
<p>With Samsung's announcement of a seamless bendable AMOLED display, this flexbook concept doesn't look like much of a concept at all. Hope someone makes it, soon.</p>
