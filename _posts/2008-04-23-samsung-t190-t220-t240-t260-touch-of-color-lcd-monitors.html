<p>Samsung announced on April 23, 2008 the launch of its Touch of Color (TOC) line of LCD monitors: T190, T220, T240, and T260. They have a minimalist design, a deep ruby red infusion, and a glossy piano-black finish. From the picture, the TOC design looks very nice. But I prefer a different color: blue. By introducing a color, Samsung has put itself into a position of having to introduce more color varieties in the future. Not good or bad, just pressure.</p>
<p>The 20,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio for a LCD monitor is pretty impressive. I really do hope that Samsung puts in a Super PVA LCD panel into the T240 and T260 models. That might not happen as the price of the 24" T240 is very aggressive. Very aggressive pricing almost always equal TN+Film technology. We can expect street prices to be found at much lower than $499 for the T240 at the end of July.</p>
