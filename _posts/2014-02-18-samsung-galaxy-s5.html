<p>There's a rumor the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S5 will feature a fingerprint sensor built into the home button. <a href="http://www.sammobile.com/2014/02/17/explained-samsungs-implementation-of-the-fingerprint-sensor-on-the-upcoming-galaxy-s5/">SamMobile</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The sensor itself works in a swipe manner, which means that you would need to swipe the entire pad of your finger, from base to tip, across the home key to register your fingerprint properly. Also, you would need to keep your finger flat against the home key and swipe at a moderate speed or else it won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t recognise your fingerprint. The fingerprint sensor is sensitive to moisture, as well. So, don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t try to use it with wet fingers because it will, literally, give you an error and tell you to dry your fingers first.</blockquote></p>
<p>I haven't heard many good things about swipe fingerprint sensors. I have an old ThinkPad with a fingerprint reader, which is of the swipe variety. I played with it a while and realized the added security is not worth the frustration of it not properly registering my fingerprints. The fingerprint reader was never used again on that ThinkPad. Yes, it was an old ThinkPad circa 2004 I think, so swipe fingerprint sensors will have definitely improved.</p>
<p>There are more rumors. Samsung will most likely unveil the Galaxy S5 at its Unpacked 5 event on February 24 in Barcelona, Spain during Mobile World Congress. The rumor originates from Chinese website <a href="http://digi.tech.qq.com/a/20140106/002101.htm#ystfuv">Tencent</a> and is reported by <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s5_rumored_to_use_sharps_2k_display-news-7488.php">GSM Arena</a>: Samsung will incorporate a larger 5.25-inch LTPS LCD, not OLED, manufactured by Sharp. The pixel format is 2560x1440 for a resolution of 560 ppi. If true this will be a move by Samsung that breaks tradition as all Galaxy S-line of smartphones have used OLED displays. The reasons may be the difficulty of miniaturizing OLED pixels, which is more challenging than doing the same with LCD, and Samsung concluded it cannot manufacture enough 5.25-inch 2560x1440 OLED displays due to lower yields for what will be a highly anticipated smartphone.</p>
<p>If this rumor ends up being true &mdash; a 5.25-inch LTPS LCD with 2560x1440 pixels and (I'm adding this part) IPS-like features such as wide viewing angles, accurate colors, and little color/contrast/brightness &mdash; the Galaxy S5 would sport the most fantastic display on a smartphone. I hope the battery lasts.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/24/5441668/samsung-galaxy-s5-announcement-launch">Dan Seifert, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The S5&acirc;&euro;&trade;s display is ever so slightly larger at 5.1 inches, but it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s still a 1080p, Super AMOLED panel that doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t look very different from the S4&acirc;&euro;&trade;s screen.</blockquote></p>
<p>Oh well, I guess all that chatter about a 2560x1440 IPS LCD was just a hopeful rumor.</p>

<p>Gruber can be so direct.</p>
