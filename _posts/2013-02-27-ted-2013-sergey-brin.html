<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/02/27/brin-glass">John Gruber</a>. Casey Newton, <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57571612-94/sergey-brin-smartphones-are-emasculating/">c|net</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Speaking at <a href="http://conferences.ted.com/TED2013/">the TED Conference today</a> in Long Beach, Calif., Brin told the audience that smartphones are "emasculating." "You're standing around and just rubbing this featureless piece of glass," he said.</blockquote></p>
<p>Emasculate:</p>
<li>Make weaker or less effective</li>
<li>Deprive of his male role or identity</li>
<p>What a weird thing to say. And almost none of us rub our smartphone displays, unless we're trying to clean them. Weirdness aside, Google Glass meets a very specific need: Photos or videos from a first person point of view requiring both hands to be free.</p>
