<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://512pixels.net/siri-tells-boy-off/">Stephen Hackett</a>. <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/8984155/iPhone-Siri-software-tells-boy-12-to-shut-up-in-Tesco.html">The Telegraph</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Charlie Le Quesne was trying out the iPhone 4S at a Tesco store in Coventry when it told him: "Shut the f*** up, you ugly t***."</blockquote></p>
<p>Hilarious.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Siri system addresses the phone's user by name &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; using information entered in its contact system.</blockquote></p>
<p>Some smart aleck told Siri "shut the f*** up you ugly t***" was his name. You wanna hear something more funny? Tesco:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have launched an investigation. The handset will be going back to Apple for diagnostic tests.</blockquote></p>
<p>Can't make this stuff up.</p>
