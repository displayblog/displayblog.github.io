<p><a href="http://www.isuppli.com/Display-Materials-and-Systems/MarketWatch/Pages/US-Consumers-Unwilling-to-Buy-New-TVs-Now-at-All-Time-High-of-83-Percent,-Citing-Economic-Fears.aspx">Riddhi Patel</a>, iSuppli:</p>
<blockquote><p>Spooked by a sputtering economy, an overwhelming number of American consumers are choosing to forgo purchasing what has become the centerpiece of entertainment in U.S. households&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a  new &iuml;&not;&sbquo;at-screen television, according to a new IHS iSuppli U.S. TV Consumer Preference Analysis report from information and analysis provider IHS.</blockquote></p>
<p>Some other possible reasons:</p></p>
<ul>
<li>U.S. consumers are content.</li>
<li>The TVs they have are big enough.</li>
<li>They have enough TVs.</li>
<li>They are not interested in buying a 3D TV.</li>
<li>They are not interested in buying a "smart TV".</li>
<li>They want to watch less TV.</li>
<li>They would rather spend money on something else.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>83% of 45000+ randomly polled U.S. households in the second quarter of 2011 had no intention of buying a new TV in the next 12 months. Good for them.</p>
