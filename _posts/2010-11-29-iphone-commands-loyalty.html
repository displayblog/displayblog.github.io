<p><a href="http://us.mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6AS0XB20101129?ca=rdt">Reuters</a> reporting on the results of a GfK smartphone loyalty survey:</p>
<blockquote><p>The survey found that just 25 percent of smartphone owners planned to stay loyal to the operating system running their phone, with loyalty highest among Apple users at 59 percent, and lowest for Microsoft's phone software, at 21 percent.</p>
<p>Of users of Research in Motion's BlackBerrys, 35 percent said they would stay loyal. The figure was 28 percent for users of phones running Google's Android software, and 24 percent for users of Nokia Symbian phones.</blockquote></p>
<p>Let's put it more simply:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple iPhone: 59%</li>
<li>RIM BlackBerry: 35%</li>
<li>Android: 24%</li>
<li>Microsoft: 21%</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>It isn't surprising that Microsoft is lowest. Why? Microsoft is in a major transition from suck to quite good. BlackBerry users tend to be loyal because a good portion of their loyalty is to a portrait QWERTY keyboard and universal accessibility to their emails. I don't know what to say about Android other than that there might be a good chance that its users might become loyal to Google's cloud syncing capabilities. Google is way ahead of the pack when it comes to cloud-syncing email, calendar, documents, photos, etc.</p>
<p>What more is there to say about the iPhone that hasn't been already said? The iPhone makes your life easier. As long as you're in an area with strong AT&T signals.</p>
