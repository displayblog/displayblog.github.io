<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lg">LG</a> has three Black Label Series: <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=chocolate">Chocolate</a>, Shine and Secret. LG's Secret Black Label Series is now available in South Korea. From the pictures, the Secret looks pretty good with that fairly large <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=2.4">2.4"</a> LCD on the front and other characteristics like a carbon fiber back. The Secret is a slider phone with a massive 5MP camera that's very thin at just 11.8mm (0.46").</p>

<p><strong>Neon Touch Navigation</strong> This unique feature was inspired by the way ripples appear when objects touch water surfaces. And when you touch these four rippling blue buttons they vibrate, delicately.</p>

<p><strong>Carbon Fiber</strong> The back of the Secret is carbon fiber. I don't see the words carbon fiber "look" so I am guessing it is for real. Carbon fiber brings down the weight while maintaining ruggedness and there's always that high-tech look that comes from this material.</p>
<p><strong>Auto Luminance Control</strong> With an ambient light sensor, the Secret BL has the ability to control the brightness of the screen. This allows for optimum viewing experience and saves a bit of power as well.</p>
<p><strong>Auto Rotating Display</strong> I guess this is thanks to an accelerometer. A 2.4" LCD is not small, but the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=240-x-320">240 x 320</a> pixel format probably won't make that much of a difference in either portrait or landscape modes. But the auto-rotation capability will come in handy when you want a bit more width than length.</p>
<p><strong>Tempered Glass</strong> This is important in keeping your fairly expensive and very sexy Secret phone in pristine condition. The tempered glass is hardened via a heating process and probably can withstand a bit more bumps and bruises than the average mobile phone.</p>
