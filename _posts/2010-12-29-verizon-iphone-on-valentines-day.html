<p><a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/12/29/apple_expected_to_hold_event_by_valentines_day_to_announce_verizon_iphone.html">AppleInsider</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple is expected to hold an event "very soon," perhaps by Valentine's Day on Feb. 14, 2011, to unveil a new CDMA version of the iPhone compatible with U.S. carrier Verizon's network.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://www.electronista.com/articles/10/12/29/apple.may.hold.on.verizon.iphone.until.after.ces/">electronista</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple's rollout for the Verizon iPhone will wait until after CES wraps up, sources said Wednesday night. The launch would arrive until sometime after the event's end on January 9, but when it would take place hadn't been narrowed down. Bloomberg speculated that it might come before Valentine's Day but didn't claim inside knowledge.</blockquote></p>
<p>Nothing is certain until Apple sends out invitations to a media event. The iPad was unveiled during a media event on January 27, 2010. Will Apple announce its next iPad and a Verizon iPhone at the same time? If so that'll be around late January 2011.</p>
