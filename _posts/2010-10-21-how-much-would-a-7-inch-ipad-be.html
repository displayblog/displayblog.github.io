<p>During Apple's fiscal fourth quarter earnings call Steve Jobs put the kibosh on a 7-inch iPad. Read <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/10/18/steve-jobs-7-inch-tablets-doa/">Steve Jobs: 7-inch Tablets DOA</a>. But if Apple were to make a 7-inch iPad how much would it be?</p>
<p>Here's a guess: A lot less than $499 for a WiFi-only version and a lot less than $629 for a WiFi+3G version. That's for sure.</p>
<p>And in this thought experiment, that makes the $600 Samsung Galaxy Tab (WiFi+3G) expensive.</p>
