<p><a href="http://uk.news.yahoo.com/pocketli/20071025/ttc-lg-flatron-m228wd-widescreen-monitor-57dbc65_1.html">Yahoo! News UK &amp; Ireland</a>: The new M228WD is similar to LG's M228WA in overall design except for the silver belly vs. the black belly in the M228WD (this might actually be a color option for both). However, the M228WD has a digital TV tuner built-in. So this new entrant from LG is one of those rare multi-function monitors that can be used as a monitor and as something else: in this case, a TV. I am sure normal HD TV programs will look decent enough, but without motion-blur reduction technologies like 120Hz frequencies or ultra-fast response times (5ms is not that bad) motion blur will be a problem when you're watching fast moving video like sports. The HDMI input is welcome as those who want to connect a HD-DVD/Blu-ray player, PS3/Xbox 360, Apple TV, etc., can.</p>
