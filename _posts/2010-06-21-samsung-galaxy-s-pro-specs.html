<p>Samsung's Galaxy S Pro specs according to <a href="http://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s-pro-specs-begin-emerge">Android Central</a> include: Samsung 1GHz ARM Cortex A8 CPU, QWERTY keyboard, forward-facing 640x480 camera, 5 megapixel camera with 720p video recording, WiFi BGN, H.264 and DivX playback, Sprint TV and support for WiMAX. I'm picky not only with displays but with keyboards too: the keyboard has raised soft-plastic keys, which I think will do the trick in providing a solid typing experience. I'll need to fiddle with the real thing to be sure. The Galaxy S Pro runs Android 2.1 and seems to be quite responsive to touch and keyboard input.</p>
<p>The question that hasn't been answered authoritatively is whether or not the Galaxy S Pro sports the same 4-inch 800x480 Super AMOLED display. My guess is that the AMOLED display on the Galaxy S Pro would be at least as good as the Super AMOLED used in the non-Pro Galaxy S. For more information about the Super AMOLED display check out <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/21/super-amoled-is-decent-in-the-sun/"><em>Super AMOLED Is Decent In The Sun</em></a> and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/17/samsung-galaxy-s-with-super-amoled/"><em>Samsung Galaxy S with Super AMOLED</em></a>.</p>
