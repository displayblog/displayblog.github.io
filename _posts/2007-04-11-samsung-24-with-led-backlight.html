<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=samsung">Samsung</a> Electronics Co., Ltd., announced volume production of its <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=24"">24"</a> LCD with a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led-backlight">LED backlight</a> starting Q2'07. The LED light source improves the color gamut typically just 72% NTSC to 111%. Samsung knocks the smaller 22" size: "... not wide enough to support full-HD." In fact, 22" LCD monitors with just <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1680-x-1050">1680 x 1050</a> pixels can't support viewing Full HD content. You need at least <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a> pixels, which the 24" have at <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1200">1920 x 1200</a>. Why does a LCD monitor need to be Full HD capable? I think there is a monitor and TV convergence happening due to the PC adding more media serving capabilities. The 24" LED-backlit LCD is based on Samsung's Super Patterned-ITO Vertical Alignment (S-PVA) technologies that provide 180-degree viewing angles, 250 cd/m2 of brightness, and greater than 1,000:1 contrast ratios. Finally, the 24" is eco-friendly as LEDs do not use mercury, a harmful substance used in most CCFLs used in backlights.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Just a comment about A4: In most of the world, the standard paper size is A4. Compared to the US standard of Letter, A4 is slightly longer. Of course, anything display that can display A4-sized information will have no problems displaying Letter-sized information.</p></p>
