<p>This announced at E3, the largest US entertainment conference held in LA. Too bad I&#39;m not there. The G35-AV650 is touted as being the first NBPC with an HD-DVD player inside. Now, to make use of all that HD goodness, Toshiba (smartly I might add) used a 1920*1200 pixel format 17" LCD instead of the usual 1440*900 non-sense. I wonder how nice HD-DVD content will look on that beautiful screen! Of course the 1080p content will not take up the entire screen since there is 120 extra horizontal lines, but overall, the small bars on the top and bottom should be small enough (60 lines) not to be noticed.
