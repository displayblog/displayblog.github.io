<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/30/5361646/google-sells-motorola-lenovo-failure-android-samsung-patents">Ben Popper, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/13/5305282/google-purchases-nest-for-3-2-billion">purchase of Nest indicates that Google</a> has rethought its hardware strategy, preferring to avoid competition with its Android partners and instead invest in the wide-open world of connected devices and smart homes instead. Larry Page said as much <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/29/heres-googles-internal-memo-on-motorolas-sale-to-lenovo/">in an email to staffers</a> about the Motorola sale. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;As a side note, this does not signal a larger shift for our other hardware efforts. The dynamics and maturity of the wearable and home markets, for example, are very different from that of the mobile industry. We&acirc;&euro;&trade;re excited by the opportunities to build amazing new products for users within these emerging ecosystems.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>Maturity?</p>
<p>Wearables and smart devices for the home are just getting started. When a whole bunch of companies, Google included, make a big mess of things in these two markets I'm betting Apple will come along and change it up just like Apple did with a messy MP3 market with the iPod, the crappy smartphone market with the iPhone, and the dying tablet market with the iPad.</p>
<p>That's what I thought before Google acquired Nest. Now I'm not so sure. But what I am sure of is I'm not going to buy possibly dead end products like the Nest Thermostat or Protect. According to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/29/nest-team-will-become-googles-core-hardware-group/">TechCrunch</a> the Nest team will &acirc;&euro;&oelig;still work on hardware devices, but not necessarily thermostats or smoke detectors.&acirc;&euro;</p>
