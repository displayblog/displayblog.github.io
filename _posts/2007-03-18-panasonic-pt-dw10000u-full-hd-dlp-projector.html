<p>Panasonic's PT-DW10000U is a three-chip DLP projector with a brightness of 10,000 lumens. Hence the model name! The DLP projector can display 1920 x 1200 pixels, which means Full HD 1080p video content will be not much of a problem. Except for the extra 60 lines on top and bottom: not much of a problem at all. Of course, given the 1920 x 1200 pixel format, this DLP projector is designed more for business use (connecting a PC) than viewing video. And you'll see later on this post why it will be just businesses that buy this.</p>

<p>Contrast ratio is a good 5,000:1 and the video is processed at 10-bit for more color fidelity. The industrial design is simple but not very sexy. If you are living in Arizona without air conditioning, don't worry. The PT-DW10000 can operate at up to 113 degrees thanks to its liquid-cooling system. There is also a Auto Cleaning Robot (inside?) that cleans the filters for up to 2,000 hours. You will be paying dearly for this as the MSRP is a mind boggling $74,999!
