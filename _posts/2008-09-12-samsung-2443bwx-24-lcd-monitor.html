<p>An interesting feature in the 2443BWX is that you can set a time for it to turn of automatically. So when you're working and you get distracted by the pizza delivery and forget about working the rest of the evening and fall asleep while watching reruns at 2am, you'll can have peace in the knowledge that you have not wasted a tremendous amount of energy due to a bright fully on <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=24"-lcd-monitor">24" LCD monitor</a>. That's an extreme example, but for IT managers, having the ability to turn off all 1000 monitors at exactly 8pm might make things a bit easier. Of course you'll piss off a few who are trying to get things done late in the evening.</p>
