<p><img src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Nexus_S_Contour_Display_Curved_Front_Glass_Panel-1.jpg" alt="" title="Nexus_S_Contour_Display_Curved_Front_Glass_Panel-1" width="480" height="44" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16220" /></p>
<p>This is the side view of the Super AMOLED display with the cover glass on top. The Contour Display is used in the Google Nexus S. Some think it's a big deal, but it really isn't.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Nexus-S-Teardown/4365/2">iFixit</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>You can definitely see that only the front glass panel is curved. The rest of the components are flat as a board, just as any other phone on the market.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Super AMOLED display itself isn't curved at all; it's flat. The contoured part is just the cover glass, unique but nothing to get excited about.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/nexus/features.html#">Google</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The curved glass screen fits comfortably in the palm of your hand and along the side of your face.</blockquote></p>
<p>Comfort in my hand or along the side of my face is not high on the list of things I look for in a smartphone. When I go to the Apple Store I don't stick the iPhone to the side of my face and think, "Wow, this thing is really comfortable!"</p>
<p>Here are some of the things I <em>do</em> look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Industrial design: Simple lines and shapes. Materials that exude quality.</li>
<li>Size: Not too big, not too small. Needs to fit in my hands.</li>
<li>Weight: Can't be too heavy, but it also shouldn't be too light.</li>
<li>Buttons: I like physical buttons and for them to feel a certain way. There needs to be a certain tension and I listen for a certain type of sound.</li>
<li>Display: It has to look brilliant. But not only that the multitouch response needs to be instantaneous.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Choice material on Google Nexus S? Plastic. Here's the bottom line: the Contour Display on the Google Nexus S is unique, but ultimately a useless, unwanted feature. Maybe next time Samsung and Google can concentrate more on the things that matter.</p>
