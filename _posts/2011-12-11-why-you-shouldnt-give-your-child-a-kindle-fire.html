<p><a href="http://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/Amazon-Kindle-Fire-lets-kids-rsg-3752604696.html">Mitch Lipka, Reuters</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>St. Louis area software engineer Lance Durham says he decided to get a couple of Kindle Fires to give as presents to his children. He was loading some games before wrapping them and realized he couldn't turn off the single-click ordering, which charges his credit card.</p>
<p>"There was no password or pin, nor any kind of confirmation - the purchase immediately went through," he says.</p>
<p>So Durham called Amazon and says he was told the ordering from Amazon could not be disabled, and the company suggested he "deregister" the device after every purchase. That, he says, caused the downloaded apps to stop working.</p>
<p>He returned the tablets.</blockquote></p>
<p>Unless your child has been blessed with a level of self control most adults only aspire to, I would recommend holding off giving your child a Kindle Fire until Amazon fixes this problem.</p>
