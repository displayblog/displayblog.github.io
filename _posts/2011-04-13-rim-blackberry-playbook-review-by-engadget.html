<p>Tim Stevens at <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/04/13/blackberry-playbook-review/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A five megapixel camera peeks out the back, while a three megapixel unit handles front-facing duties. That one is tucked under the glass and situated just above the seven-inch, 1,024 x 600 display that will threaten neither rods nor cones when on maximum brightness. It does, however, deliver great clarity and excellent viewing angles.</blockquote></p>
<p>I would have thought there'd be a bit more about the display on the PlayBook since the single most important success factor for a tablet, in my humble opinion, is the display. The 1024x600 pixel format on the 7-inch PlayBook is weak. Yes, I know even the mighty Samsung Galaxy Tab has the same number of pixels, and the king of tablets, the iPad, doesn't have much more. But, can't we move beyond 1024x600 to something like 1280x720 on a 7-inch? For some 1:1 720p HD goodness? I'm sure it's possible, but I'm not sure why no one's coming out with one. The PlayBook is on-par in terms of resolution with the rest.</p>
<p>I guess Stevens is trying to say that brightness isn't all that bright on the PlayBook? If so, like all other LCD-based tablets, playing out in the sun isn't in the books (I try). But what does "great clarity" mean? Don't all LCDs have clarity? And then viewing angles: what is considered excellent? And what about touch/multitouch responsiveness?</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see for someone else to do a more thorough review on the PlayBook's most important asset: the display. To summarize it seems the display on the PlayBook is: not bad.</p>
