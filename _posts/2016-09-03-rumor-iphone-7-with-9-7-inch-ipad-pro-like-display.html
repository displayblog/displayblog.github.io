<p>[ <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2016/09/03/kgi-iphone-7-to-feature-2-4ghz-a10-chip-ipx7-waterproofing-new-12-megapixel-cameras-piano-black-color-more/">9to5Mac</a> ] KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo is speculating the upcoming iPhone 7 will sport the same sizes -- 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch -- but with a display like that of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. The 9.7-inch iPad Pro had two distinct features: a wider color gamut and what Apple calls True Tone. This is <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/">what Apple says</a>&nbsp;about 9.7-inch iPad Pro's wider color gamut display:</p>
<blockquote><p>The 9.7-inch iPad Pro display uses the same color space as the digital cinema industry. This wider color gamut gives iPad Pro up to 25 percent greater color saturation than previous iPad models. So colors are more vivid, true to life, and engaging.</blockquote><br />
Greater color saturation is not always a good thing, especially when the colors are more saturated than what is seen in nature, a problem -- called oversaturation -- most OLED displays had in their infancy. Many Samsung smartphones with OLED displays still have oversaturated colors the default setting. If you own one my recommendation is to change the display setting called Screen Mode from AMOLED Photo or AMOLED Cinema to Basic Screen Mode. I've found Basic Screen Mode to provide the most accurate colors. From what Apple has done with color accuracy on the iPhone I don't think we'll see a display that oversaturates colors. But I do hope we'll see a way to color calibrate the display. Unlikely yes, but a guy can wish. And what's a True Tone display?</p>
<blockquote><p>It uses advanced four-channel ambient light sensors to automatically adapt the color and intensity of the display to match the light in your environment. Which means reading is more natural and comfortable &mdash; almost like looking at a sheet of paper.</blockquote><br />
By figuring out the brightness and color of the environment the iPad's True Tone feature&nbsp;adjusts the brightness and color of the display to match the environment making it a lot easier on your eyes. This is a great feature and I'm glad it's coming to the iPhone.</p>
<p><em>Update 2016.09.07:&nbsp;</em>Wide color gamut display on the iPhone 7 is confirmed.</p>
