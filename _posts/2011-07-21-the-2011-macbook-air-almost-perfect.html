<blockquote><p>Without a doubt, the MacBook Air is Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s best notebook computer. Its design has no equal in the world. Even people who couldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t care less about technology will be in awe of its beauty, and with its improved innards, the MacBook Air can handle some serious computing action.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote><p>For the past 9 months, the Air has been the computer I take with me everywhere. I previously didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t like the Air line because I felt it was underpowered and overpriced &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; both of those things changed with last year&acirc;&euro;&trade;s revamp. Today&acirc;&euro;&trade;s upgrades should make it even more attractive to would-be purchasers. With just the right combination of portability and power, it is hands-down the best computer I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve ever owned.</blockquote></p>
<p>Sounds good. But those damned thick bezels.</p>
