<p><a href="http://allthingsd.com/20111027/big-cable-loses-more-subscribers-still-says-it-isnt-seeing-cord-cutting/">Peter Kafka, AllThingsD</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pay attention to the parenthetical numbers, which denote subscriber losses. The two to focus on are the video subscribers &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; down 128,000 for the quarter &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; and the total subscribers &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; down 16,000.</blockquote></p>
<p>Those are "Residential Video" net declines. Business Video, whatever that is, posted a two thousand net addition. I've cut the TV cord a long time ago and have been saving hundreds every year since. All my TV viewing has been on Hulu.</p>
