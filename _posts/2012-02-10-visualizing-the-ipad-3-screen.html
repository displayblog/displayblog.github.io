<blockquote><p>This will present problems for developers and designers of iPad apps unless Apple also releases a new display with either a higher resolution or a HiDPI mode. Otherwise we will no longer be able to view 1:1 mockups or run the simulator at full size without clipping part of the view.</blockquote></p>
<p>A very good point, but I think the iPad 3 will become the most popular device to develop Retina-class apps for the iPad 3.</p>
