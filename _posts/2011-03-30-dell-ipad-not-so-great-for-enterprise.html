<p>Andy Lark, global head of marketing for large enterprises and public organizations at Dell, <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.cio.com.au/article/381337/apple_ipad_will_fail_enterprise_dell/">CIO</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I couldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be happier that Apple has created a market and built up enthusiasm but longer term, open, capable and affordable will win, not closed, high price and proprietary. [Apple has] done a really nice job, they&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve got a great product, but the challenge they&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve got is that already Android is outpacing them. Apple is great if you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve got a lot of money and live on an island. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not so great if you have to exist in a diverse, open, connected enterprise; simple things become quite complex.</blockquote></p>
<p>According to Justin Williams at <a href="http://carpeaqua.com/2011/03/29/an-updated-list-of-android-apps-for-honeycomb/">carpeaqua</a> the total number of apps for Google's Honeycomb tablet operating system is 20. Not 20 thousand, just one more than 19.</p>
<p>Open? According to James Cushing at <a href="http://thegadgets.net/technology-news/google-holding-onto-android-honeycomb-source-code-indefinitely/">The Gadgets</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>To the dismay of Android developers everywhere, Google&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Android team has announced that they will withhold the tablet OS Honeycomb&acirc;&euro;&trade;s, source code for an indefinite period of time.</blockquote></p>
<p>I wouldn't consider that open, would you? Enterprise? Here's what John Paczkowski at <a href="http://digitaldaily.allthingsd.com/20110214/its-business-time-for-apples-ipad/?mod=ATD_skybox">All Things Digital</a> has to say about the iPad and the enterprise:</p>
<blockquote><p>Though there&acirc;&euro;&trade;s no dedicated salesforce selling it in the enterprise market, Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s iPad has gained significant traction there. Since its debut, more than 65 percent of the Fortune 100 have deployed or piloted the device. This despite Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s continued focus on the consumer market.</blockquote></p>
<p>That's 65 Fortune 100 companies, which I would guess have complex needs. Simple things don't become quite complex; non-focused decision-making folks make simple things quite complex. Simple things are simply simple things, and the iPad is simple. So I take it Dell doesn't want to sell to folks with a lot of money who live on islands?</p>
