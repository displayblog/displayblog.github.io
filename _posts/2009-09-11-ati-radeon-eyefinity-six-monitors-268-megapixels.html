<p><a href="http://hothardware.com/News/AMD-Eyefinity-MultiDisplay-Technology-In-Action/">Hot Hardware</a>, <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13924_3-10350261-64.html?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=2547-1_3-0-5">cnet</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/09/11/video-ati-radeon-eyefinity-eyes-on-featuring-left-4-dead-on-a/">Engadget</a>: That's Codemaster's GRID being played by a really lucky guy on 6 LCD monitors.&Acirc;&nbsp;ATI's Radeon Eyefinity lets you connect up to 6 displays with a single graphics card via DisplayPort, DVI, HDMI, etc. The GPU running the show is based on 40nm technology, features 2 billion transistors and has the capacity for 2.5 trillion calculations per second.</p>
<p>You can configure the 6 displays as one massive screen or 6 individual ones. By connecting six 30-inch monitors in a 3 x 2 matrix you get a resolution of 7680 x 3200 for a total of 24.576 megapixels. The maximum capability of the Eyefinity is 268 megapixels.</p>
<p>Acer, Dell, HP, MSI and Toshiba are already working on equipping Eyefinity into their notebooks. CrossFire support will be coming in the future but will require at least a single DisplayPort connection. I guess DisplayPort is the future at least if you want an ATI multi-monitor solution.&Acirc;&nbsp;According to AMD, Eyefinity approaches eye-definition optical clarity that seem optically real to the human eye. All looks good, but there is one glaring problem.</p>
<p>If you look at the awesome 3 x 2 setup in the picture at the beginning of this post, the two vertical bezels in the middle make for a not-so-seamless look. This must change for the better if we expect multiple monitor setups to work as a single display. Can we move to a bezel-free display in the near future? Samsung seems to think so.</p>
<p>During <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/09/01/notes-2009-displaysearch-digital-signage-conference/">DisplaySearch's Digital Signage Conference 2009</a> that was held in San Jose, CA, the company promised zero bezel LCDs in the future. <em>Thanks Paul for the tip!</em></p>
