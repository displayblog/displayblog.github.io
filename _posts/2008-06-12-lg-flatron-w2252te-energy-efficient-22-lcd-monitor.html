<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lg">LG</a> claims that its Flatron W2252TE is the world's most energy efficient 22" <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-monitor">LCD monitor</a>. This is a good trend: being more energy efficient means it is better. The W2252TE consumes 40W, which is 45% less than other 22" LCD monitors. If every other electronic gadget consumed 45% less that would be remarkable!</p>
<p>Other specifications are pretty standard except for the extremely high contrast ratio of 10,000:1. I am guessing that this is <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dynamic-contrast">dynamic contrast</a> and uses some type of brightness modulation of the CCFL-based backlight unit (BLU). The other noticeable specification is that the brightness is at just 250 cd/m2. Most 22" LCD monitors are rated around 300 cd/m2 so there was some performance cutting there to save a bit of energy. As long as the lower brightness does not impact the usability of the W2252TE, I think having a bit less is moving in the right direction.</p>
