<p>Tim Stevens at <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/02/droid-charge-review/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The buttons may be a bit dim, but there are no issues with brightness on that display, which again is 4.3-inches of Super AMOLED Plus goodness. Resolution is not jaw-dropping at 800 x 480, though the contrast is. Blacks are, naturally, perfectly black and the brights are borderline blinding in a darkened room, while viewing angles are unlimited. Even outdoors in the screen is quite readable. We had no problem composing shots when the sun finally broke through the clouds and lit up our weekend. </p>
<p>However, color reproduction can leave a bit to be desired. On the default, automatic-brightness settings, white sections of the display instead fall toward green. Remove that toggle, dial up the brightness and you get far more pure shades -- just make sure you squint a little before popping on the display in a dimly-lit area. The color-tweaking feature found on the Galaxy S II? Sadly not here, though the display is still mighty impressive even without.</blockquote></p>
<p>Without having had the pleasure of playing around with a smartphone equipped with a Super AMOLED Plus display, I imagine the display would pose some problems in direct sunlight unlike what Stevens experienced. The "color-tweaking feature" is called Background Effect, which allows you to con&Acirc;&shy;trol sat&Acirc;&shy;u&Acirc;&shy;ra&Acirc;&shy;tion levels, and found in the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/04/28/samsung-galaxy-s-ii-review/">Samsung Galaxy S II</a>. The 4.3-inch Super AMOLED Plus display by Samsung looks like it competes quite well against the 3.5-inch IPS-based Retina Display used in the iPhone 4.</p>
