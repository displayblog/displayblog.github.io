  the motion blur performance with moving test patterns was much worse than what&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
  claimed in the manufacturer&acirc;&euro;&trade;s specifications, the motion blur
  performance during the extensive viewing tests with a wide range of live video content
  viewed simultaneously on a large number of HDTVs surprised us by turning out much
  better than expected. Motion blur proved to be a non-issue for live video in all
  of the mid to high-end LCDs in our tests.</blockquote>\r\n<strong>Motion Blur
  Non-Issue</strong> That is the conclusion from Dr. Raymond M. Soneira, President,
  DisplayMate Technologies Corporation. Dr. Soneira also states that methods to improve
  the response time of liquid crystals only introduce artifacts into the images or
  \"just ineffective marketing gimmicks\". These methods include: overdriving circuitry,
  edge enhancement, and <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=120hz&amp;sa=Search#1379\">120Hz</a>
  or faster frequencies. One of the main specifications that indicate whether or not
  a LCD TV will do well with motion blur is response time. When looking at response
  time the most important consideration is a low gray-to-gray (GTG) response and not
  the typical black-to-peak-white-to-black response time. The LCD TVs that were tested
  include: Samsung LN-T5281F , Sharp LC-52D92U, Sony KDL-52XBR4.\r\n\r\n<strong>Test</strong>
  Evaluating motion blur starts from using a specialized moving test pattern, moving
  photographs and live video. Moving test patterns and photographs were generated
  by <a href=\"http://www.displaymate.com/db/infodmmb.html\">DisplayMate
  Multimedia with Motion Bitmaps Edition</a>, which includes 25 proprietary motion
  test patterns and 35 test photos. A Nikon D90 DSLR was used to photograph these
  moving test patterns and photographs with a shutter speed of 1/160th a second. "

<p><strong>No Detectable Motion Blur</strong> While watching extensive live video content on all the LCD TVs, all of the participants saw no visually detectable motion blur! Some thought they saw motion blur but the blur was either in the source video or were a temporary visual illusion. How can this be when we 'know' that LCD TVs have motion blur problems? Here's the answer from Dr. Soneira:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unlike the moving test patterns and moving photographs, the eye is unable to detect the blur in live video because the images are much more dynamic and complex, and undoubtedly because of the way the brain processes and extracts essential information from visual images. The results were identical for all of the LCD HDTVs, regardless of whether they had 60 or 120 Hz refresh rates, strobed LED backlighting, or advanced motion enhancement processing.</blockquote><br />
<strong>Save Your Money</strong> Response time is not an accurate indicator of the LCD TV's performance regarding motion blur. What Dr. Soneira found was that the exact opposite was true: the LCD TVs with the shortest response times had the greatest motion blur on moving test patterns and moving photographs. And don't spend the extra money on fancy anti-motion blur technologies such as 120Hz (or faster), strobe <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=led+backlight&amp;sa=Search#1348">LED backlighting</a>, motion enhancement processing, etc.: there were no visually detectable difference in motion blur performance among mid- to high-end LCD TVs that he tested.
