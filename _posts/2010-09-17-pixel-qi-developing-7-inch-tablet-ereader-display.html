<blockquote><p>We are developing a 7&acirc;&euro;¬ù screen for tablets and ereaders that is planned for mass production in H1 2011. Samples will be available earlier, perhaps by late Q4 2010. Contact us to be an early access partner: send email to admin@pixelqi.com</blockquote></p>
<p>The next Samsung Tab with a 7-inch Pixel Qi display is a very interesting possibility.</p>
