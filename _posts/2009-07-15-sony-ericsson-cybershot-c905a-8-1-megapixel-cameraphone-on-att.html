<p><img class="size-full wp-image-6477 aligncenter" title="Sony_Ericsson_C905a" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Sony_Ericsson_C905a.jpg" alt="Sony_Ericsson_C905a" width="500" height="260" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/07/sony-ericsson-brings-81-mp-camera-phone-to-att/">Wired</a>: The Sony Ericsson Cybershot C905a will be the highest resolution cameraphone on AT&amp;T with 8.1 megapixels. Of course, you and I know better to think that picture quality is higher just because there are more pixels. It is often the opposite. We'll see when reviews come in. Specs for the C905a's camera: face detection, autofocus, Xenon flash, GPS tagging. I would like to see more companies move toward high ISO image sensors rather than adding a flash. The reason being that using flash generally makes for less-than-ideal pictures. My moto when it comes to photography is to use, whenever possible, natural light. But that's just me.</p>
<p>According to Michael Woodward, vice president at AT&amp;T mobility, the C905a is "the best camera available in a mobile phone today..." I'm not sure if Woodward's claim has any merit; I'll let the professional reviewers to tell me whether the C905a is the best or not. But I'm inclined to believe that the C905a's picture-taking abilities will be pretty good.</p>
<p>The 2.4-inch scratch-resistant LCD on the C905a looks to be slightly on the small side. For a quick comparison the iPhone has a 3.5-inch scratch-resistant LCD. The resolution is 240 x 320 (portrait), which is on the low side. Again, to compare, the iPhone has 320 x 480, twice as more. Even if the C905a takes great pictures, I have a feeling the experience will be less than spectacular thanks to the small and low-resolution LCD. And I guess Sony will never learn. Just throw away Memory Stick and 'stick' to SD. Is it that hard to internally kill Memory Stick?</p>
<p>US$230: That's the price of the C905a out the door. You do get a $50 mail-in-rebate in the form of a AT&amp;T promotion card, whatever that means. Just sell the C905a for $199 and trust me AT&amp;T you'll get more sales. Of course, with a $99 iPhone 3G right next to it, I'm not sure how much more you'll sell even at $149.</p>
