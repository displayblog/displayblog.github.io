<p>Do you use Zinio? If not, you should. Zinio is software that allows you to read magazines on your computer display. If you have a high-enough resolution monitor the experience of reading a magazine using Zinio is pretty darn amazing. There are many cool features but I'll touch on just a few.</p>
<p><strong>Staples</strong> Do you get frustrated when a nice 2-page picture spread is mired by those three staples right in the middle? With Zinio, as you might have guessed already, the 2-page or even a 3-page spread looks wonderful with no staples.</p>
<p><strong>Hyperlinks</strong> Most of the time I read my favorite magazines cover to cover. But from time to time I like to get to the cover story. With some magazines ads make up a good portion and finding the page numbers can get tedious. With Zinio simply go to the table of contents and click on the cover story and it flips (there is animation) that gets you there in no time.</p>
<p><strong>Zoom</strong> Some of you might not have perfect vision. Heck, without my glasses I'm as good as blind! So you'll be glad to know there is a zoom feature that makes tiny text very large and very readable.</p>
<p>If you haven't already, <a href="http://www.zinio.com/">check out Zinio</a>, I think you'll like it.</p>
<p><strong>Hardware</strong> Now, with all that said, let's get to the subject matter: Zinio hardware. Wouldn't it be nice if there was a electronic reader that has full color, touchable, is fast and works like Zinio does?</p>
<p><strong>Black and White</strong> Amazon's Kindle is nice, but it is black and white. Even textbooks have moved on to color. Ditto newspapers (some, not all). And forget about trying to enjoy a magazine on your Kindle. Let's demand that our displays be in color since most of us are designed to see in color.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> What's the resolution on the Kindle? Whatever it is it isn't enough. I would like to have resolution increase quite a bit so fonts are smooth--like the ones you see on magazines and newspapers--even when zoomed in. The increase in resolution wouldn't make only fonts look better it will make images and pictures look a whole lot better too.</p>
<p>Anyone know if someone is working on something like this?</p>
