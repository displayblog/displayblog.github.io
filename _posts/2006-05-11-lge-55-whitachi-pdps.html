<p>A lot of LG-related news today. CEO Ssang-Soo Kim announced on May 8 that LGE's 55" PDP TVs that use Hitachi PDPs (panels) will be hitting the local (Korean) market very soon in mid-May. Samsung, LG's main competitor in Korea and the world over, has three competitive sizes for PDP TVs: 50", 55" and 63". LG has 50" and 60" and had to fill the gap. The fastest way was to buy from a PDP merchant and came Hitachi with a solution. Source: <a href="http://www.fpdisplay.com/News_Info/Shtml/20060511_11325.htm" target="_blank">FPDisplay.com</a></p>
