<p>Mike Isaac at <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/03/att-crippled-4g/">Wired</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>After Texas resident Keith Geissler noticed his new Motorola Atrix wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t offering the fast &acirc;&euro;&oelig;4G&acirc;&euro; download and upload speeds that AT&T promised, he filed a complaint to the Better Business Bureau, asking the wireless company to &acirc;&euro;&oelig;uncap&acirc;&euro; his data connection.</p>
<p>AT&T&acirc;&euro;&trade;s response was surprising. While the company assured Geissler it &acirc;&euro;&oelig;has not capped the upload speeds on the Atrix,&acirc;&euro; it did admit that the phone&acirc;&euro;&trade;s HSUPA capability &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; a key feature in increasing upload speeds on the Atrix as well as the new HTC Inspire 4G smartphone &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; will not be enabled until a later date.</blockquote></p>
<p>AT&T markets the Motorola Atrix and the HTC Inspire 4G as 4G smartphones. The problem is that 4G hasn't been turned on on AT&T's network. When will it happen? Some time in April. So what do you call a business tactic that says you'll get one thing and then delivers something else? Fraud.</p>
