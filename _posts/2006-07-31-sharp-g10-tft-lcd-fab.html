<p>Sharp is considering investing toward a G10 TFT LCD fab. The G10 fab would cost roughly 500 billion yen (or US$4.3 billion) and if Sharp goes ahead with its plan, construction will start in the third quarter of 2007 and about 9 months to a year later will hit mass production around mid-2008. The glass size would be 2,850mm x 3,050mm and would focus on 57" (eight cuts) and 65" (six cuts) LCD TV panels.</p>
<p>That is a lot of money to invest toward a market segment (57"-65") that is really tiny. Of course, it is tiny now, but maybe would be large enough in 2009 to justify a US$4+ billion investment. The possibility of a 65" LCD TV with Full HD resolution (1920 x 1080) powered by a LED lightsource for $1999 is tempting indeed. Maybe we can expect resolutions to go higher than 1920 x 1080, something like Apple's 30" LCD monitor's resolution at 2560 x 1600.</p>
<p>When Sharp and other LCD manufacturers like LG.Philips LCD (LPL) and Samsung get into producing 60"-class LCD TVs on their G10 fabs around 2008, I have to wonder how plasma TVs will compete. You still do not have a 1920 x 1080 native pixel resolution plasma TV at the 42" size.</p>
