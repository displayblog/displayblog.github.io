<blockquote><p>Sales of Apple hardware may be contributing quite a bit to Softbank&acirc;&euro;&trade;s bottom line, but it also helps by increasing the average revenue per user (ARPU) for Softbank customers. Data ARPU climbed to a record high &Acirc;&yen;2,440 per subscriber per month on average, putting it first overall in the world among mobile operators when it comes to the ratio of data to traditional cellular services ARPU.</blockquote><br />
