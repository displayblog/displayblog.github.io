<blockquote><p>... the image it produced was dynamic, engaging and detailed up to around 60 inches...</p>
<p>In a darkened room, colours were vibrant but not too oversaturated, with fairly realistic skin tones and natural greens. A slight lack of sharpness due to the low resolution and relatively unsophisticated lens might even be considered to add to the cinematic feel. What's especially impressive is that, with lamp brightness set to normal and when projecting on a decent surface, blacks are black and dark detailing is surprisingly good, revealing detail that's lost on many TN-based LCD screens...</blockquote></p>
<p>Sixty inches, but filled with just 854x480 pixels. Still, coming out of a 7x7cm box is impressive. Contrast is very good at 1000:1 and the DLP-based pico-projector uses LED technology that pumps out 30 lumens. The Samsung H03 pico-projector is priced around US$300.</p>
