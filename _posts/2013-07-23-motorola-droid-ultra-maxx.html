<p>Nathan Ingraham, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/23/4548984/verizon-and-motorola-introduce-the-heavily-leaked-droid-ultra-and">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As for the displays, both devices feature 5-inch, 720p screens. We're a little disappointed with the resolution at that size, but on the plus side both screens use OLED technology and do <em>not</em> include the Pentile sub-pixel arrangement found on previous Droid RAZR devices.</blockquote></p>
<p>RGB OLED displays is definitely a move in the right direction. Unfortunately the 1280x720 pixel format is not competitive with other high end smartphones such as the 4.7-inch 1920x1080 HTC One. But that doesn't mean the OLED display is not good in terms of resolution; the Droid Ultra sports a resolution of about 294 ppi, which will provide a retina display experience for most. Resolution isn't everything so we will have to wait and see what <a href="http://displaymate.com/mobile.html">Raymond Soneira</a> says about the Droid Ultra's OLED display to know for sure.</p>
