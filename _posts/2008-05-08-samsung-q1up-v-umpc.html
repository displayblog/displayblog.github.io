<p>It is amazing that the Samsung Q1UP-V <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=umpc">UMPC</a> comes loaded with Microsoft's Vista Business OS. Even fairly powerful desktop computers have been known to have problems running Vista Business at decent enough speeds to not want to downgrade to Windows XP Pro. We'll see when reviews come in how well the Q1UP-V tames Vista Business. My guess is that it won't very well.</p>
<p>The display is a 7" LCD with a pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=%221024+x+600%22">1024 x 600</a>. The LCD has a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=%22led+backlight%22">LED backlight</a> that should elongate how long you play with the Q1UP-V before the battery gets exhausted. The 1024 horizontal pixels is a great move by Samsung. If one of the main purposes of a high-tech gadget is surfing the Internet, it must have 1024 horizontal pixels. Why? Because most all websites, correctly or incorrectly, are designed for a 1024 horizontal pixel screen. Web surfing should be pretty smooth with this display, as long as you're not using Internet Explorer. All of the specifications point to a decent machine.</p>
<p>But the biggest question that I have for something like this is: How do you carry it? I don't think it is small enough to put in your pant pocket. I think you'll even have problems in cargo pants: when you have a fairly large and heavy object in that cargo pocket, it tends to rock back and forth and makes you look really ridiculous. I've heard that folks in Asia and in Europe use man bags to tote their wallet, mobile phone and one of these slightly larger tech gadgets. But there's just one problem. Aside from San Francisco and pockets of areas where mostly immigrants live, it is difficult to say the least to use a man bag. Seinfeld has tried it and failed. What makes me think I can succeed? I actually have two man bags, but I use them when I travel to Asia because they are indeed very convenient. But in San Jose? I don't think so. So... the Q1UP-V might see some success with regions that have an acceptable way of carrying them: Western Europe and Asia. I would like to carry a powerful Internet surfing <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=umpc">UMPC</a> but it just isn't acceptable via a man bag in the US. I'll just stick to my <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=iphone">iPhone</a> for now.</p>
