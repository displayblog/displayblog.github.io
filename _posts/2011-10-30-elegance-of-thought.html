<blockquote>
<p>The American space program discovered that normal ink pens didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t work on missions (no gravity in orbit to pull down the ink), so they spent millions to research and develop a pen that could write upside down. The Russians, the story goes, brought a pack of pencils.</p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>The upside down million dollar pen is like a standing-height desk with small motors to adjust the height for standing or sitting. The 'Russian' solution: "a bar-height table and a stool."</p></p>
