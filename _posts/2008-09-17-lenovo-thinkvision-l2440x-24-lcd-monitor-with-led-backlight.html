<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/09/17/lenovo-rolls-out-bundle-of-new-enviro-minded-thinkvision-monitor/">Engadget</a>: Most likely Lenovo's ThinkVision L2440x sports a S-PVA TFT LCD panel, similar to its brethren the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2007/09/20/lenovo-thinkvision-l220x-22-wuxga-lcd-monitor/">ThinkVision L220x</a>, but it's just a guess. What is quite different from the L220x (aside from the obvious difference in size) and virtually all other LCD monitors is that the L2440x sports a LED backlight. This trend will only continue and I think it is a good trend as it reduces power consumption, eliminates the introduction of Mercury in the production process (thus eliminating it from being reintroduced into the environment as waste) and is generally more rugged and will last longer than the typical CCFL-based backlight. For $749.99, the L2240x is a bargain.</p>
