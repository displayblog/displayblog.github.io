<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=chi-mei-optoelectronics">Chi Mei Optoelectronics</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=cmo">CMO</a>) is the second largest <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-manufacturer">LCD manufacturer</a> in Taiwan and just announced that its November LCD fab utilization rate dropped to below 60%. Normal levels are high 80s. CMO is only taking orders with price quotes that are above its manufacturing cash cost levels. Jau-Yang Ho, President of CMO, indicated that the company will not be suspending any LCD fabs even though utilization rates have dropped considerably. Biing-Seng Wu, Executive VP of CMO, calmed fears of a plant shut down by stating that even if the company had to shut down a LCD fab it is easy to resume operations with normal levels of production and yield within just a week. International exchange rates are not helping either. While Korea's won depreciated against the US dollar by 60%, the Taiwan dollar dropped just 3% making it very difficult to compete against <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=samsung">Samsung</a> and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lg-display">LG Display</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=au-optronics">AU Optronics</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=auo">AUO</a>) and CMO have traditionally competed on price against competitors such as LG Display, Samsung, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sharp">Sharp</a> and others. With a price disadvantage and without a significant technology advantage, the two largest Taiwan-based LCD manufacturers will have difficulty getting into LCD programs from major brands, who in turn are looking for lower LCD costs in light of rapidly declining demand for both <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-monitor">LCD monitor</a>s and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a>s. Although <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=notebook-pc">notebook PC</a> demand has been strong there are indicators that demand is slowing.</p>
