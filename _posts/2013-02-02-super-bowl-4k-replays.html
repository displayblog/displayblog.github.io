<p>CBS and For-A worked with Evertz to develop DreamCatcher. This is what DreamCatcher can do according to David Pierce, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/2/3943312/super-bowl-4k-is-a-game-changer">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[...] lets the production crew immediately tap into the 4K footage to get larger, more detailed replays than a 1080p camera offers. With four times the pixels comes much-improved clarity, and a 1920 x 1080 cross-section of the image is going to be far sharper than the blurry replays we're used to seeing.</blockquote></p>
<p>Imagine the Olympics, the World Cup, the NBA, the MLB, etc. using 4K video analysis technology. 4K is sooner than later.</p>
