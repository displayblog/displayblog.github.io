<p>Dr. Manish Sharma, professor IIT Delhi:</p>
<blockquote><p>IPS LCD&acirc;&euro;&trade;s have won unanimous favour of professionals because of dynamic definition and is the most precise technology for color reducibility as the pure black layer is much clearer giving you a perfect color resolution. IPS has features realizing wide viewing angle and rapid response time which enables clear display of vivid, realistic images in action intensive sports, and high speed gaming. Hence, this makes IPS the most suited technology for home usage as well as for the professional sector.</blockquote></p>
