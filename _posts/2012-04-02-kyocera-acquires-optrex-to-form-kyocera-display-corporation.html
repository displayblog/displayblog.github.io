<p><a href="http://www.kyocera-display.com/pdf/Optrex_Acquisition_12-28-11.pdf">Kyocera Display (PDF)</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>OPTREX Corporation ("OPTREX") was acquired and has been held and managed by Japan Industrial Partners, Inc. ("JIP") since February, 2008. Prior to 2008, Optrex was a wholly owned subsidiary of Asahi Glass Co., Ltd. and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation. We are pleased to advise that JIP and the investors have reached an agreement on a sale of all their shareholdings to KYOCERA Corporation effective December 22nd 2011. The transfer of the shares is scheduled to be completed in February 2012. After closing, OPTREX will continue to execute and expand its broad range of business as a subsidiary of KYOCERA, leveraging the current business base.</blockquote></p>
<p>Optrex America is now Kyocera Display America; Optrex Europe is now Kyocera Display Europe; and Optrex's touch screen boding capabilities will complement Kyocera's resistive and capacitive touch panels.</p>
