<p>On April 16, Asustek Computer released the new Eee PC 900. The Eee PC 900 comes loaded with Windows XP or Linux, your choice and is an updated version of previous Eee PCs that have provided an excellent option for those who desire an ultra-portable <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=notebook">notebook</a> PC that does not break the bank. Asus launched the Eee PC in 2007 and the Eee PC 4G garnered substantial praise among users and the press. By trimming down the notebook PC to only the basics and allowing a full-blown OS to be used and topping it off with a great price, the Eee PC was born to succeed in a marketplace that was crowded with really expensive portable devices.</p>
<p>A special feature of the Eee PC 900 is the multi-touch FingerGlide trackpad that allows you to scroll left/right and up/down by using two fingers, just like you do with the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=%22macbook+air%22">MacBook Air</a> and updated <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=%22macbook+pro%22">MacBook Pro</a> notebook PCs from Apple.</p>
<p>The 8.9" LCD has a pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=%221024+x+600%22">1024 x 600</a> and has a built-in 1.3MP webcam. The 1024 pixels greatly improve the Internet browsing experience as most websites are developed with the assumption that the display has at least 1024 horizontal pixels. The previous version was limited to just 800 horizontal pixels and required the users to scroll left and right a considerable amount. The additional 1.9" on the LCD improves the viewing experience significantly as well. Trusted Reviews is also noting that the LCD quality on the new Eee PC 900 is "superb" with uniform light, no dead pixels and a generally good viewing angle. The bezel around the LCD has been reduced from the previous version but could use additional trimming in my opinion as my <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=17">17"</a> Dell notebook PC has a bezel that is just as thin. <a href="http://www.trustedreviews.com/notebooks/review/2008/04/16/Asus-Eee-PC-900/p1">Trusted Reviews</a> has an excellent overall review of the new Asus Eee PC 900.</p>
