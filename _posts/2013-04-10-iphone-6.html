<blockquote><p>More important, tacking an S onto the existing model number sends a rather weak message. It says that this is our &acirc;&euro;&oelig;off-year&acirc;&euro; product, with only modest improvements. If holding off on the big number change achieved some great result, I might think otherwise. But look what happened with iPhone 5.</p>
<p>This model brought major changes: bigger screen, better camera, greater speed, all on a thinner and lighter body. Yet its improvements were still dismissed by many as &acirc;&euro;&oelig;incremental.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>

<blockquote><p>I agree: if Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s going to keep using sequential numbers (rather than feature-based names, like the second iPhone being named &acirc;&euro;&oelig;iPhone 3G&acirc;&euro;), they should just give every model the next number. The next iPhone should either be the iPhone 6 or the iPhone Something Else, not the iPhone 5S.</blockquote></p>
<p>I agree with Segal that tacking on an S is no good, but I disagree the next iPhone should be called iPhone 6. To get away from both the perception of incremental improvements and confusion as to what the numbers after iPhone mean Apple should completely do away with suffixes on the iPhone. The next iPhone and the one after that and the one after that ad infinitum should simply be iPhone.</p>
