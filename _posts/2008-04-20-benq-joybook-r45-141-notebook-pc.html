<p>This BenQ notebook PC is certainly a handsome unit. The 14.1" wide LCD with a pixel format of 1280 x 800 is of standard fare. As far as I can see it is not a LED backlit LCD. The focus on this unit might be more style as the R45 sports a brown faux leather panel covering the lid.</p>

<p>I believe it takes more than just replacing part of the lid with fake leather to bring IT products such as a notebook PC a step closer to becoming, in the mind of the owner, more like a leather wallet or leather briefcase. This is a major tangent to this article, but if leather was the choice of material for an electronic device, I would think it would need to take advantages of its features: flexible, generally soft to the touch, and durable. Something that complements leather on the other side of it might be a rollable display technology. In my opinion, I think that might work quite a bit better.</p>
