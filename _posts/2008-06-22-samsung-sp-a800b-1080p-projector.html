<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=samsung">Samsung</a> announced during <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=infocomm-2008">InfoComm 2008</a> that its SP-A800B 1080p front <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=front-projection">projector</a> is now available for purchase throughout the US. Chris Franey, VP of Marketing and Commercial Sales, was very pleased that <a href="http://review.zdnet.com/home-theater-projectors/samsung-sp-a800b/4505-7858_16-33057398.html">C|NET gave the SP-A800B a 9 out of 10</a>, which is one of the best ratings for any product and is given very infrequently. Simply put the SP-A800B had a dual combination of excellent scaling and lens that resulted in images with very high resolution.</p>
<p>Here's a quote from the C|NET review:</p>
<blockquote><p>This [Blu-ray disk of <em>The Departed</em>] also showed off the SP-A800B's 1080p resolution unmarred because of its competent scaling, and preserved by an excellent lens, both of which are common problems that rob a significant amount of resolution from many of the competing projectors I've seen in this price range.</blockquote></p>
