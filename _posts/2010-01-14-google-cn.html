<p>David Drummond, SVP, Corporate Development and Chief Legal Officer at Google, responds to large-scale security attacks against Google to gain access to Chinese human rights advocates' Gmail accounts:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have decided we are no longer willing to continue censoring our results on Google.cn, and so over the next few weeks we will be discussing with the Chinese government the basis on which we could operate an unfiltered search engine within the law, if at all. We recognize that this may well mean having to shut down Google.cn, and potentially our offices in China.</blockquote><br />
The fact that Chinese censorship and Google co-existed for more than four years since January 2006 is surprising. My guess is Google.cn will cease to exist in the very near future. The right move for Google but China's citizens will suffer a major setback toward freedom of speech and access to it.
