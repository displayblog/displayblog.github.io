<p>Sharp's 52-inch LC-52LB3 and 46-inch LC-46LB3 are the latest in the AQUOS Quattron 3D line of HDTVs and now include Blu-ray recorders. The ASV LCD panels sport a 1920x1080 pixel format, 176-degree viewing angles, and a LED backlight. The convenience is that you don't need to buy a separate Blu-ray recorder and deal with an extra remote control, wires, etc. But on the flip side if the Blu-ray recorder fails...
