<p><a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/blog/2012/03/retracting-mr-daisey-and-the-apple-factory">Ira Glass</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Daisey lied to me and to This American Life producer Brian Reed during the fact checking we did on the story, before it was broadcast. That doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t excuse the fact that we never should&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve put this on the air. In the end, this was our mistake.</blockquote></p>
<p>Shame.</p>
