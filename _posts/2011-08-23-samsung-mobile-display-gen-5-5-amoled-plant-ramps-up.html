<blockquote><p>The long-anticipated growth in size and volume of AMOLED display manufacturing is finally becoming a reality, with Samsung Mobile Display&acirc;&euro;&trade;s (SMD) ramp-up of the first Gen 5.5 AMOLED fab. The company began installing equipment in its A2 factory in December 2010 and is now expected to reach maximum capacity of 80,000 substrates per month by the end of Q1&acirc;&euro;&trade;12.</blockquote></p>
<p>Most of the mobile OLED displays manufactured by SMD is used internally for Galaxy-branded smartphones. With the world's largest Gen 5.5 OLED fab, Samsung will attempt to manufacture larger tablet-sized OLED displays and possibly integrate OLED displays into all Samsung-branded smartphones.</p>
