<p>Westaim is a small Canadian company that makes drugs and ointments but also owns a subsdiar, iFire Corp. iFire&#39;s TV technology is the only solid state flat panel TV technology--and requires no gasses, liquids, vacuums, etc. The panel consists of pastes, chemicals and dielectric materials layered onto a 34" diagonal glass that is 1" thick. The reason why Westaim and its investors are anxious to get things going for iFire is that the production cost (CoP) of iFire&#39;s TV panel is much cheaper than LCD or plasma TVs: $300 CoP for a 34" model that translates into about a $1000 retail price. That is cheap, but not that cheap. For instance, there are no-named brands that are selling 32" LCD TVs at retailers like Wal-Mart that go for less than $1000. iLo, a Wal-Mart in-house brand, has a 32" LCD TV with a digital tuner (ATSC) that is selling for $867. That&#39;s $133 cheaper than iFire&#39;s projection. Of course, it&#39;s also 2" smaller. However with CoP reductions continuing at a rapid pace at dozens of LCD manufacturers, iFire&#39;s CoP advantage might last only a short while.
