<p>The question: which one is the better display? The answer: you'll need to wait for it. Dr. Raymond Soneira, President of <a href="http://www.displaymate.com/db/">DisplayMate Technologies</a>, is wrapping up his extensive testing of these two displays and will be publishing the results early next week. For now, here's two major surprises.</p>
<p>Dr. Soneira:</p>
<blockquote><p>Both the iPhone 4 and Samsung Galaxy S Super OLED had low screen reflectance, which is very important for smartphones because they are typically used under bright ambient light, but the Galaxy S beat the iPhone 4 by a wide margin.</blockquote></p>
<p>According to Dr. Soneira, one of the most important features, if not <em>the</em> most important, is screen reflectance. The more there is the worse the display. Well, the Super AMOLED on the Samsung Galaxy S beat out Apple's iPhone 4. Big time.</p>
<blockquote><p>The iPhone 4 had by far the lowest power consumption of all of the displays (for the same peak luminance and screen size and for typical white screen backgrounds). The Galaxy S tied the iPhone 4 only when displaying rather dark images.</blockquote></p>
<p>And this is the big surprise for most folks. We've been bombarded with marketing that tells us AMOLED displays consume less power than "conventional" LCDs. That simply isn't true. The Retina Display on the iPhone 4 is a power miser and the Super AMOLED ties it only when showing dark images.</p>
<p>Dr. Soneira promises there will be even more surprises so make sure to come back to this very post early next week to find out what those are.</p>
