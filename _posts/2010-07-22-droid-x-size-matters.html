<p><img src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Motorola_Droid_X_Android_Smartphone1.jpg" alt="" title="Motorola_Droid_X_Android_Smartphone" width="512" height="324" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12006" /></p>
<p>Just look at the photo above (source: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/07/22/droid-x-users-gobbling-up-5x-the-data-of-other-verizon-smartphon/">Engadget</a>) and you'll realize Motorola's Droid X is massive, precisely because the display is. At 4.3 inches the Droid X is 0.8 inches or almost 23% larger than the 3.5-inch LCD on the iPhones.</p>
<p>The Droid X is on Verizon, touted as the most reliable network in the US. I wish the iPhone 4 was too. According to Jennifer Byrne, a business development executive director at Verizon, Droid X users consume five times the data of other smartphones. Now why would that be?</p>
<p>I offer my unscientific opinion: because the display is big.</p>
<p>The 4.3-inch LCD make use of 800x480, which is a pixel format found in much smaller smartphones. Relatively speaking the 4.3-inch LCD-sporting Droid X provides larger fonts and icons thanks to the same number of pixels on a larger screen. The pixels are bigger. They are not as beautiful to look at compared to the stuff you see on the iPhone 4's Retina Display but they are bigger and therefore easier to look at. For some, or a lot, that might be the difference leading to much more bandwidth usage. But there's something missing.</p>
<p>Verizon said five times the bandwidth of other smartphones on its network. But what's the average bandwidth usage of other smartphones? Do Droid X users use more bandwidth than the folks on iPhones? That would be interesting to find out.</p>
<p>So, what does this all mean? Big screens with big fonts and icons leads to more data usage. Just a hunch, but I think Droid X users are pulling down a lot more video than other users. IMO, the display is just about the right size to enjoy a personal movie experience.</p>
