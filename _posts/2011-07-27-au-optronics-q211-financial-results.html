<p><a href="http://www.auo.com/?sn=107&lang=en-US&c=11&n=1190">AUO</a>: Consolidated revenue increased 5.2% Q/Q to NT$98,050 million, but the second-largest Taiwan-based LCD manufacturer posted a net loss of NT$10,766 million.</p>
<p>AUO CFO Andy Yang:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the second quarter of 2011, owing to macro uncertainties and customers' inventory adjustments, which impacted the order momentum, AUO's revenue growth and panel pricing trend were weaker than expected.</blockquote></p>
<p>The trick, it seems, is to expect better.</p>
