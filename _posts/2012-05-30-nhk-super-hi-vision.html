<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/29/3042847/super-hi-vision-tv-8k-nhk-future">Sam Byford, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Viewing Super Hi-Vision content on the screen is a surreal experience &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; any closer than six feet or so and it's almost too much information to take in. Like sitting in the front row at an IMAX movie, you constantly have to look around the display and actively watch for where the camera's focus lies.</blockquote></p>
<p>7680x4320 on a 145-inch Panasonic plasma. Fantastic.</p>

<blockquote><p>Why the fuss? TV has been doing this for many years. The reason is that we were viewing using an Ultra-HD system called Super Hi-Vision (SHV) developed by NHK (The Japanese national broadcaster). SHV has sixteen times as many pixels as HDTV making a picture with 7680 pixels across by 4320 pixels down. It was displayed on an 8-metre wide screen, accompanied by a 22.2 multichannel 3-dimensional sound system. The combined effect was to transport the people in the viewing theatre right into the stadium &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; telepresence comes of age.</blockquote></p>
<p>7680x4320 pixels projected unto a 300-inch screen. The best keeps getting better and better.</p>
