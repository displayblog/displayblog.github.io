<p><a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/kindle-fire-usability.html">Jakob Nielsen</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Amazon.com's new <strong>Kindle Fire offers a disappointingly poor user experience</strong>. Using the web with the Silk browser is clunky and error-prone. Reading downloaded magazines is not much better.</blockquote></p>
<p>Emphasis not mine.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/2011/12/14/kindle-fire-does-not-fire-the-imagination">Khoi Vinh</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Kindle software itself is a lousy reading experience; the justified, un-hyphenated typography is an eyesore, the font selection is depressingly homely, and the line-spacing is visually erratic. The net effect is that it feels like I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m consuming a pirated version of whatever book I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m reading, a sensation which might have been fine on earlier versions of Kindle hardware, but seems lazy on a device capable of producing beautiful results. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m not saying that iBooks is perfect, but Amazon&acirc;&euro;&trade;s focus and head start on the reading experience should have put them in a much better position than this.</blockquote></p>
