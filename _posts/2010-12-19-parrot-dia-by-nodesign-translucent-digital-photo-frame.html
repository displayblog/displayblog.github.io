<p>Parrot DIA by Nodesign is a wireless digital photo frame with a disintegrated LCD: the LCD panel has been disengaged from the backlight unit with fascinating results. Here's what <a href="http://www.parrot.com/dia/en">Parrot</a> says about this "unique technology":</p>
<blockquote><p>You will notice the frame's originality straightaway, with its screen and light arranged in two separate places.</blockquote></p>
<p>A LCD panel is naturally translucent, but you'd never know because a purely opaque backlight unit blocks the back. But, when the two are separated, like it is in the Parrot DIA, the translucent effect comes alive.</p>

<p>A "digital Ektachrome picture" is how Parrot describes the effect, which I really dig.</p>
