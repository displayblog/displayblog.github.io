  fairly decent. The 1366 x 768 pixel format will let you pump <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=720p\">720p</a>
  HD signals but they will need to be scaled up a bit to fit the whole screen. That
  means a slight degradation of quality but most folks won't notice it too much. With

  now and after February 2009 when the US turns off NTSC signals. There are only two
  HDMI ports and that might not be enough for everyone. You've exhausted both HDMI
  ports with just a <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=blu-ray\">Blu-ray</a>
  player and a cable box. Of course you can connect via analog but to get really nice
  pictures you'll need to spend a good deal of money on cables. BTW, digital cables
  are digital cables; don't spend a lot on those. The cheap ones will work just as
  well as the expensive ones. Analog cables are different: spend the money here. The
  better the analog cable the better the signal the better the picture quality on

  I really dislike obnoxious lights on the front that distract you from enjoying what's
  on the display. "

<p>According to Amazon.com's reviews the KDL-37M4000 seems to be hit or miss. Some say the picture quality is excellent while others say the picture is not bright enough or is fuzzy and pixelated. My guess to the problem? Feeding the KDL-47M4000 SD signals or bad quality HD signals. SD signals on 720p or <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1080p">1080p</a> capable LCD TVs will generally not look so great. If you are planning to spend a good portion of your time watching SD, I would stick to the CRT TV ('tube' TV) that you already have. Unless you spend an enormous amount of money on a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/06/05/sony-kdl-55xbr8-55-1080p-lcd-tv/">Sony's XBR8</a>, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/11/26/pioneer-kuro-pdp-5020fd-50-1080p-plasma-tv-for-2248-at-sixth-avenue-electronics/">Pioneer's KURO</a> or <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/04/08/mitsubishi-laservue-laser-tv/">Mitsubishi's Laser TV</a>, the humble tube TV you have sitting around will have much better picture quality.</p>
<p>Most children's DVDs are in SD format as well so if you've got a grand collection of children's DVDs I would not invest money in an expensive HD-capable TV. The expensive HD TV will look very poor compared to the tube TV. Analog broadcast signals might be turned off next Februrary, but if you've got Comcast, Verizon or AT&amp;T sending you TV signals and you have a SD TV, you have nothing to worry about: those services will still work after the government turns off the analog signals.
