<p>This smartphone or pdaphone or whatever you want to call these convergence communication-multimedia devices has a lot going for it. I won't discuss all of it since there are many other sites that do a much better job. I'm here to talk about the display. The pixel format is 320 x 240, better than the usual 240 x 240 for Windows Mobile OS-based devices. The TFT LCD generates 65,000 colors, but I had a dang 'ol time finding out the screen size. My best guess is a 2.4" TFT LCD screen, but it's just a guess. 2.4" is not all that big, but since the entire unit is pretty small at 116 x 63 x 11.5mm, the screen looks like it is taking up about 45% of the entire unit, which is a good thing. You don't want a big fat body and have a small screen in it.</p>

<p>Ed Zander is Motorola's CEO and he said a few things at the Gartner Symposium/ITxpo in San Francisco today. One of the things that he said was that Motorola will equip 65,000 employees with products similar to the Q, reducing the need for mobile workers to have physical offices. Starbucks, here they come! I personally don't think the Q is powerful enough to do what I need to do with a PC. Just the display alone won't do it: right now, I have two full-sized FireFox browser windows up side-by-side on my 1920 x 1200 pixel format display. Can't do that on this puny 2.4". But the Q is infinitely more portable, so I would use it to see if I have any urgent emails via Outlook to respond to and that's probably productivity at its max when it comes to Office applications. Please, don't force me to surf the Internet using a 320 x 240 screen! I would much prefer <a href="http://www.learningcenter.sony.us/Notebooks/UXMicroPC/Research/UXMicroPCFeatures#design">Sony's UX Micro PC</a>'s 4.5" LCD with 1024 x 600 pixel format. Although it's not perfect (more the better!), it's quite a bit more useable as a PC replacement.</p>
