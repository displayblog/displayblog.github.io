<p><a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2011/07/07/gateway-shrinks-the-bezel-with-14-inch-id47-notebook/">CrunchGear</a>: Now this is more edge-to-edge than anything I've seen so far on a notebook PC. Gateway has packed a 14-inch LCD into a 13.3-inch chassis in its ID47 notebook PC. Impressive. Unfortunately the pixel format is an anemic 1366x768.</p>
