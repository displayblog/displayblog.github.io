<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/electronics//ref=sv_etk_ce_av__1">Amazon.com</a>: As of this writing, Amazon's Kindle is the number 2 best selling item in the Electronics department at Amazon.com. The Amazon Kindle is an e-book reader that incorporates an electronic paper display (EPD) based on E Ink's technology. Not only that the Kindle allows for almost instant gratification as it has a persistent EV-DO connection to the Kindle Store. </p>
<p>But the fact that the Kindle is the number 2 best selling item is amazing considering that it is a high-priced item: $359.00 ($40.99 less than before). Is there a tectonic shift in how people are consuming books, newspapers, magazines, etc.?</p>
