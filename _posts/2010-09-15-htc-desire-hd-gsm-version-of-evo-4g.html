<p>The HTC Desire HD has a huge 4.3-inch LCD but sports the same 800x480 pixel format as most other Android smartphones with small-sized displays. The HTC Desire HD is the GSM version of the EVO 4G except it is just 3G and foregoes the kickstand. Powered by a 1GHz Qualcomm 8255 Snapdragon CPU running Android 2.2 with a layer of HTC Sense, the Desire HD should be quick. An 8MP camera with autofocus, LED flash and 720p HD video recording capabilities are onboard.</p>
<p>Dolby Mobile and SRS virtual surround sound... on a smartphone: I'll reserve my judgement until I actually experience it, but something tells me it'll be more gimmicky than anything.</p>
<p>HTCSense.com is HTC's Sense online. You can send/receive text messages online, forward calls to another number and even remotely wipe your Desire HD or <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/09/15/htc-desire-z/">Desire Z</a>. I think the gigantic 4.3-inch LCD should be packed with quite a bit more pixels. If LG Display (LGD) can pack 960x640 pixels into a 3.5-inch LCD then I'm guessing something like a 1280x720 pixel format should be ideal for a 4.3-inch one.
