<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/12/12/2627847/motorola-xoom-2-review">Vlad Savov, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fortunately, the company has learned from its folly and has returned with an IPS LCD in the Xoom 2 that is light years ahead of its predecessor. Colors are richer and more accurate, viewing angles are drastically improved, and although glare remains a problem, it's a much smaller one now. The only issue I encountered was that, at a certain angle, the backlight would overwhelm the image in front of it, washing out your view. I wouldn't worry too much about that, however, since the particular angle you need is close to 70 degrees off center, meaning that most of the time you'll be enjoying a tablet with a legitimately up-to-date display.</blockquote></p>
<p>IPS is better than other display technologies like PVA, MVA, ASV, etc. but there are different levels of IPS and the one in the Xoom 2 doesn't seem to be the best:</p>
<blockquote><p>It bears noting that the IPS screen inside the Xoom 2 is not quite on a par with the IPS display of the iPad (first or second generation) or the SuperIPS+ you'll find on the Asus Eee Pad Transformer Prime. It's good, just not that good. A more fitting comparison for the Xoom 2 would be Asus's older-generation Eee Pad Transformer, which is equipped with another of these slightly less than sublime IPS panels.</blockquote></p>
