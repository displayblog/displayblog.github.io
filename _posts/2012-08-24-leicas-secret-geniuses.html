<a href="http://www.humansinvent.com/#!/8687/pursuit-of-perfection-hand-crafting-a-leica-lens/">Leica Director of Product Management Stefan Daniel</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>At Leica we have very experienced, very knowledgeable and very talented people in the optical design department. In fact, because it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a very specialised discipline it takes years to get to that level of knowledge and know-how. The secret is having geniuses to make the very best lenses.</blockquote></p>
