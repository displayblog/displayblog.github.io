<p class="P2">Syntax-Brillian announced the launch of its Olevia brand of LCD TVs in Japan. The company is working with Japan-based HD VOD equipment and services provider BMT. Olevia TVs will debut in Japan in late March 2007. NTT Group, one of the largest telecommunications company in Japan, will purchase 3,000 42" LCD TVs for the public display and commercial markets. NTT Group is expected to be a major customer for Olevia Japan.</p></p>
<p class="P1">BMT will support Olevia Japan, the Japan branch of Syntax-Brillian, in marketing, logistics and support. BMT also ordered 20,000 42" LCD TVs from Syntax-Brillian with delivery expected to begin during the second quarter of 2007.</p></p>
<p class="P2">In the second half of 2007, Syntax-Brillian is planning to introduce 42", 47", 52" and 65" Olevia 1080p LCD TVs in Japan. The company anticipates strong sales of about 50,000 units for Olevia Japan in 2007. With the Beijing Olympics in 2008, Syntax-Brillian expects a strong increase in demand, around 60,000 to 80,000, for its Olevia LCD TVs.</p></p>
<p class="P2">Shinichi Hirabayashi, a former general manager of Toshiba, will lead Olevia Japan that is located near Tokyo. Hirabayashi will collaborate with BMT on the design and development of the new LCD TVs for the Japanese market. This announcement by Syntax-Brillian follows a recent introduction of Olevia LCD TVs in Taiwan on March 2, 2007.</p></p>
<p class="P2">Syntax-Brillian is no household name in many countries, but the company seems to be executing its expansion plans exceptionally well. The company also has a strategic supply agreement with LG.Philips LCD which explains the choice of sizes for its LCD TVs.</p></p>
