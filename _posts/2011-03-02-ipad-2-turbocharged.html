<blockquote><p>This thing is insanely fast. We're not joking -- it's blazingly fast. Everything the iPad 2 does feels like it's on turbo. We're uploading a video of the some evidence of this, you'll be appropriately stunned.</blockquote></p>
<p>Same display, similar and hopefully optimized iOS 4.3, and up to double the horsepower. Sounds like the ingredients to a turbocharged experience.</p>
<blockquote><p>The design feels great in your hands. Sleek, super thin -- much nicer to hold than the previous version. Definitely has more of a magazine than book feel. Everything is tight and solid. It is pretty amazing how thin they've gotten the device.</blockquote></p>
<p>I hope the good folks at Apple saw it fit to optically laminate the cover glass to the LCD itself, and in the process shaving off a few millimeters in thickness and getting rid of any possibility of dust being captured in the air gap between the two.</p>
