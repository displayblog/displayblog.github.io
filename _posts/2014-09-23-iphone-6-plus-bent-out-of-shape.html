<p>Kelly Hodgkins, <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/23/iphone-6-plus-bending-pockets/">MacRumors</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As highlighted in a few reports <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1785905">shared in the <em>MacRumors</em> forums</a>, a small but growing number of iPhone 6 Plus owners have reportedly bent their phones after carrying the devices in their pockets just days after launch. In <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?p=19825874&postcount=1">one instance</a>, a new iPhone 6 Plus was bent during a day of dancing, dining, and driving to a wedding.</blockquote></p>
<p>Crap happens when you are not careful in the quest for super thin, super light, etc.</p>
<p>I think Apple made the wrong decision to make it so thin; Apple should have made it slightly thicker &mdash; which enhances rigidity &mdash; to make the camera flush with the body. And can you imagine how much more battery could have been shoved in there?</p>
<p>If you have an unbreakable habit of putting large smartphones in your pocket &mdash; front, back, does not matter &mdash; but are flexible enough to try Android, I highly recommend the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2013/10/14/lg-g-flex/">LG G Flex</a>.</p>
