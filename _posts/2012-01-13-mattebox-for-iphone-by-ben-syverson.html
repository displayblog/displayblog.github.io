<blockquote><p>I try not to use words like "masterpiece" here very often, but Mattebox&acirc;&euro;&trade;s interface design is so thoughtful and detailed, it just might warrant the term. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s one thing to pack your camera app with features that let you control every possible aspect of the image. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s quite another to design them so that they don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t get in the way of actually making an image in the decisive moment.</blockquote></p>
