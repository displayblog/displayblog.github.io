<p><a href="http://cadence.cc/"><em>Cadence & Slang</em></a> Chapter 4: Managing expectations:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many designers are now considering something called goal- oriented design. Through this, designs are framed in terms of the user&acirc;&euro;&trade;s goals. We dictate the steps that users should go through to complete a task, and design from there.</p>
<p>A major premise behind goal-oriented design is that <em>users don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t care about what makes technology work</em>. When users sit down with a computer, for example, they think &acirc;&euro;&oelig;I need to send an email,&acirc;&euro; not &acirc;&euro;&oelig;I need to click these buttons in order to send an email.&acirc;&euro; And when users see your product, they should say &acirc;&euro;&oelig;it helps me deal with this problem I have.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>Quite challenging. But a good challenge. As of this writing there are only 400 copies remaining.</p>
