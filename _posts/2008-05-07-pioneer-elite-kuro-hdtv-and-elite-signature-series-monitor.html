<p>Elite KURO Signature Series Monitors<br />
According to Pioneer, many parts of the Elite monitors are hand selected and hand assembled. Just like in automobiles, attention to detail is paramount when convincing consumers to spend thousands of dollars on a high-end display. In addition to the attention to detail and hand assembly, a certificate is included that confirms the superior level of panel performance and near flawless aesthetics for every serial number created in this exclusive line of monitors. </p>
<p>Elite KURO HDTV<br />
One of the features of the Elite KURO HDTV is an enhanced "Optimum Mode" that examines the sound, picture and room lighting conditions at the same time and actively adjusts the audio and video to maximize viewing experience. There are six picture and sound presets.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this active adjusting depending on the lighting conditions is all that great of a feature. One time, I rented a car to go down to Los Angeles. I like to listen to music while I drive so I turned on the music and off I went. What was interesting was that the music volume would change all by itself. This threw me off. When I entered the highway, the receiver would automatically increase the volume. When I exited off the highway for a rest stop, it would decrease the volume. It was so annoying I stopped listening to music during that drive down to LA. Now, if this is going to happen with the audio AND video on this super expensive KURO, that might drive me nuts. I hope there is a way to turn the automatic adjustment thingy off.</p>
