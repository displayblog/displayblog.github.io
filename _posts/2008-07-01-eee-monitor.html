<p>Not much is known about the Eee Monitor. The size? Maybe a 20" wide LCD with a pixel format of 1366 x 768 or a 19" wide LCD with a 1440 x 900. The overall design looks quite nice. The Eee Monitor comes in black or white.</p>

<p>If you look closely at the picture above, it seems the audio portion or at least the built-in speakers were done by Denon, a cool thing. I do like the transparent plastic (?) bottom.</p>

<p>The weird thing about this monitor is that it doesn't have any VGA or DVI or HDMI or DisplayPort or anything like that. Maybe this monitor is one of those USB-connected types via some cooperation with DisplayLink. The <a href="http://blog.laptopmag.com/add-another-to-the-eee-family-eee-monitor-revealed">Laptop article incorrectly states</a> that there are two Ethernet ports, but if you look really closely, it's actually one modem and one Ethernet port.</p>

Maybe this isn't a monitor at all but a complete all-in-one computer! Anyway, that would also be cool because this Eee 'Monitor' seems to be quite thin. Or maybe it's an Internet-connected Eee TV. Who knows. Time will tell. Or do <em>you</em> know something?</p>
