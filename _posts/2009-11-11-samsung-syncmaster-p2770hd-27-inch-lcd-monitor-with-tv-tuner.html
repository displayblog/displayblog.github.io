<p><a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/consumer/office/monitors/premium/LS27EMNKUY/ZA/index.idx?pagetype=prd_detail&amp;tab=features">Samsung</a>: The Samsung SyncMaster P2770HD is a 27-inch LCD monitor with built-in TV tuner. The 27-inch LCD sports a 1920x1080 resolution. If you sit in front of the computer all day but still want to watch TV, the P2770HD might be a very suitable solution for you. The 27-inch LCD is certainly large enough to sit back in your office chair and the 1080p resolution will show off over-the-air terrestrial HD signals just right.</p>
<p>Samsung points to some design touches on the P2270HD: a crystal bezel, transparent neck on the stand, and touch-sensitive power button. There are two 3W speakers.</p>

I really like the large size and the plethora of connectivity options. But, there are a few things that make me pause in my excitement. The viewing angles are not so great at just 170/160; that tells me Samsung has used a cheap TN panel instead of its excellent PVA panel. Next up is Samsung's showcasing the 50,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio: that number doesn't mean anything. It isn't bright enough. The 300 cd/m2 is certainly not dim for a monitor but when you're marketing it to be used as a TV that will quite possibly be used during the day for a quick 10-minute TV break, the brightness isn't enough especially when you're trying to "sit back, relax, and enjoy the show". The price sounds good enough but with 42-inch 1080p LCD TVs that are going for under $500, I'm not too sure it's competitive enough.</p>
