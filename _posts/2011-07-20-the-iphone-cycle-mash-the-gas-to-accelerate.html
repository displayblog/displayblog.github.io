<blockquote><p>So we are witnessing a pivotal moment in the product&acirc;&euro;&trade;s strategy. By slightly lifting off the gas in terms of product cycle, Apple actually set the iPhone loose. The imposition of a yearly cycle on the product coupled with unlimited demand caused it to be artificially constrained.</blockquote></p>
<p>Don't forget, the iPhone 3GS is still in production and has been since June 19, 2009. Apple has been selling the iPhone 3GS, specifically the 8GB version, for over two years.</p>
<p>With the introduction of the iPhone 4, Apple discontinued the 16GB and 32GB versions of the 3GS, and dropped the 8GB price to $99. Early January 2011, Apple dropped the price further to $49. With each price drop iPhone 3GS sales probably increased. Price could hit $0 and sales might rocket up even more.</p>
<p>The GSM iPhone 4 was released June 24, 2010. It's been 392 days. The CDMA iPhone 4 was released February 10, 2011 (161 days). The white iPhone 4 was released April 28, 2011 (84 days). For almost the entire last quarter Apple has been selling five distinct iPhone models (two colors each for GSM and CDMA, 3GS). I would consider this <em>mashing</em> the gas.</p>
