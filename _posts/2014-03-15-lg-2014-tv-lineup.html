<blockquote><p>LG Electronics (LG) today introduced its 2014 TV lineup in Korea, unveiling a total of 68 new models including ULTRA HD TVs in sizes ranging from 49 to 105 inches, its largest collection to date. Among its new models is LG&acirc;&euro;&trade;s ground breaking 105-inch Curved ULTRA HD TV in addition to its smaller 65-, 55- and 49-inch curved 4K units.</blockquote></p>
<p>On March 11, 2014 LG unveiled a total of <em>68</em> new TV models in South Korea. Perhaps there needs to be a bit more focus?</p>
<p>Curved 4K TVs if used as a TV in the living room aren't going to be that useful, but curved 4K TVs if used as a monitor in the home office will. Think of it this way: Wouldn't you love to work at a workstation with a 2x2 multi-screen setup? Of course you do. Four 24-inch 1920x1080 monitors in a 2x2 format is equivalent to one 48-inch 3840x2160 monitor. Now imagine it curved. Beautiful isn't it?</p>
