<p>From a <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20100909PD210.html">Digitimes</a> article paraphrasing Acer founder Stan Shih:</p>
<blockquote><p>... Apple's strong popularity is mainly due to its products such as iPad and iPhone, and these products are like mutant viruses, which are difficult to find a cure for in the short-term, but he believes that PC vendors will eventually find a way to isolate Apple and become immune.</blockquote></p>
<p>I think Shih would have a difficult time watching <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dx-men%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&tag=displ0f-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957">X-Men</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=displ0f-20&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.</p>
