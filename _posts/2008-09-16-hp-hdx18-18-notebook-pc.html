<p>An <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=18"-notebook-pc">18" notebook PC</a> will be very big. I have a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=17"">17"</a> and its considered a monster. So the HDX18, the latest from <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=hp">HP</a>, would be considered a beast. The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=18"">18"</a> TFT LCD is a special kind though. Instead of the usual 16:10 aspect ratio with a pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1200">1920 x 1200</a>, the HDX18 has the 16:9 kind. And with that you get a bit less pixels at <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a>. But if you are viewing HD content, you wouldn't have to deal with black bars, so that's cool. As far as I know, the only HD content that comes in at 16:9 aspect ratio is via TV, so you'll need to get a way to get all those 16:9 HD content into your HDX18 or you've just got dinged 120 horizontal lines. Have I mentioned that I dislike, to a very large degree, having to type off-center? Well, that's what I'll have to do if I had a HDX18. But for some of you who like to have a numeric keypad, the HDX18 won't disappoint. With the CPU, GPU, RAM and HDD combination, the HDX18 looks to be a multimedia powerhouse, though I would have thought HP would have crammed a faster CPU. But with a price starting at just $1549, you're still getting quite a bit.</p>
