<blockquote><p>The problem with the Tab is that is is too early and too late. Compared to the iPad is feels clunky, cheaper and less polished. For the upcoming Android OS for tablets it is obviously too early.</blockquote></p>
<p>User experience is key and the Galaxy Tab fails miserably in one very important regard:</p>
<blockquote><p>To turn the Tab on you have to press a little hidden button on the side. Not hard to find once you know it but a first hurdle for every owner expecting it to be simple. Most people looked the device over for 5 seconds and then just gave up and asked me &acirc;&euro;&oelig;How do you turn it on?&acirc;&euro;¬ù.</blockquote></p>
<p>Regular folks can't turn it on. Game over.</p>
