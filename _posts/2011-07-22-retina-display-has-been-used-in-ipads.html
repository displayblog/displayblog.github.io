<p>Yoo-chul Kim, <a href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2011/07/123_91412.html">The Korea Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>He said more smartphone manufacturers will release new models employing LG&acirc;&euro;&trade;s "Retina Display" that has been used in iPhones and iPads.</blockquote></p>
<p>He being Young-soo Kwon, CEO of LG Display. Kwon's comment begs some questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The exclusivity between LG Display and Apple for the Retina Display used in the iPhone 4. Is it over?</li>
<li>Was Kwon's remark about a Retina Display used in iPads a Freudian slip? Or was he just mistaken?</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Remember there are two Retina Displays at the moment. The one with IPS technology goes into the iPhone 4. The iPod touch sports the lesser one without IPS. Those two are it; there is no Retina Display used in iPads.</p>
<p>Not for sale anyway.</p>
<p>There is the possibility that Kwon was simply mistaken about the company's Retina Display being used in iPads, but let's assume it was a Freudian slip.</p>
<p>In Kwon's mind LG Display's 9.7-inch Retina Display has been used in prototype iPads for quite some time. To him a Retina Display-equipped iPad is already a reality and just a matter of time before it is available for sale to the public.</p>
