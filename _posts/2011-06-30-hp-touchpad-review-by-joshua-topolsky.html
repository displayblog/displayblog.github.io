<p><a href="http://thisismynext.com/2011/06/29/hp-touchpad-review/">Joshua Topolsky</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The screen is a 1024 x 768, 9.7-inch LCD with capacitive touch. If that sounds familiar, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s because it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s pretty much the iPad display to a tee. Compared side-by-side with the iPad 2, I was impressed with the clarity and color tone on the TouchPad, though it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s worth noting that brightness was noticeably dimmer on the HP device. Viewing angles were also comparable between the two screens.</blockquote></p>
<p>Dimmer? The bright LCD on the iPad 2 is terrible out in the sun. I can only imagine how bad the TouchPad will be.</p>
<blockquote><p>In particular, I found touch sensitivity and general fluidity of the user interface to be wanting badly at times. Presses to buttons on the screen would go unanswered, applications would suddenly pause, lists I was scrolling moved intermittently and erratically (or would just disappear altogether). Sometimes the device felt smooth and light, while at other moments it locked up or sputtered to a point of complete aggravation.</blockquote></p>
<p>This is exactly <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/06/30/hp-touchpad-review-by-jason-snell/">what Jason Snell experienced</a>. I'm somewhat surprised that HP thinks the TouchPad is ready for primetime.</p>
<p>Topolsky's conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p>Still, the bottom line here is that the stability and smoothness of the user experience is not up to par with the iPad or something like the Galaxy Tab 10.1, even if many of the underlying ideas are actually a lot better and more intuitive than what the competition offers.</blockquote></p>
