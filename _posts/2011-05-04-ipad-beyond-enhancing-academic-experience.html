<blockquote><p>Consensus is the integration of the iPad can enhance a student&acirc;&euro;&trade;s academic experience and have a positive impact for faculty as well. We used the iPad in every aspect of our course. The most important consideration is the device must be truly integrated. Simply distributing the device without evaluation of how the course might be modified for its use limits the impact.</blockquote></p>
<p>In my opinion the iPad stands alone as a computing tool that is easy to truly integrate into a student's academic experience. The iPad also helped reduce administrative expenses.</p>
