<blockquote><p>... Chimei Innolux (CMI) is expected to start supplying iPad panels in 2011 and account for 10% of the total iPad panels in the first quarter, rising to 15% in the second, 20% in the third, and up to 30% in the fourth. CMI is expected to start iPad panel production in January 2011...</blockquote></p>
<p>If this is true, and there is a good chance that it isn't, CMI must have acquired what it takes to manufacture IPS LCD panels. Do I want CMI IPS LCDs in my iPad 2.0? Nope. LG Display-made, please.</p>
