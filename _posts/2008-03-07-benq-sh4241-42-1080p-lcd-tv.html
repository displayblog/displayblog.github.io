BenQ's SH4241 is a nicely designed 42" 1080p LCD TV. Some might like the red bar accent and some might not. I just hope it doesn't get in the way of experiencing what is on the LCD. A special feature of the SH4241 is an integrated ambient light sensor. Ambient light sensors have been around for a while and have been integrated into the MacBook Pro for quite some time and now the Air has it too. The light sensor senses the brightness of the environment and modulates the brightness of the screen on the SH4241. I would like to see this technology be incorporated into the remote control as well: when it is dark, the backlit keys would light up as soon as you touch it. The backlight would do nothing if the ambient light was bright.<br />

According to DigiTimes, BenQ and Chunghwa Telecom (CHT) will launch a promotion within Taiwan. Customers who purchase BenQ's 37" and 42" 1080p LCD TVs from Tsann Kuen retail stores will receive a discount for CHT's movie on demand (MOV) subscriptions and a 10MP BenQ digital camera. Folks in Taiwan will need to hurry as the promotion ends March 31.<br />
