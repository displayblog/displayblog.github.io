<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/08/13/british-network-itv-responds-to-apple-itv-rumor-says-it-has-vi/">Engadget</a>: There's a rumor that Apple will be rebranding Apple TV to iTV. Makes sense since almost everything Apple makes has the letter 'i' in front of the name. Well ITV, the British television network, isn't happy about this rumor. Mike Large, ITV's director of communications, pointed out that the company has "vigorously defended" its intellectual property in the past. And that past is probably when Apple approached them back in 2006 and the reason why we have Apple TV today instead of iTV. I've always wondered what kind of whacky name Apple TV was... I say go retro and call it iTelevision.</p>
