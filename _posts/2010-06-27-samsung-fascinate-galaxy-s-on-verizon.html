<p>How many names can the Galaxy S by Samsung have? I'm not sure but there's at least four. The latest is Fascinate and it will come <em>via</em> Verizon according to Samsung's <a href="http://www.samsungusanews.com/2010/06/verizon-wireless-announces-the-samsung-fascinate-a-galaxy-s-smartphone/">press release</a> dated June 28. Fascinate, a Galaxy S smartphone (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/17/samsung-galaxy-s-with-super-amoled/">Samsung Galaxy S with Super AMOLED</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/21/super-amoled-is-decent-in-the-sun/">Super AMOLED Is Decent In The Sun</a></em> for more info), is a non-keyboard Android 2.1 smartphone featuring Samsung Mobile Display's (SMD) 4-inch Super AMOLED display powered by the Hummingbird Cortex A8 CPU running at 1GHz. A 5 megapixel autofocus camera with LED flash is on-board with 720p video recording capabilities. Availability and price are TBD.</p>
