<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904265504576568382745824372.html">The Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>While the retailer said it gained market share in smartphones and tablets&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the hot growth categories in electronics retailing&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;those gains fell short of offsetting declines in its old cash cows, sales of televisions and computers.</blockquote></p>
<p>TV sales have been weak for quite some time and will continue to be for the foreseeable future as long as retailers and brands push stuff few care about, like 3D TVs and "smart TVs". That's one: a mismatch of what companies want to sell us and what we actually want. And then there's another: our TV viewing habits are changing. The folks that buy smartphones and tablets, aren't they using them to watch TV?</p>
