<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/telecom/news/2010/12/clear-disses-verizon-4g-data-caps-why-count-every-megabyte.ars">Ars Technica</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The ITU recently established that 4G technologies have a minimum of 100Mbps speeds while a client is in motion and up to 1Gbps speed while stationary.</blockquote></p>
<p>Clear's WiMAX has a maximum bandwidth of 50Mbps with real speeds of around 3-6Mbps. Verizon's LTE: 5-12Mbps. T-Mobile's HSPA+: 3-7Mbps. Clear, Verizon, and T-Mobile do not have 4G networks. They are technically lying to you and in the process poised to make a lot of money. How much? In Verizon's case $50 per month for 5GB, and $10 for every 1GB after that.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> <a href="http://parislemon.com/post/15575193337/4g">MG Siegler</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Danny Sullivan notes the difference between the iPhone 4S and the Galaxy S II Skyrocket on AT&T. Both are actually running on the same network, but the Galaxy gets the all-important &acirc;&euro;&oelig;4G&acirc;&euro;¬ù moniker.</blockquote></p>
