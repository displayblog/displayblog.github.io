<p>Here's what I've been able to gather so far before tomorrow's Windows Phone 7 launch in New York City at 9:30AM Eastern:</p>
<p>UK WP7 hardware launch: October 21st. 4-inch Super AMOLED, 5 megapixel autofocus camera. Over 2000 apps at launch. Xbox Live. Source: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/09/uk-carriers-roadmap-points-to-october-21-release-for-windows-ph/">Engadget</a></p>
<p>US WP7 Samsung Focus launching November 8th on AT&T. <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/09/windows-phone-7-ads-reveal-samsung-focus-for-atandt-november-8th/">Engadget</a></p>
<p>Joe Belfiore on <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/10/microsoft-windows-phone7/all/1">Wired</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The success of the iPhone certainly had an impact on the industry and an impact on us. And we said there were a lot of things we could do to deliver a solution that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s different from the iPhone but have some of its benefits.</blockquote></p>
<p>WP7 is different enough from iOS and I'm looking forward to seeing how the mobile OS landscape will change in the coming months and into 2011. Note: Although many things have changed (e.g. Windows Mobile 6.5 to Windows Phone 7) there are things that don't seem to have changed (e.g. Silverlight).</p>
