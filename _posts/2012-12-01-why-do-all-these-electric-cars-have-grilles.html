<blockquote><p>The purist in me wants to see clean, grille-less designs that are true to the mechanism of the car, but the realist in me knows that companies need their corporate faces and people generally hold onto tradition.</blockquote></p>
<p>When I think of BMW I think kidney grilles. The kidney grilles identify the brand. Whether petrol, hybrid, or electric as long as it's a BMW I expect those kidney grilles to be there front and center. Not so for other automotive brands. For example, the Mercedes Benz SLS E-Cell need not have a grille at all to identify the brand; all it needs is the three-pointed star logo somewhere up front.</p>
