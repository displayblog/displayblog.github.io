<p><a href="http://www.mitsubishielectric.co.jp/news/2011/0216-d.html">Mitsubishi (Japanese)</a> <em>via</em> <a href="http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20110217/189679/">Tech-On!</a>: Mitsubishi Electric showcased its LCD-46MDR1, a 46-inch LCD TV with a unique backlight composed of a red laser diode and a cyan LED. The cyan LED is used to generate both green and blue while the red laser generates a deep 638-nm wavelength red. Several tens of red laser diodes and several hundred cyan LEDs are used in an edge-lit design.</p></p>
<p>While all other specifications like brightness, contrast ratio, power consumption, etc. are similar to other white LED backlit Mitsubishi LCD TVs, color gamut is improved to 126% NTSC with a marked enhancement in red vividness.</p></p>
