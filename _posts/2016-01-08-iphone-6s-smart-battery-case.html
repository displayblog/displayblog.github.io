<p>[ <a href="http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MGQM2LL/A/iphone-6s-smart-battery-case-white">Apple</a> ] The iPhone 6s Smart Battery Case is curious looking, because Apple unlike almost all the other objects it designs chose to put function (how it feels in your hands) over looks (the hump is ugly). Perhaps Apple should have applied a tiny amount of this function-over-looks way of designing a product onto the iPhone 6s: add back a little bit of thickness, eliminate the camera bulge, and improve battery life. The overall experience would have been more Apple-esque&nbsp;than an iPhone 6s with a Smart Battery Case. That being said,&nbsp;the iPhone 6 and 6s is the first iPhone that looks better in a case, just not the Smart Battery Case, which makes it look worse.</p>
