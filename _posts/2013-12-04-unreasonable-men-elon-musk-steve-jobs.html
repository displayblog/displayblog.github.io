<p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/11/21/leadership/steve-jobs-elon-musk.pr.fortune/index.html">Chris Anderson, CNN Money</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>George Bernard Shaw famously said, "The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man." By that definition, Jobs and Musk are the ultimate in unreasonable men. And the world is so much better for it.</blockquote></p>
