<p>Adobe released Photoshop Lightroom 2.3 Release Candidates. You can <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Lightroom_2.3">download these programs from Adobe Labs</a>. The 'release candidate' indicates that the program requires a bit more tuning before going gold.

<p>What is Lightroom? Simply put it is a digital photography workflow program that lets you import, process, manage and showcase your images.

<p>My OS is Windows Vista Ultimate 64-bit and I'm glad to see that Lightroom makes use of 64-bit. When installing the LR 2.3 RC it automatically detected that my system was 64-bit and began installing the 64-bit version. It took less than 1 minute to install, which is very fast.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting features of LR 2 is that it lets you use two monitors. I have all the workflow functions on one monitor and the photo library on the other: makes for a very pleasant working environment.</p>
<p>I have been searching for a good photo management and manipulation tool. I have used Picasa since it is fairly good with an unbeatable price: free. The integration with Picasa Web Albums is great and makes it very easy to share files. But the photo manipulation tools are quite limited. Lightroom might be the right program for me, a photography enthusiast that still has a lot of learning to do.</p>
<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/apps/adobe-photoshop-lightroom-2-review.ars">ARS Technica</a>&Acirc;&nbsp;did an excellent review of Lightroom 2.0. Although the reviewer found some niggles he generally found the program very good: "Lightroom 2.0 is the first program that I simply love using from a workflow, tagging, and 'they thought of everything' standpoint; and its speed is unmatched."</p>

There are a total of 53 customer reviews at the time of this writing with 31 reviews giving it 5 out of 5 stars. A full 48 reviews are 4 stars or higher. Here are some of the comments:</p>
