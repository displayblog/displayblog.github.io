<p>Hope you had a wonderful weekend! Today we'll be looking at average selling price or ASP trends for 1080p and 4K TV sets that show up on the front page of Amazon when you search for 50-inch and larger TVs that have 4-star or better customer ratings. (<a href="http://displayblog.com/2016/08/25/amzn-tv24/">Click here&nbsp;a brief intro to AMZN.TV24</a>.) We will also look at 4K price premiums over 1080p at some popular sizes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>1080p ASP Trends</strong></p><br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26840" src="http://displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/AMZNTV24_20160829_ASP1080p.jpg" alt="AMZN.TV24 2016.08.29 ASP 1080p" width="590" height="398" /></p>
<p>Let's start with ASPs for 1080p TVs. The first thing that jumps out is the large gap between 75-inch 1080p TV's ASP compared to 65-inch. 75-inch 1080p TV ASPs also swing about more crazily compared to the other sizes. (Note there are no data points for Sundays, which is a day of rest for me.)</p>
<p>Today the ASPs for 65-inch fell quite dramatically, and is only slightly higher than 60-inch. The reason for this is VIZIO's E650i-A2 that popped into the front page for the first time. (Note I will be recording the price as it is shown on Amazon to accurately analyze what potential customers will see on any given day. And that means there will be prices that are new, used, those that include shipping and handling and those that don't, etc. The lower than usual average price&nbsp;for a 60-inch 1080p TV is because of the&nbsp;used price for&nbsp;the E650i-A2.)</p>
<p>55-inch 1080p TV ASPs have been on an upswing since August 25, while 60-inch ASPs remain steady.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>4K ASP Trends</strong></p><br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26841" src="http://displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/AMZNTV24_20160829_ASP4K.jpg" alt="AMZN.TV24 2016.08.29 ASP 4K" width="590" height="398" /></p>
<p>Two data points are missing for 50-inch 4K ASPs on August 23rd and today because there were no 50-inch 4K TVs that showed up on Amazon's front search result page. It seems for 4K, where customers are upgrading from 1080p, is slightly too small. I'd guess the minimum size customers want for a 4K TV is 55 inches.</p>
<p>60-inch 4K TV ASPs took a rather significant jump today and last Saturday, while 55-inch ASPs continued to decline slowly. Although there is only a 5-inch gap between 60-inch and 55-inch the price gap is rather large. The opposite is true between 50-inch and 55-inch: there's a very small gap. If you're looking for a 4K TV to upgrade to, the best deals seem to be at 55-inch.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>4K Premium Trends: 55-inch</strong></p><br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26842" src="http://displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/AMZNTV24_20160829_4KPremium55.jpg" alt="AMZN.TV24 2016.08.29 4K Premium 55-inch" width="590" height="398" /></p>
<p>Let's take a look at how much of a price premium 4K TVs demand over 1080p. Except for the huge drop in price on August 25th, 55-inch 4K price premiums have ranged from US$128 to over $300. The recent decrease in 4K price premiums is not the result of rapid declines in 55-inch 4K TV prices, but rather an uptick in 55-inch 1080p TV prices.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>4K Premium Trends: 60-inch</strong></p><br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26843" src="http://displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/AMZNTV24_20160829_4KPremium60.jpg" alt="AMZN.TV24 2016.08.29 4K Premium 60-inch" width="590" height="398" /></p>
<p>4K price premiums have increased quite a bit at 60-inch, because of ASP increases of 4K 60-inch TVs. Samsung's higher-end UN60KS8000 model started showing up on August 27th skewing the 60-inch 4K ASP upward. Newer more advanced 4K TV models sport such features as quantum dots for wider color gamuts and not 16 million but one billion colors, and HDR or High Dynamic Range. 60-inch 1080p ASPs&nbsp;have held steady for the last 12 data points.</p>
<p>These analyses are a part of a report that I am developing titled AMZN.TV24. I hope the data analysis on ASP trends was helpful and interesting to you. If you have any questions and or comments, feel free to click my name at the top, scroll down to the bottom, and fill out the form. I can't promise I'll get back to everyone, but I'll do my best. Tomorrow I will be sharing size share by 1080p and by 4K to answer: what is the most popular sizes for 4K? And 1080p?</p>
