<p><a href="http://www.asymco.com/2011/08/08/the-fate-of-mobile-phone-brands/">Horace Dediu</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple is always skating in a different direction. iOS needs to be seen as not so much a phone platform but a computing platform. Given what we know, iOS was always conceived as the future of computing. Voice, after all, is just an app on iOS. So my expectation is that Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s iOS will continue its attack on the mobile computing market, skimming (or carving as the case may be) profits from the phone business to sustain its ultimate target of reclaiming the computing universe.</blockquote></p>
<p>Old mobile phone brands like Nokia, Microsoft, RIM are declining. The new brands are actually mobile <em>computing</em> brands. They are Google's Android, Apple's iOS, and Samsung's Bada: all three have grown rapidly in a very short period of time.</p>
