<blockquote><p>The 240Hz LED edge-lit Toshiba 55WX800U's picture quality when displaying 2D images is excellent. And its NetTV menu of Internet streaming partners is top notch. If only its 3D performance was as compelling.</blockquote></p>
<p>Tip: If you are not mounting the TV on the wall, it is better to get a slightly thicker TV with full LED backlight if budget allows. LCD TVs with full LED backlights perform much better than edge-lit counterparts.</p>
