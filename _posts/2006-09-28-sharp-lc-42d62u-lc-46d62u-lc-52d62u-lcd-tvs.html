<p>Sharp introduced three new LCD TVs during CEDIA 2006. The three are LC-42D62U, LC-46D62U, and LC-52D62U. As the model names imply, they are 42&acirc;&euro;&sup3;, 46&acirc;&euro;&sup3;, and 52&acirc;&euro;&sup3; in size all all three toute Full HD resolutions of 1920 x 1080. The LC-42D62U has a 6000:1 contrast ratio, a 6ms response time and two HDMI ports and will retail for a really nice price: $2499. Although Sharp is regarded as a premium brand in most markets, because of the recent price slashing competition between the other &acirc;&euro;&tilde;S&acirc;&euro;&trade; companies Sony and Samsung, Sharp needed to respond with a bit more aggressive pricing and I am glad that they are in the game.</p>

<em>Sharp LC-52D62U</em></p>
<p>Both LC-46D62U and LC-52D62U have an improved contrast ratio of 10000:1 and faster response times of 4ms. The 46&acirc;&euro;&sup3; has a MSRP of $3499 and the 52&acirc;&euro;&sup3; $4799. The case design of these three units are nothing new and I am slowly getting a bit bored by them. As in my <a href="http://displayblog.com/?p=450">previous post</a> about stands, I wish these CE brands would make the stands a bit more sturdy in general so they do not tip over accidentally. I am really looking forward to a 42&acirc;&euro;&sup3; Full HD LCD TV with LED backlights for $1999 in the near future.</p>
