<p>Thin is definitely in. At just 23mm (0.9") <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sharp">Sharp</a>'s AQUOS XS1 series <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a>s are world's slimmest. The XS1 comes in two sizes: 52" and 65". Both sport a pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a> and has double the normal frequency at <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=100hz">100Hz</a>, which should significantly reduce motion blur. Contrast ratio is quite fair at 10,000:1.</p>
<p>From the picture, I am assuming that Sharp is measuring the thickness of the XS1 at its thickest part. Compared to <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/08/27/sony-kdl-40zx1-99mm-thick-40-lcd-tv/">Sony's KDL-40ZX1</a>, Sharp's XS1 is 5mm thinner. Sure, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sony">Sony</a>'s KDL-40ZX1 has the top portion that is just 9.9mm, but anyone can make a portion of the TV really skinny. I say Sharp wins with its XS1 over the KDL-40ZX1. And it isn't even a fair comparison since Sharp's XS1 is at least 12" larger with the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=52">52"</a> version and 25" larger with the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=65">65"</a> version.</p>
