<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/8/3464212/samsung-galaxy-note-ii-review">Vlad Savov, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Galaxy Note&acirc;&euro;&trade;s 1280 x 800 display actually loses a few lines of pixels in the new model, now offering a 1280 x 720 resolution, but Samsung believes the 16:9 aspect ratio and a move away from Pentile technology will be appreciated upgrades for users. Despite no longer employing the standard Pentile RGBG subpixel arrangement, the Note II still doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have three identically sized subpixels per dot &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s now just swapped the extra green for extra blue, so in functional terms, this can be considered a sort of Pentile lite. Another recurring downside to AMOLED panels is a blue tinge to the images displayed, which is very much apparent on the Galaxy Note II. I can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t help but feel that Samsung is nurturing a generation of people who&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll grow up to have a broken internal color balance.</blockquote></p>
<p>A 5.5-inch 1280x720 Super AMOLED Plus would have been perfect. The Plus meaning a RGB subpixel layout. The PenTile Lite might be the reason why the Galaxy Note II lasts two days between charges, but I would have much preferred the power sucking Super AMOLED Plus display reducing battery life to just one day. I am certain I am not alone in my preference.</p>
<p>I thought the top of the line Samsung smartphone was the Galaxy S III. I was wrong; it's the Galaxy Note II.</p>
