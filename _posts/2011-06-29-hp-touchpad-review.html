<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/29/hp-touchpad-review/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As we said earlier, it's a 9.7-inch, 1024 x 768 IPS panel up front that matches the iPad 2 pixel-for-pixel and doesn't disappoint when it comes to other important aspects of viewing. Contrast, viewing angles, and brightness all impress, delivering plenty of light for bright or dark rooms and angles wide enough to make sharing with a friend a cinch.</blockquote></p>
<p>By copying the leader, the iPad, HP didn't mess up a good thing with the TouchPad's display. I wouldn't be surprised if it was the same 9.7-inch IPS TFT LCD that is used in the iPad. Good call, but this just solidifies my opinion that HP has merely become really good at copying Apple.</p>
