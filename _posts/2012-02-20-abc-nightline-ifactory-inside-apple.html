<blockquote><p>Daisey's show was featured on NPR's "This American Life" in January and a listener named Mark Shields was so moved, he launched a petition drive online. Over 250,000 Apple users called on the company to build the first "ethical" iPhone, and protests were planned at Apple stores around the world.</p>
<p>It was around this time when Apple called me. They wondered if "Nightline" was interested in seeing their iPhone, iPad and MacBook final assembly lines at Foxconn during a first-ever audit by the Fair Labor Association.</blockquote></p>
<p>ABC Nightline's "iFactory: Inside Apple" will air Tuesday, Feb. 21 at 11:35 p.m. ET/PT.</p>
