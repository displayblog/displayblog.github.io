<p>Witsview is reporting that second-half of August pricing for LCD monitor panels are up. 17" 1280 x 1024 panel prices are up $3. This is not good if you are waiting for 17" LCD monitor set prices to come down more. I think the time to buy is now. Although a $3 price hike on panels won't necessarily mean a price hike in set prices, the pressure is there because monitor manufacturers' razor thin margins are... well... razor thin.</p>
<p>On the other hand, LCD TV panel prices continued to decline for 42" 1366 x 768 (down $10) and 37" 1366 x 768 (down $5). 20" 640 x 480, 32" 1366 x 768, 40" 1366 x 768 prices remained unchanged. But these changes are so small it probably will not impact set prices that are north of $1500.</p>
