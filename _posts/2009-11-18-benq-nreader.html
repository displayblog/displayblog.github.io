<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20091118PD209.html">DIGITIMES</a>: The BenQ nReader is an ebook reader sporting a SiPix 6-inch touch-enabled electrophoretic display (EPD), will be launched in January 2010 first in Taiwan and then in Japan and China. The launch will be coupled with the company's e-book trading platform. A color version is targeted for the second half of 2010. Supported formats include PDF, HTML, ePub, TXT, BMP, GIF, PNG, MP3. 2GB of memory is built in and with microSD card support. The nReader will go for NT$8,990 (about US$280), which is more expensive than Amazon's Kindle or Barnes and Noble's Nook.</p>
<p>BenQ's vice chairman Jerry Wang expects to sell 50,000 nReaders in Taiwan and 300,000 globally in 2010. The 300,000 unit sales goal represents less than 5% of BenQ's total revenues but the company is preparing for possible explosive growth in ebook readers in the coming years. Wang predicts the ebook reader market will hit 100 million units in 10 years.</p>
