<p><a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20131216005725/en/Amazon-Studios-Shoot-2014-Original-Drama-Comedy">BusinessWire</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;As a premium original content creator, we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re excited about 4K and the future of Ultra HD technology, particularly as we move into drama series next year,&acirc;&euro; said Roy Price, Director of Amazon Studios. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;All of the pilots and series we produce next year will be shot in 4K. That includes our first ever drama series that we will greenlight next year&mdash;we think customers are going to love watching these series in the highest resolution ever available to consumers and we can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t wait to deliver it.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>Anyone wanting to watch 4K streams from Amazon will need a fast broadband pipe, <a href="http://www.ultrahdtv.net/netflix-4k-ultra-hd-streaming-needs-least-15mbps/">about 15 Mbps according to Netflix CEO Reed Hastings</a>. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2013/11/02/netflix-tests-4k-streaming-launching-in-2014/">But I recommend 50 Mbps</a>.</p>
