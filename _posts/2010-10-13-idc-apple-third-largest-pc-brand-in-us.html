<p>IDC is reporting that Apple is now the third largest PC brand in the US, bumping Acer to number four. In the third quarter Apple shipped 1,999K units, up 24.1% Q/Q, capturing 10.6% market share. Acer shipped a slightly less 1,949K. HP is still on top with 4,591K units with Dell slowing down 4.9% Q/Q to 4,352K.</p>
<p>The takeaway here is that Apple is growing, rapidly: 24.1% versus just 3.8% Q/Q for the US PC market as a whole. Source: <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20101013007002/en/Global-PC-Market-Maintains-Double-Digit-Growth-Quarter">BusinessWire</a></p>
