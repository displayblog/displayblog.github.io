<p>Nope, I don't get a commission from www.monoprice.com. But I do feel good when I help a fellow shopper save some money. Read on and find out how you can save a boatload of your hard-earned money. Whether you have a PC or a TV you'll need some kind of cable that didn't come in the box. I'm not sure about the exact figure but most branded PC or TV cables have a profit margin of 100-percent or more built into the price. As you'll soon find out later in this post the difference between getting a cable from MonoPrice rather than Best Buy can save you more than $65!</p>
<p><strong>SAVE</strong> For instance, for the PC you might need one of these cables: VGA-to-DVI, VGA-to-HDMI, VGA-to-VGA, VGA-to-DisplayPort, DVI-to-VGA, DVI-to-HDMI, DVI-to-DisplayPort, DisplayPort-to-DVI, etc. You get the point. Often times when you go to Best Buy or Fry's Electronics the branded cables can cost an arm and a leg. Let's look at an example.</p>
<p>A Dynex-branded 6.5 feet DVI-to-HDMI cable at <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=8701096&amp;st=dvi+cable&amp;type=product&amp;id=1199495204492">Best Buy costs US$49.99</a>. At MonoPrice a "HDMI DVI Cable 28AWG - 6ft w/Ferrite Cores (Gold Plated)" costs <a href="http://www.monoprice.com/products/product.asp?c_id=102&amp;cp_id=10231&amp;cs_id=1023104&amp;p_id=2404&amp;seq=1&amp;format=2">just $3.56</a>. That is a huge difference in price! You save more than $45 buying from MonoPrice. (Yes, I do realize you'll need to figure in the shipping &amp; handling costs but you'll still come out way ahead!)</p>
<p><strong>Digital is Digital</strong> Another factoid that needs to be out in the open is this: all digital cables are about the same. Cables with endings such as DVI, HDMI, DisplayPort, etc. are digital cables and you don't need to get a Monster cable or a Dynex cable for more than 10x the price. On the other hand you should spend a bit more money on analog cables. An example would be a VGA-to-VGA cable, which is an analog cable. Unless you have old monitors and TVs (which I do!) most of you won't even need to bother with analog cables.</p>
<p><strong>TV Cables Too</strong> On the TV side the same logic applies. Get the best component, composite, S-Video cables you can afford. But don't even think about paying more than about $5 for a HDMI-to-HDMI cable. Let's look at another example.</p>
<p>The "Rocketfish - 8' HDMI Digital Audio/Video Cable for PlayStation 3" costs <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=8989614&amp;st=hdmi&amp;type=product&amp;id=1218008592045">$69.99 at Best Buy</a>. At MonoPrice the "High Speed HDMI 1.3a Category 2 Certified Cable 28AWG - 8ft w/Ferrite Cores (Gold Plated Connectors) - BLACK" costs <a href="http://www.monoprice.com/products/product.asp?c_id=102&amp;cp_id=10243&amp;cs_id=1024008&amp;p_id=4958&amp;seq=1&amp;format=2">just $4.02</a>. The Rocketfish-branded cable costs more than 17x! By the way, don't get carried away by that "for PlayStation 3" marketing text--you can use any HDMI cable to connect your PlayStation 3 to a digital TV with a HDMI connection.</p>
<p>Save yourself a boatload of money by buying your cables at MonoPrice!</p>
