<li> Writing hand-written notes.</li>
<li>Drawing precision things.</li></ol></blockquote></p>
<p>We can glide our fingers on the iPad's solid glass surface. The icons and every element of the UI are precisely designed for our fingers. A stylus in this iPad experience is an intrusion.</p>
<p>But what if the display instead of being solid glass has a bit more friction, a little indentation when you press on it, and the UI is designed to be sensitive to the angle and pressure of a stylus so you can take hand-written notes and doodle like you would with a real pencil and paper? A stylus in <em>this</em> experience would be absolutely essential.</p>
