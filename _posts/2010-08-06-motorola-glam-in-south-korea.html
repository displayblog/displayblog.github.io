<p>Motorola's Glam launched on August 4th in South Korea. The Glam is an Android 2.1 smartphone sporting a 3.7-inch LCD with a 854x480 pixel format. The LCD used in the Glam seems to be the same that is used on the Droid and Motoroi. From <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/07/10/sktelecom-motorola-xt720-motoroi-review-3-7-inch-ips-android-2-1-smartphone-in-south-korea/">my limited experience of the Motoroi</a> I can say without reservation that the display is fantastic. Note DisplayMate awarded the Motorola Droid the <a href="http://www.displaymate.com/best.html">DisplayMate Best Video Hardware Guide</a> Award for both smartphone and the entire mobile display category. check out the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/04/06/motorola-droid-vs-google-nexus-one/">review of the Droid</a> for a lot of detailed display info. </p>
<p>Other specs include: dual LED flash, a five megapixel camera, Bluetooth 2.1+EDR, a 3.5-mm headphone jack, USB 2.0 connectivity (a microUSB I presume), GPS. SK Telecom is the carrier of choice and should be available at the end of August. <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/08/04/motorola-glam-brings-android-2-1-plenty-of-ritz-to-south-korea/">Engadget</a></p>
