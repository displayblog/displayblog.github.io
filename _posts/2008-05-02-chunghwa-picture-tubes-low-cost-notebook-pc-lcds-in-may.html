<p>Chunghwa Picture Tubes (CPT) is expected to volume manufacture and ship low-cost notebook PC LCD panels starting in May. The low-cost notebook PC LCD segment will comprise 13% of CPT's Q2'08 shipments according to SC Lin, VP of Small/Medium TFT at CPT. In 2H'08 the share of low-cost notebook PC panel shipments will reach 30% of small/medium LCD. About 1.5 million low-cost notebook PC panels are expected to ship per quarter. CPT has a G4.5 LCD fab that can cut 36 7" panels or 18 8.9" panels. SC Lin also noted that 8.9" and 10" segments are becoming the mainstream sizes for low-cost notebook PCs. CPT will shift 80% of its G4.5 capacity to small/medium LCDs. Currently the small/medium portion is 60% and will increase to 75% in Q3'08.</p>
<p>What does this mean? If CPT's shipment expectations are simply meeting the demands of low-cost notebook PC LCDs by companies such as ASUS for its Eee PC notebook PCs, then this isn't much news. However, if CPT can cause a slight oversupply of these panels, then we can expect 8.9" and 10" LCD prices to drop and hopefully that will translate into even more affordable low-cost notebook PCs.</p>
