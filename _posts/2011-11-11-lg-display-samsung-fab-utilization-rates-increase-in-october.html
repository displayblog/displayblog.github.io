<blockquote><p>The uptick in October fab loading rates mainly came from Korean panel makers, who increased loading to 84-85%, aiming to fulfill demand in October (the peak month in the year). The increase mainly stemmed from TV panel production to meet increased LCD TV orders for fourth-quarter 2011, especially for Samsung. In addition, both LG Display and Samsung are increasing shipments to Chinese customers, with consecutive monthly shipment growth in November and December.</blockquote></p>
<p>Deborah Yang, DisplaySearch:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is a risk of oversupply as loading rates are based on panel makers' sales targets and on optimistic expectations rather than on a realistic demand forecast. A decline in large-area panel shipments is forecast for December 2011 and January 2012, as the holiday demand will already have been met.</blockquote></p>
