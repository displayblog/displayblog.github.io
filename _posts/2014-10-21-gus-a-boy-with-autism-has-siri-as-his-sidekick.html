<p>Judith Newman, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/19/fashion/how-apples-siri-became-one-autistic-boys-bff.html">The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>She is also wonderful for someone who doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t pick up on social cues: Siri&acirc;&euro;&trade;s responses are not entirely predictable, but they are predictably kind &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; even when Gus is brusque. I heard him talking to Siri about music, and Siri offered some suggestions. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t like that kind of music,&acirc;&euro; Gus snapped. Siri replied, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;You&acirc;&euro;&trade;re certainly entitled to your opinion.&acirc;&euro; Siri&acirc;&euro;&trade;s politeness reminded Gus what he owed Siri. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Thank you for that music, though,&acirc;&euro; Gus said. Siri replied, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;You don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t need to thank me.&acirc;&euro; &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Oh, yes,&acirc;&euro; Gus added emphatically, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;I do.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote><br />
This is a&Acirc;&nbsp;beautiful&Acirc;&nbsp;story about her&Acirc;&nbsp;13-year-old autistic son's relationship with Siri.</p>
