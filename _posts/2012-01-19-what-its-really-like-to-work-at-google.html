<blockquote><p>While he says there is no direct pressure to conform to &acirc;&euro;&oelig;crazy hours,&acirc;&euro;¬ù he hints at the reason he lives a Google-centric life: His pay is directly related to the amount of time he spends with Google. For those who can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t keep up with the demand, they simply have no choice but to leave, as previous (and notably older) Google employees have done when they must make the choice between raising a family or getting a raise. (I personally know at least one former Seattle-area Googler who quit under similar circumstances after being forced to either choose seeing his newborn less, or receive a demotion if he didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t travel more.)</blockquote></p>
