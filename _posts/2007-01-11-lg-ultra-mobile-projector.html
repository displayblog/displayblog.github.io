<p>LG Electronics' Ultra Mobile Projector is in the "pocket projector" class having a very compact size and the ability to use battery power. LG claims its Ultra Mobile Projector is the brightest commercially available pocket projector and delivers 100 lumens thanks to Luminus Devices' PhlatLight PT39 chipset. Typical pocket projectors have a brightness of only 15 - 30 lumens, so the Ultra Mobile Projector is many times brighter and can be used in daylight with a large image that has good color and image quality. Unlike large projectors, pocket projectors like the Ultra Mobile Projector use LEDs that enable a compact size, very long lifetimes and the capability to be turned on instantly.</p>
