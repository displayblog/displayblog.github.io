<p>HP's LP2465 is a 24" wide LCD monitor with 1920 x 1200 resolution: 16:10 aspect ratio, 13ms pixel response time, 6ms Gray-To-Gray (GTG) response time, 178-degree viewing angle, 1000:1 contrast ratio and 500 cd/m2. The cheapest price for the LP2465 is around $750 w/o shipping and handling. But that seems way too expensive considering a 22" wide LCD monitor albeit with less resolution will be at least $350 cheaper. Heck, I'd take two 22" wide LCD monitors. For instance, <a href="http://displayblog.wordpress.com/2006/07/30/acer-al2216w-22-wide-lcd-monitor/">Acer's AL2216W</a> is about $400 retail in the US.</p>

The LP2465 has some good features though (not enough to warrant the great big price however): dual DVI inputs, upstream USB port, and four downstream USB ports. Actually, I don't like cables dangling from my monitor, so let's scratch that from the "good feature" list. Response time is a decent 6ms GTG and will allow you to enjoy most 3D games without experiencing too much motion blur. Dell's Ultrasharp 2407WFP is a much better value (same panel source: Samsung) but with video input that allows you to hook up your PlayStation 2, DVD player or other video sources.</p>
