<p>Steve Jobs in 1985 via <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/steve-jobs-gets-his-head-shaved-and-other-youthful-stories-early-playboy-interview/70556">Cult of Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you look at the mainframe market place, there&acirc;&euro;&trade;s been virtually zero innovation since IBM got dominant control of that market place 15 years ago. They are going to do the same thing in every other sector of the computer market place if they can get away with it. The IBM PC fundamentally brought no new technology to the industry at all. It was just repackaging and slight extension of Apple II technology, and they want it all. They absolutely want it all. This market place is coming down to the two of us, whether we like it or not. I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t particularly like it, but it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s coming down to Apple and IBM.</blockquote></p>
<p>25 years later the personal computer market is about the same: IBM PC-compatibles versus Apple Macs. There is one little difference with the tablet category busting a move thanks to the iPad.</p>
