<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/05/31wwdc.html">Apple</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple CEO Steve Jobs and a team of Apple executives will kick off the company&acirc;&euro;&trade;s annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) with a keynote address on Monday, June 6 at 10:00 a.m. At the keynote, Apple will unveil its next generation software &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Lion, the eighth major release of Mac OS X; iOS 5, the next version of Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s advanced mobile operating system which powers the iPad, iPhone and iPod touch; and iCloud, Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s upcoming cloud services offering.</blockquote></p>
<p>OS X Lion, iOS 5, and iCloud. I know iOS 5 will be a free upgrade for iPhone users. OS X Lion will be a fairly affordable upgrade through the App Store. iCloud, now this is a mystery. What kind of services will it bring?</p>
<p>Will iCloud just be an online locker for videos, podcasts, music, ebooks, apps, etc.? Will it compete with Google and offer free email, calendar, a RSS reader, a blogging service, online phone number (voicemail, texting, transcription), iWork online, etc. and sync them all with your OS X Lion-equipped Mac and iOS 5-updated iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad? I hope Apple offers all of this and even more, including a live-stream of the keynote.</p>
<p>I'm getting pretty excited.</p>
