<p><a href="http://news.mk.co.kr/english/newsRead.php?rss=Y&sc=30800011&year=2012&no=185020">Seung-hwan Jeong and Ha&acirc;&euro;&trade;eun Bang, Maeil Business Newspaper</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>South Korea&acirc;&euro;&trade;s tech major LG Electronics is set to launch the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s first 55-inch OLED (organic light-emitting diode) TVs in May this year. Prices of the OLED TVs will be set at approximately nine million won ($7,928.91), and the OLED TV will be unveiled in Cannes, France where a movie premier will be held. LG aims to take the lead in the OLED TV market by launching OLED TVs ahead of its rivals.</blockquote></p>
<p>Rivals? As in plural? Probably not. The only rival at the moment is Samsung. The two are using vastly different OLED implementations with Samsung using a typical RGB OLED structure and LG using <a href="/2012/01/09/woled/">WOLED</a>. US$8000 is a lot of money for a 55-inch OLED TV, but I thought it would have been more expensive.</p>
