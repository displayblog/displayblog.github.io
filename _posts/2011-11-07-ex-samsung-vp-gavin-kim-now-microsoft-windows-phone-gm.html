<blockquote><p>I will be responsible to help set the future direction for the Windows Phone platform and to accelerate Microsoft&acirc;&euro;&trade;s trajectory to win the hearts and minds of consumers, carriers, device manufacturers, developers and partners. In my experience, there is an already fervent base of Windows Phone supporters out there and they all get it. They are passionate, and already very vocal about it &acirc;&euro;&brvbar; so, it is really my new job to make sure we reflect that message clearly in our product and marketing collaborations with all of our partners to create more Windows Phone believers.</blockquote></p>
