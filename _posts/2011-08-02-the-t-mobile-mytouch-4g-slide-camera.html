<p>Myriam Joire, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/08/02/t-mobile-mytouch-4g-slide-review/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[...] HTC designed a completely new camera module using a backside-illuminated 8 megapixel sensor combined with a quality 3.69mm 1:2.2 wide-angle autofocus lens. [...] That being said, we're pretty excited about the dedicated two-stage machined aluminum shutter key, which feels wonderful and provides just the right amount of resistance -- it's better than the N8's. Of course, if you prefer leaving fingerprints all over the viewfinder the camera also includes touch-to-focus along with an onscreen shutter key.</blockquote></p>
<p>Why would any self-respecting product designer allow "8.0 MEGAPIXEL CAMERA" to be tatted on the back of the smartphone?</p>
<p>Are smartphone manufacturers serious about improving photographic capabilities? If they really are they should get off the megapixel bandwagon.</p>
<p>Instead of cramming more pixels into the image sensor, the focus should be on getting more light to each pixel, which should be getting bigger not smaller.</p>
