<p><a href="http://www.trustedreviews.com/digital-cameras/review/2010/11/04/Samsung-WB2000/p1">Trusted Reviews</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The monitor is of particular interest. It is a 7.6cm AMOLED screen with a resolution of 640 x 480, or 306,000 pixels. It is exceptionally clear and bright with superb colour rendition, and a very wide angle of view in all directions.</blockquote></p>
<p>7.6cm = 3 inches. OLED displays generally have a difficult time in bright ambient environments so I would make sure and test to see if the 3-inch AMOLED's performance in the sun is acceptable to you. Trusted Reviews reports excellent high ISO performance, sold build quality, and the ability to capture Full HD video. The WB2000 looks like its an overall winner. Bonus: the two analog battery and memory indicators are retro-cool.</p>
