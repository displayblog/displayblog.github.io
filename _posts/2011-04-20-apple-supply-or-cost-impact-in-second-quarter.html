<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-20/apple-reliance-on-japan-puts-sales-at-risk-as-part-prices-climb.html">Bloomberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Japanese earthquake and tsunami will probably weigh on Apple Inc. (AAPL)&acirc;&euro;&trade;s forecasts for third-quarter profit, sales and gross margin because of higher component prices and disrupted manufacturing, analysts said.</p>
<p>At least seven analysts expect the disaster to affect the company&acirc;&euro;&trade;s outlook later today.</blockquote></p>
<p>Who are these seven analysts? And why were they so wrong?</p>
<p><a href="http://venturebeat.com/2011/04/20/slow-ipad-sales/">MobileBeat</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>COO Tim Cook also dispelled assumptions that the Japanese earthquake had anything to do with Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s iPad supply trouble, saying on the call that the company &acirc;&euro;&oelig;did not have any supply or cost impact&acirc;&euro; over the last three months. Cook went on to say that Apple will &acirc;&euro;&oelig;produce a very large number [of iPads] for the quarter,&acirc;&euro; but he&acirc;&euro;&trade;s still unsure if that will meet consumer demand.</blockquote></p>
<p>From how Cook worded his response, I think Apple may have a supply or cost impact going forward.</p>
