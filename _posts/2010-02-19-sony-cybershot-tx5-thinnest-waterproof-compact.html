<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Sony_Cybershot_TX5_Waterproof_10MP_Compact_Digital_Camera.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9706 aligncenter" title="Sony_Cybershot_TX5_Waterproof_10MP_Compact_Digital_Camera" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Sony_Cybershot_TX5_Waterproof_10MP_Compact_Digital_Camera.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="319" /></a></p><br />
The Cybershot TX5 from Sony is just 17.7-mm thick and adds to that slim profile a lot of proofs: waterproof (down to 3m), dust-proof, shock-proof (can be dropped from a height of 1.5m), and freeze-proof (chilled to -10&Acirc;&deg;C). A 10MP Exmor R CMOS image sensor coupled with the BIONZ processor enable 10fps continuous shooting and very good performance in low ambient light conditions. Unfortunately, there have been some reviews that show the Exmor R not doing as well as Canon compacts in bright conditions; the reviews state less sharpness.</p>
<p>The TX5 can shoot 720p movies, features 4x optical zoom and makes use of a fairly large 3-inch resistive touch TFT LCD. That means you can use the display with your gloves on, unlike an iPhone (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/02/11/iphone-sausage-as-stylus/">iPhone: Sausage as Stylus</a></em>). All 2010 Cyber-shot models, including the TX5, can take SD/SDHC in addition to Memory Stick cards. But what is most impressive is the ruggedness of the TX5 in such a pretty package. You'll have to wait until the end of March 2010 but that's at least a couple of months before you'll need to pack the TX5 for a fun time at the beach.
