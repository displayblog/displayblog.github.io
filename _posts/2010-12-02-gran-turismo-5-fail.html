<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2010/12/the-failure-of-gran-turismo-5-the-power-of-menus-and-ui.ars">Ars Technica</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Animations you can't skip, long loading times, and too many button presses and menus to navigate before you can actually race... all these things add up to a frustrating and inefficient menu system. This may not be enough to kill the game&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;reviews and sales seem to be mostly positive so far, but you should never feel frustrated or kept away from the gameplay by the interface. If you quit your session because you don't feel like wrestling with the menus before the next race, the game has failed.</blockquote></p>
<p>The user interface frustrates the user experience. Unfortunate.</p>
