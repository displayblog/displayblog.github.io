<blockquote><p>The Envy x2's 11.6-inch IPS display offers a 1366 x 768 pixel resolution and made a strong impression during our (admittedly limited) hands-on time, serving up bright, crisp images despite the room's overly enthusiastic fluorescent lighting.</blockquote></p>
<p>The 400-nit 135-ppi IPS LCD is quite bright, and is more than competitive with the <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6063/macbook-air-13inch-mid-2012-review/3">375-nit Samsung LTH133BT01A03-based mid-2011 11.6-inch MacBook Air</a>. One big difference is the ENVY X2 sports an IPS LCD while the MacBook Air doesn't. But maybe I'm comparing apples to oranges. Maybe I should be comparing the ENVY X2 to the iPad with a third-party keyboard, like the <a href="http://http://www.thebrydge.com/">Brydge</a>. Then it becomes clear how inferior the ENVY X2's 11.6-inch IPS LCD is to the 2048x1536 9.7-inch IPS LCD in the iPad.</p>
