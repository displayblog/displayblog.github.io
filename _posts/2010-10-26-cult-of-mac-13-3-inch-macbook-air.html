<p><a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/13-inch-macbook-air-is-a-surprisingly-powerful-and-portable-pro-replacement-review/65814">Cult of Mac</a>'s David Martin on the 13.3-inch MacBook Air:</p>
<blockquote><p>The screen is every bit of what I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d expect from an Apple notebook. No surprises here except for the fact that the 13-inch MacBook Air has the same resolution as the 15-inch MacBook Pro. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s glossy, which many people don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t like, but I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve gotten used to it.</blockquote></p>
<p>The new 13.3-inch MacBook Air has a pixel format of 1440x900. The 15.4-inch MacBook Pro can be equipped with either 1440x900 or 1680x1050. Engadget's Joshua Topolsky (read <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/10/26/engadget-2010-macbook-air/"><em>Engadget: 2010 MacBook Air</em></a>) mentioned an anti-reflective coating that helps with the gloss and makes the new MacBook Air notebooks more like the Air of old.</p>
