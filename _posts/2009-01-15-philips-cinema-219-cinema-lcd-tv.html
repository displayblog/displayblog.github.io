<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=philips">Philips</a> Cinema 21:9 line of LCD TVs are ultra-wide and sport an aspect ratio of 21:9, perfect for those who watch film. The 21:9 aspect ratio is very close to the human visual system that has roughly a 2:1 aspect ratio and is the reason why we get such a full visual experience when watching film at the theaters. Philips is right to claim that its Cinema 21:9 is the world's first cinema-proportioned LCD TV.</p>
<p>While at CES and after looking at <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sony">Sony</a>'s <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=vaio-p">VAIO P</a> ultraportable notebook PC that has roughly a 2:1 aspect ratio with its <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=8"">8"</a> LCD, I was bouncing off just this idea to John, a good friend of mine. It is good to know that someone out there was thinking outside of the box and I look forward to more LCD TV brands coming out with cinema proportioned versions. It would be great to see ultra-wide LCDs integrated into multimedia LCD monitors and notebook PCs as well.</p>
