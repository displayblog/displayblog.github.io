<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=au-optronics">AU Optronics</a> (AUO) is the largest <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-manufacturer">LCD manufacturer</a> in Taiwan and one of the largest in the world but even the largest cannot go unaffected by a global decline in demand for LCD goods. AUO will be reducing its worldwide workforce by 2% or 700 employees starting in January 2009. AUO employs about 38,000 workers on a global basis.&Acirc;&nbsp;The company stressed that workforce adjustments are conducted annually. I am sure the workforce reduction is a direct result of the expected anouncement of poor results for Q4'08.</p>
<p>Other Taiwan-based companies such as <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=chi-mei-optoelectronics">Chi Mei Optoelectronics</a> (CMO) and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=wintek">Wintek</a> have reduced their workforce as well. CMO recently received urgent orders for LCD TV panels that will give a much-needed boost to its LCD fab utilization rates, which were just 20% - 30% in November and December. The urgent order will bring utilization rates close to 50%. With inventory drying up any large bump in expected demand will result in emergency LCD panel orders.</p>
<p>With LCD fab utilizations at just 60% in Q4'08 and entering into a seasonally weak first half, AUO as well as other LCD manufacturers are in for a bumpy ride.</p>
