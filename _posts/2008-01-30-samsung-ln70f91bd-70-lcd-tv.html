<p>This is Samsung's largest LCD TV at 70" that I could find on Samsung Korea's website that is available for sale right now. It has all the features that hint at a brilliant picture. The only thing that I am not sure of is whether it features 120Hz or not. The 5ms response time should be quite fast but without 120Hz you will still experience some motion blur. The LED backlight has local dimming capability that generates an astounding contrast ratio of 500,000:1. Wow. The design is nice and simple with a piano black glossy finish, which is a nice touch. Unlike other designs that I saw at CES, I don't see any possibility of big blue lights pulsating, which would be a really big distraction when you're trying to enjoy a movie. The price? If you need to ask...</p>
