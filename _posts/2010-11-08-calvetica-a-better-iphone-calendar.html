<p>One of the reasons why I continue to read <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/11/08/calvetica">Daring Fireball</a> is that John Gruber has a knack for identifying the simple and elegant. This time it is a calendar app for the iPhone: <a href="http://calvetica.com/index.html">Calvetica</a> from Mysterious Trousers. The minimalist, elegant interface is much appreciated. When I accidentally oriented my iPhone in landscape I was pleasantly surprised with an informative week view. The default Calendar app feels clumsy in comparison. Well worth the $2.99. There is also a free version you can try out.</p>
