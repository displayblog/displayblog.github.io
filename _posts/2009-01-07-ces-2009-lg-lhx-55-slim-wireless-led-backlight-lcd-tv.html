<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lg">LG</a> announced its LHX LCD TV. The LHX comes in one size: <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=55"">55"</a>. The 55" LHX sports one of the best LCD panels out there: <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=super-ips">Super IPS</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=in-plane-switching">In-Plane Switching</a>). As far as I know color fidelity on the Super IPS LCD panels are superb. The IPS panel is illuminated by a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led-backlight">LED backlight</a> and paired with <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=local-dimming">local dimming</a> technology generates an amazing 2,000,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio. Not only that the 240Hz frequency should completely obliterate any motion blur. The 1080/24p capable HDMI connections (there are four) will make sure films look fantastic. I am not sure how slim it is but will guess that it is really thin. I will have to find out for sure tomorrow when I get my hands on one. The wireless feature hasn't been detailed but I am guessing that it will have some sort of wireless HD connectivity that will make it all the more amazing when you put the LHX on the wall with just one cable (power) coming out of it.</p>
