<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/01/30/speirs-future-shock">Daring Fireball</a>: I have often shared with my friends that the Mac just lets me get my work done. The PC, on the other hand, forces me to work on <em>it</em>. I think the iPad will push this distinction a bit further. Fraser Speirs comments on the iPad's impact on doing work in his piece, "<a href="http://speirs.org/blog/2010/1/29/future-shock.html">Future Shock</a>":</p>
<blockquote><p>Think of the millions of hours of human effort spent on preventing and recovering from the problems caused by completely open computer systems. Think of the lengths that people have gone to in order to acquire skills that are orthogonal to their core interests and their job, just so they can get their job done.</p>
<p>If the iPad and its successor devices free these people to focus on what they do best, it will dramatically change people's perceptions of computing from something to fear to something to engage enthusiastically with.</blockquote></p>
