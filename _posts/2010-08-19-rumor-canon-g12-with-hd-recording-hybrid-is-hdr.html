<p>Just like the new Canon S95 there is a rumor: the Canon G12. Expected features include those already announced in the S95: HD recording (probably 720p), Hybrid IS and HDR. <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/08/19/canons-powershot-g12-leaks-out-promises-hd-video-mode/">Engadget</a></p>
