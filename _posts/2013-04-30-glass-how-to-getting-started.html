<p><a href="http://youtu.be/4EvNxWhskf8">Project Glass on YouTube</a>: Google posted up an introductory video explaining the basics of Glass. I believe one of the main advantages of Google Glass is hands-free: You no longer need your hands to do a lot of the things you did on a smartphone. The touch UI looks fairly intuitive to me, except that I have to wear a pair of geeky glasses, tap and rub its temple. I don't want to be tapping and rubbing the Google Glass temple; I'd rather be tapping and rubbing the display on my smartphone. If I ever get over the geekiness, this is what I want to be doing instead: "Glass, take a photo. And send it to Flickr."</p>
