<p>Keith Peters took a Veho VMS004 DELUXE USB-powered microscope and took a close look at the displays found in the Kindle (E Ink) and the iPad (IPS TFT LCD). The Kindle's E Ink display at 400x magnification looks almost organic as if made of small minerals or rocks. Source: <a href="http://www.bit-101.com/blog/?p=2722">BIT-101</a></p>
