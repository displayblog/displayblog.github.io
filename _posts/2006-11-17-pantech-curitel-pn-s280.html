<p>Pantech Curitel's PN-S280 aka PT-K2800 has a 1.3 mp digicam, a 240 x 320 QVGA LCD and has touch controls. LG's Chocolate phone's touch controls started it all. The phones don't look too bad, but from where I am sitting, the phones seem to be on the chubby side. Of course, as usual, the Koreans have yet again garnered the help from a beautiful women to market their techno-gadgets. BTW, there must be some magic involved because it would be very difficult to stand a slider on your hands as shown in the picture!</p>
