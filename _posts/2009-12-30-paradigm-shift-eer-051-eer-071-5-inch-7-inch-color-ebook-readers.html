<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/12/31/paradigm-shift-intros-5-and-7-inch-readers-with-color-lcd-dis/">Engadget</a>: Paradigm Shift's EER-051 and EER-071 ebook readers are based on low-energy consumption 5-inch and 7-inch LCDs, respectively. Both ereaders are expected to ship in February via Delstar for US$149.95 for the EER-051 and $199.95 for the EER-071.</p>
<p>Do we need an ebook reader that lasts a week? Are we willing to sacrifice color? The answer seems to be yes and yes for a lot of folks looking at how the Kindle has sold. But for me, it's no and no. All I need is about 24 hours--about the time I would need to get to a power outlet even when I'm out and about. Color? Absolutely, because I want to read but not just black and white text.</p>
