According to Apple, there are 200+ new features in Aperture 3. I'll just mention four:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faces: Face detection and recognition.</li>
<li>Places: Able to pluck location data from photos.</li>
<li>Brushes: Nondestructive edge-aware retouch.</li>
<li>Adjustment Presets: Professional and custom imaging effects.</li><br />
</ul><br />
You can also create slideshows with photos, HD video, titles and layered soundtracks. Interesting how Apple is fusing capabilities from Garageband and iMovie. I hope we, as an industry, are moving toward a software concept that involves a blank canvas that comes with the basics and purchasing only the functions that we need. Oh, finally! Aperture 3 recognizes RAW files from the S90. Source: <a href="http://www.apple.com/aperture/">Apple</a></p>
