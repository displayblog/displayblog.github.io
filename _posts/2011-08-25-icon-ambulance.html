<p>Voicemail: Vic, can you call me at home? I have something urgent to discuss.</p>
<p>Vic: Hey Steve - this is Vic. I'm sorry I didn't answer your call earlier. I was in religious services, and the caller ID said unknown, so I didn't pick up.</p>
<p>Steve: Vic, unless the Caller ID said 'GOD', you should never pick up during services.</p>
<p>Nervous laughter.</p>
<p>Steve: So Vic, we have an urgent issue, one that I need addressed right away. I've already assigned someone from my team to help you, and I hope you can fix this tomorrow.</p>
