<blockquote><p>In terms of performance, the AOC comes down right in the middle of the road. The lag is a little bit too high for hard core gamers, though I found it to be acceptable for casual gaming myself. The color gamut is also probably too limited for people that need it for editing photos professionally, as it can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t quite encompass the full sRGB colorspace, though the average and median Delta E values were more than acceptable. However, as a general purpose monitor for doing work I found the AOC to do a very good job of that. The matte screen means you won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be dealing with reflections in a lit room, but you will be limited on adjustments due to the design of the stand.</blockquote></p>
<p>A 23-inch 1920x1080 e-IPS LCD monitor for around US$200. Not bad at all.</p>
