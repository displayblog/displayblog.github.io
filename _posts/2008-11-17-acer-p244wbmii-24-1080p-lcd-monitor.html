<p><a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;u=http://www.acer.co.jp/products/monitor/p244wbmii/">Acer Japan</a>: 1080p LCD monitors are in fashion! Acer's P244Wbmii (interesting model name) is a 24-inch LCD monitor with a 16:9 aspect ratio. Pixel format is 1920x1080, exactly what you will find in most largish LCD TVs. The P244Wbmii sports  TN TFT LCD and that's why you'll see two things: not-go-great viewing angles at 170/160 but super-fast response times at 2ms. I think Acer is targeting computer users that like to work, play and watch movies. Why do I say that? Gallery after the jump.</p>
<p>There are two HDMI ports. One for the gaming console (PS3 or Xbox 360) and the other for the PC (most likely you'll need a DVI-to-HDMI cable if the P244Wbmii doesn't come with one). There is also a VGA port for those who have yet to upgrade to DVI or HDMI sporting graphics cards.</p>
