<p>I was strolling my little one around this morning and trying to read my emails on my <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=iphone">iPhon</a>e. At the same time. Yes, I know, I should be watching where I go, but I was strolling inside the home, so there weren't any traffic to watch out for. Safety: check, even with just one hand. I only had one hand left to maneuver the iPhone and in particular scroll. It wasn't impossible, but very difficult to do with just one hand to say the least. </p>

<p>So, I got to thinking: "The iPhone has a 3D <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=accelerometer">accelerometer</a>. I should be able to just tilt the iPhone to scroll!" Apple, I hope you're working on it.</p>
