<p>Acer introduced five new LCD monitors in the US. I would like to concentrate on the 24" wide LCD monitor, the x241Wsd. It has a pixel format of 1920 x 1200, enough to view Full HD 1080p video content, a contrast ratio of 1000:1, a brightness of 400 cd/m2 and a response time of 5ms. The external design is ok but is nothing to write home about: I think some of Dell's new monitor designs actually look better than this, which is saying a lot about how average this Acer looks from the picture.</p>

<p>The 22" version (x221Wsd) sports a 1680 x 1050 pixel format that is really good for nothing when it comes to video. That pixel format isn't all that useful for two-page mode either since each page has only 840 x 1050 pixels. The only useful tool is Excel as you get many more columns to work with. The best, in my humble opinion, is to get 1920 x 1200. Full HD video, two-page (960 x 1200, not ideal, but better than most), and tons of columns in Excel. The x241Wsd is priced right at $600.</p>
