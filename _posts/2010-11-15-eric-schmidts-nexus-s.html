<blockquote><p>Well, it's exceptionally thin -- we weren't able to compare, but we'd say it's at least comparable with an iPhone 4 if not slimmer still -- and it's thinner in the middle than at either end, giving it a mildly concave profile. There's a glossy plastic bezel up front housing an AMOLED screen, a pair of discrete volume buttons on the left side, and a black plastic back [...] which seemed too roughly manufactured to be anything but a prototype.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Gingerbread "screen off" animation is downright cool. Eric Schmidt's Nexus S turned off like that according to Engadget. I wonder if there'd be an app for that on the iPhone...</p>
