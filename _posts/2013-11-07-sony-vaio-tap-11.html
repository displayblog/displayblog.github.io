<blockquote><p>The Tap 11&acirc;&euro;&trade;s 11.6-inch, 1920 x 1080 display features Sony&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/16/3881546/sonys-new-triluminous-tvs-pursue-vibrant-hues-with-quantum-dots">Triluminos technology</a>, first found in its TVs before making its way into devices like the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/4/4395926/sony-vaio-pro-review-were-going-to-war-with-the-macbook-air">Vaio Pro</a> and the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/products/xperia-z-ultra/7182">Xperia Z Ultra</a>. The screen looks great, with solid viewing angles and bright, accurate colors. It packs plenty of pixels, and high-resolution screens are a must on a tablet, but the Tap 11 suffers from the same resolution ailments as the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/4/4395926/sony-vaio-pro-review-were-going-to-war-with-the-macbook-air">11-inch Vaio Pro</a> &mdash; a significant part of the operating system renders way too small.</blockquote></p>
<p>What's so fantastic about a display if you can't easily view and experience the fantastic-ness. Microsoft needs to make it easy for average users to change DPI settings. Hmmm... that sounded like an oxymoron. Average users should not need to change DPI settings. The solution: Sony needs to set optimal DPI settings for the average user.</p>
