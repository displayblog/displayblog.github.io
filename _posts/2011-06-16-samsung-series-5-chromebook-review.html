<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/16/technology/personaltech/16pogue.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all">David Pogue</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Truth is, considering how stripped-down the Samsung is, you have to wonder why it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s as big, heavy and expensive as it is. You can find plenty of full-blown Windows laptops with the same price, weight and size.</p>
<p>Maybe the Chromebook concept would fly if it cost $180 instead of $500. Maybe it makes more sense if you rent it (students and corporations can lease Chromebooks for $20 to $30 a month). Maybe it will fly once this country gets free coast-to-coast 4G cellular Internet, which should be just after hell freezes over.</p>
<p>For now, though, you should praise Google for its noble experiment. You should thrill to the possibilities of the online future. You should exult that somebody&acirc;&euro;&trade;s trying to shake up the operating system wars.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/06/16/pogue-chromebook">John Gruber</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Really? Why? Would everyone have praised Apple for its &acirc;&euro;&oelig;noble experiment&acirc;&euro; if the $500 iPad had been too big and heavy, felt like it was worth only $180, and was &acirc;&euro;&oelig;a 3.3-pound paperweight&acirc;&euro; when offline?</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple has changed how experimenting is done: do it exceptionally well the very first time. No company has a perfect record, including Apple, but it seems the Samsung Series 5 Chromebook would have been better if it was thinner, lighter, and less expensive. At least that's what I'm hearing from Pogue and Gruber.</p>
<p>As for being offline, I'm almost always online, but not being able to do anything when offline is, well, off-putting.</p>
