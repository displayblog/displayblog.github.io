<p>I have multiple sources for photographs: iPhone, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, two canon point-and-shoots, and two scanners. I've amassed roughly 50,000 photographs since  cameras became digital. I've tried Picasa and iPhoto to manage them, but I felt a huge barrier between me and my photos, in particular the digital files themselves. I know Apple wants me no longer to worry about such things, but it's a need of mine: I <em>need</em> direct access to my files. So, this is my routine:</p>
<ol>
<li>Image Capture and/or other image capturing tool: Bring all images into the Pictures folder.</li>
<li>Structurer: An amazing tool that let's me make a ton directories like <em>that</em>. I make as many directories as needed depending on the dates of the photographs. The structure of the directory is YYYY_MM_DD.</li>
<li>Then I move them to two Lacie external drives. I quickly move them off of my MacBook Pro because storage is precious on the 50GB SSD.</li><br />
</ol><br />
This ritual takes time especially when there's hundreds of photographs involved. Structurer helps a great deal, but still. Yesterday I was introduced to Hazel, a Paul Kim masterpiece in ritual automation. Immediately I went to work to see if I could automate any of those three steps.</p>

<p>This process is applied to the Pictures directory so to the left you see Pictures. And then to the right you see an Organize Photos rule that I created.</p>

<p>What you see above are the details of my new rule Organize Photos. I started off by telling Hazel, "In the Pictures folder do whatever I'm going to tell you to files that start with IMG_ and DSC_." Then I told Hazel, "Create subfolders based on the dates of those files and stick them in there."</p>

<p>The folder pattern can be customized and that's exactly what I did: YYYY_MM_DD. So from now on Hazel automatically generates subfolders using the YYYY_MM_DD pattern and puts all the photos that were created on that date into the subfolders. This is just one of many things Hazel can do. Magic.</p>
<p>Hazel is US$25. Just having my photos automatically sorted exactly the way I want them to be is worth the price. <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php">Get yourself a copy of Hazel</a>, automate your computing rituals, and save yourself a ton of precious time.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.03.07:</em> Paul Kim, Chief Noodler at Noodlesoft, wrote in. The very last step that I explain where I customize the folder pattern involves a small right arrow (can be seen in the screen shot), the folder separator, which is not necessary:</p>
<blockquote><p>... the folder separator at the start is unnecessary since it's assumed it'll create that first level for you.</blockquote></p>
