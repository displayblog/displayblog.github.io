<p>Starting June 18th almost every webOS app is 50% off until July 9th as posted on <a href="http://blog.palm.com/palm/2010/06/its-half-time-in-the-palm-webos-app-catalog-.html">The Official Palm Blog</a>. Upgrades are included. Oh, and it seems Palm is continuing to ignore its international Pre and Pixi users: this clearance sale is limited to US customers only. I wonder what is happening on July 10th.</p>
