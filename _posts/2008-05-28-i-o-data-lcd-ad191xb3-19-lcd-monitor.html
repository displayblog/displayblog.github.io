<p>Most likely the I-O Data LCD-AD191XB3 will go for much much less than $360 in the US, if it gets here. The LCD-AD191XB3 is a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=19"">19"</a> wide LCD monitor with the usual pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1440-x-900">1440 x 900</a>. I think there is an opportunity for all manufacturers of 19" wide <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-monitor">LCD monitor</a>s to offer an upgraded 1680 x 1050 version, similar to what <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/05/27/viewsonic-vx1962wm-19-lcd-monitor/">Viewsonic did with its VX1962WM</a>. There is really nothing special about the LCD-AD191XB3 with ho-hum specifications. The high price is a deal-killer, but I think the price will be quite aggressive at sub-$200 in the US. And at that price, the LCD-AD191XB3 could compete as the entry-level 19" LCD monitor to look at if all you want is a workable 19" wide LCD monitor.</p>
