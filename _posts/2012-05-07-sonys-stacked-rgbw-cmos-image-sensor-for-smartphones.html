<p><a href="http://www.petapixel.com/2012/05/07/newer-smartphones-packing-cmos-sensors-with-dedicated-white-pixel">DL Cade, PetPixel</a>: The Sony LT29i codenamed Hayabusa will sport a 13 megapixel CMOS image sensor with stacked RGBW pixels and HDR movie capture. By stacking pixels you get larger pixels without making the sensor bigger&mdash;a good thing when space is a premium. RGBW adds a white pixel for better low light performance, but getting accurate colors might be tricky.</p>
