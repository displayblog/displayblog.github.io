<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/08/toshiba-libretto-w105-review/">Engadget</a> on Toshiba's Libretto W105:</p>
<blockquote><p>Obviously, the Libretto W105's heart and soul is its dual seven-inch, 1,024 x 600-resolution LCDs. The glossy screens are shockingly glossy, which makes the device nearly impossible to use in the sunlight. Not that the iPad is any better, but looking at the bottom screen on a sunny day was like looking into a black hole. The viewing angles of both displays are actually decent for a regular laptop, but not good enough for a tablet device like this. What do we mean by that? Well, sharing the screen with a friend on an airplane was adequate, but when we sat back from the device while it was in laptop mode we couldn't make out the letters on the keyboard. The W105 has an accelerometer for transforming the device into an e-reader of sorts, but oddly you can only rotate the screen in one direction -- you have to rotate it clockwise so that the bottom of the system sits in your left hand. The accelerometer is quick to start adjusting when turned, but it takes about seven seconds to adjust the software.</blockquote></p>
<p>It looks like the dual 7-inch 1024x600 LCDs could use a bit of IPS injection.</p>
