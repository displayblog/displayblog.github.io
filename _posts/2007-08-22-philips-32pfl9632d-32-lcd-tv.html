<em>Opinion</em><br />
The Philips 32PFL9632D looks simple and elegant. The piano-black border is surrounded by yet another border with small holes, probably for audio to come out from. There are four speakers, two more than usual. The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=100hz">100Hz</a>, which is double the frequency of European standards, will definitely aid in greatly reducing motion blur. I have changed the format of my postings to show quick stats at the top and my personal opinion on the bottom and a picture in the middle, if available. Hopefully this format will allow for faster and easier reading. Thanks to my brother, Don! Overall, I like the design and the LCD technology should provide good performance. The downside is the slightly high price of almost $2000. It is a downside considering brands such as <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=vizio">Vizio</a> is offering 42" <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a>s for half as much.</p>
