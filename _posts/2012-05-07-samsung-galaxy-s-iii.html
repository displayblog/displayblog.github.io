<blockquote><p>The 8.6 mm thick slate features a 4.8" HD SAMOLED display pushing 1280x720 pixels, on an RGBG stripe.</blockquote></p>
<p>RGB would have been better.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.05.08:</em> <a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2012/05/04/the-samsung-galaxy-s-iii-the-first-smartphone-designed-entirely-by-lawyers/">The First Smartphone Designed Entirely By Lawyers</a>.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.05.10:</em> Maybe RGB might <em>not</em> have been better. <a href="http://www.mobileburn.com/19548/news/samsung-pentile-amoled-displays-last-longer-thats-why-we-use-them">Dan Seifert, MobileBurn</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Samsung's Philip Berne explained to me that the blue subpixels on AMOLED displays actually degrade the fastest - quicker than the red or green subpixels. With a PenTile layout, the subpixels are arranged RGBG (red, green, blue, green), so they feature more green subpixels and fewer red or blue subpixels than an RGB stripe layout with the same resolution. Because of this, AMOLED displays that have the PenTile layout tend to have a longer lifespan than those with RGB layouts. Since Samsung is selling its phones to users that usually keep them for 18 months or longer, it has to be sure that the display will still offer peak performance at that time. According to the company, PenTile AMOLED displays have proven to be more reliable than those with RGB layouts.</blockquote></p>
<p>The reason is not because there are more green sub-pixels than red or blue. Someone from Nouvoyance should explain to Berne exactly why the blue OLED phosphor lasts longer in a PenTile Matrix sub-pixel structure compared to RGB. The real reason why PenTile lasts longer is because the blue sub-pixel is much larger and therefore does not need to be driven as hard compared to the blue pixel in a RGB sub-pixel layout.</p>
<p>But this is the interesting part: If I'm reading the above quote correctly, Samsung is not sure its RGB OLED display, called Super AMOLED Plus, will offer peak performance for 18 months or longer. That's it? <em>Eighteen</em> months? That must suck for Samsung Galaxy S II owners.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.05.22:</em></p>
<p>Samsung's Dong-hoon Jang took issue with blasphemy floating around accusing the world's largest mobile phone company of redesigning the Samsung Galaxy S III to make it look as little as possible as the iPhone due to ongoing litigation. <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/12/05/22/samsung_says_lawyers_didnt_design_new_galaxy_s_iii_smartphone.html">Sam Oliver, AppleInsider</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The curved shape of the new Galaxy S III is a design that has gone through hundreds of iterations, he said, adding that Samsung is a market leader in design.</blockquote></p>
<p>The new Galaxy S III design is the result of a five year plan according to Jang. Let's see... Five years ago would make it May of 2007. That actually makes a lot of sense: Samsung drew out a five-year design plan for its smartphones four months <em>after</em> Apple unveiled the original iPhone. A market leader in design? Why yes, of course.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.05.26:</em> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/25/3042640/samsung-galaxy-s-iii-review">Vlad Savov, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This 4.8-inch display can be held up proudly alongside most other AMOLED panels. Sadly, while that may have been a great compliment a year or two ago, the quality and viewing angles of AMOLED have recently been bypassed by refinements in LCD technology. HTC&acirc;&euro;&trade;s One X is the standout demonstration of that &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; offering unrivalled clarity, color balance, and viewing angles. In all of those respects, the Galaxy S III is one or two tiers below the One X [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>LCD > OLED.</p>
