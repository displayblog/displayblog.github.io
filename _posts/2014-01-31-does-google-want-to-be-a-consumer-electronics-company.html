<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2014/01/lemonade_space_station">John Gruber, Daring Fireball</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I wouldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t argue that Google wants to &acirc;&euro;&oelig;be like Apple&acirc;&euro;¬ù, but the idea that Google doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have its sights set on producing its own mass market consumer electronics would be a lot more compelling if they hadn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t just bought Nest for $3 billion, and hadn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t spent the last year hyping Google Glass.</blockquote></p>
<p>Google has not done very well building beautiful, functional consumer electronics products that are worth the price. The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2013/02/07/google-chromebook-pixel/">Chromebook Pixel</a> and the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2012/06/27/nexus-q/">Nexus Q</a> are two examples of beautiful but overpriced, and Glass is an example of overpriced. Google is betting Nest, not Motorola, will help in this regard.</p>
