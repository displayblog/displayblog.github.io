<p>Dell's 2707WFP is a 27" wide LCD monitor with a pixel format of 1920 x 1200. Dell's 24" has the same pixel format and I wonder what an extra 3 inches will do, especially considering the price of $1399, a considerable premium over its smaller 24" sibling (around $699). The contrast ratio is 1000:1, response time is 6ms and has a wide color gamut CCFL (WCG-CCFL) that improves the color gamut beyond the typical 72% to 92%.</p>

<p>The casing is in aluminum and has a height-adjustable stand with tilt and swivel. There are four USB 2.0 inputs, DVI, VGA, component, composite and S-Video. In addition, there is a 9-in-2 media card reader. Personally, it's just too expensive for what it is and there is no HDMI port. In my opinion, a HDMI port is an absolute necessity for multimedia monitors of the future. The future PC will not only be a PC it will behave much like the A/V receivers today pumping out music, videos as well as other content onto any display device... that has a HDMI port.</p>
