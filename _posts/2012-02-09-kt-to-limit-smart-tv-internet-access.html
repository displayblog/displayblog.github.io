<p><a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20120209001386">Ji-yoon Lee, The Korea Herald</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>KT Corp., the nation&acirc;&euro;&trade;s largest fixed-line operator, said Thursday that it would limit the Internet access of smart TVs from Friday, urging TV makers like Samsung and LG to pay the costs for network use.</blockquote></p>
<p>Samsung, obviously, doesn't like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>KT&acirc;&euro;&trade;s decision goes against the principle of network neutrality, under which consumers can use services without discrimination. Moreover, we need to verify whether smart TVs actually cause excessive data traffic.</blockquote></p>
<p>This is odd. Internet connectivity is fast and affordable in South Korea. For instance, my parents in Seoul pay roughly US$20 per month for a 100mbps pipe. I doubt smart TVs will put much of a dent into that kind of bandwidth.</p>
