<p><a href="http://global.samsungtomorrow.com/?p=32254">Samsung Tomorrow</a>: Samsung announced a ton of new products, but the most impressive is the curved display technology. Samsung unveiled a 21:9 105-inch curved 4K Ultra HD with a 5120x2160 pixel format, much like the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2013/12/18/lg-105ub9/">LG 105UB9</a>. One unique design element is the single curved piece of wood that's used for the back panel of the massive TV. Other curved 4K TVs are in the works: 55, 65, and 78 inches. In terms of nomenclature I'm guessing all TVs with more than 2160 vertical pixels with an aspect ratio of 16:9 or wider will be called &acirc;&euro;&oelig;4K Ultra HD&acirc;&euro;¬ù.</p>
<p>In related news, Samsung announced M-GO, a Technicolor and DreamWorks Animation joint venture, will stream both natively 4K and streamed 4K movies to its latest 4K Ultra HD TVs. M-GO already has agreements with LG, Roku, and Vizio, but so does Samsung: 4K content from Amazon, Comcast, DirecTV, and Netflix will be streamed to 4K Ultra HD TVs from Samsung.</p>
<p>Next up are tablets: <a href="http://global.samsungtomorrow.com/?p=32205">Samsung announced Galaxy TabPRO and NotePRO tablets</a>. The Galaxy TabPRO will come in three sizes: 8.4, 10.1, and 12.2 inches. The Galaxy NotePRO will come in only one size: 12.2 inches. All four tablets sport a 16:10 2560x1600 LCD. The focus on these PRO tablets are productivity and multitasking with the goal of replacing traditional notebooks. Of course the NotePRO comes with the Samsung S Pen, which is popular among those who prefer the experience of writing and doodling the old-fashioned compared to typing.</p>
<p>Getting a little bigger, Samsung updated its ATIV line of notebooks with the ATIV Book 9 2014 Edition, which sports a 20% brighter 15.6-inch 1920x1080 LCD. Even with a brighter display the ATIV Book 9 2014 Edition has a claimed battery life of 14 hours. In other ATIV news, <a href="http://global.samsungtomorrow.com/?p=32209">Samsung unveiled its ATIV One 7 2014 Edition</a> all-in-one sporting a 10-point touch-enabled 16:9 24-inch 1920x1080 display with 178-degree viewing angles and an anti-reflection layer. Not at all revolutionary, but at least both display brightness and battery life as well as multitouch are all incrementally getting better at the same time.</p>
