  displays due to intense price pressures from TFT LCDs at the smaller sizes. Since

<p>LCD technology is the 600 pound gorilla in the world of displays. LCDs range from the tiny to the very large and are incorporated into the latest <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=smartphone">smartphone</a>s as well as the biggest <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a>s and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=digital-signage">digital signage</a> displays. Any company with a different technology will need to find ways to not only compete but to survive. Such is the case with <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=chi-mei-el">Chi Mei EL</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=cmel">CMEL</a>). CMEL manufactures <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=oled">OLED</a> displays. The company will be shifting to larger <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=active-matrix-oled">active matrix OLED</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=amoled">AMOLED</a>) displays due to intense price pressures from TFT LCDs at the smaller sizes. Since AMOLEDs are more difficult and expensive to manufacture than TFT LCDs, it is almost impossible to compete. So CMEL is moving toward larger sizes from its current <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=7.6"">7.6"</a> AMOLED to 10" and beyond. <a id="more"></a><a id="more-2636"></a></p>
<p>The only problem with this strategic move is that TFT LCD also has those sizes covered. With the advent of the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=netbook">netbook</a>, it seems there will be plenty demand and therefore supply of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=10"">10"</a> TFT LCDs and for a very competitive price. Will AMOLED be able to compete at that size segment? Maybe. I can see an opportunity for a high-end netbook as the current crop of 10" netbooks seem to be in need of an infusion of quality.</p>
<p>CMEL is also gunning for AMOLED TV panels by 2010 or 2011. I'm forced to repeat myself again: LCD technology has pretty much captured that market too, whatever the size, and especially so by 2011. I do hope AMOLED displays become easier and cheaper to manufacturer, but it doesn't look like it will happen any time soon. Good luck CMEL, you'll need it.</p>
