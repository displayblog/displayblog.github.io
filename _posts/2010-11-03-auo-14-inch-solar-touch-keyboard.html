<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20101103PR201.html">Digitimes</a>: A 14-inch solar-powered touch keyboard. The solar module is just 2.1mm thick. And power consumption is reduced by 20%. I have one concern: I'm not sure you can see the keyboard out in the sun, where you would benefit the most. AUO intends to showcase it at the FPD International 2010 show in Chiba, Japan.</p>
