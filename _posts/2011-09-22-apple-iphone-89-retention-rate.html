<p><a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/09/22/apples_iphone_has_89_retention_rate_next_nearest_hardware_is_htc_at_39.html">Neil Hughes at AppleInsider</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A whopping 89 percent of iPhone owners have indicated they will stick with Apple for their next handset, dwarfing all other hardware makers, according to a new survey.</blockquote></p>
<p>The survey was conducted by UBS Investment Research. I'm part of that 89%, but with a twist. When I complete my two year sentence with AT&T I will stick with the iPhone but move to a different carrier. Most likely Sprint. Hopefully the unlimited data plan will survive until around this time next year. #2 HTC had a 39% retention rate.</p>
