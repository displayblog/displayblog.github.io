<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/29/3569540/google-nexus-4-preview-price-release-date">The Verge</a>: Based on the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2012/08/25/lg-optimus-g/">LG Optimus G</a> the Google Nexus 4 sports a 4.7-inch 1280x768 IPS+ LCD. The touch sensor is optically laminated to the Gorilla Glass 2 cover glass, which LG calls G2 technology, that reduces air gaps and brings the pixels closer to your eyes. Of course a more advanced technology is to integrate the touch sensors directly into the LCD called <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2012/10/16/iphone-5-in-cell-touch/">in-cell touch, which is found in the iPhone 5</a>. The next step toward eliminating obstructions between pixels and our eyes will be to harden the top polarizer and eliminate the cover glass. I dislike the thick, heavy, and costly cover glass solution. The only time a cover glassed gadget looks nice is when it's off. </p>
<p>Google claims the Qualcomm 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro CPU that's powering the Nexus 4 is the fastest on the market today. Other specs include: 2GB RAM, 8MP camera (back) / 1.3MP camera (front), Bluetooth, NFC, WiFi BGN. The 8GB Nexus 4 will be priced at US$299 while the 16GB is $349 and available November 13. (Note: These are unlocked, off-contract, full retail prices.) One obvious feature is lacking though: LTE. Why? <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/29/3569688/why-nexus-4-does-not-have-4g-lte/in/3335719">It's complicated</a>; read at your own risk.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.10.30:</em> Andrew Cunningham, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/10/need-for-speed-just-how-fast-is-googles-new-nexus-4/">Ars Technica</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you can get past the lack of LTE, the Nexus 4 (and by extension the Optimus G, which will give you LTE but take away the Nexus line's guaranteed updates) is easily the fastest Android handset you can buy today.</blockquote></p>
<p>Most apps depend on an Internet connection and the faster that connection the better the experience. Without LTE is the Nexus 4 really the fastest?</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.11.02:</em> <em>via</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/11/02/panzarino-nexus-4">John Gruber</a>. Matthew Panzarino, <a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2012/10/29/googles-lame-duck-explanation-of-why-the-nexus-4-doesnt-have-lte/">The Next Web</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The iPhone 5 offers zero concessions to carriers in the form of interface customizations or pre-installed software, something that Google has done its best to avoid on the Nexus line (and bravo to them for that). And yet, the iPhone 5 is available in LTE around the world. Apple had to fit the latest low-power chips in the device and ship three different models to do it, but they did it and with a minimum of customer confusion. People don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t know how much effort it took for Apple to make LTE work everywhere, they just know that they can buy one locally and use it on an LTE network. It is completely possible to make this happen, Google just didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t put forth the effort.</blockquote></p>
<p>I'm afraid there seems to be a lot of truth to what Panzarino is saying here. If Apple did it with the iPhone 5, why didn't Google with the Nexus 4? Maybe Google <em>couldn't</em> for some reason. Let's get back to displays. Joshua Topolsky, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/11/2/3589280/google-nexus-4-review">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Speaking of improvements, the display on this phone is big upgrade over the Galaxy Nexus' Super AMOLED screen, which was often far too dim when set to auto-brightness, seemed very over-saturated, and did a somewhat poor job of cleanly reproducing text. The 4.7-inch, 1280 x 768 LCD display of the Nexus 4 has no such trouble, producing images that are clean and crisp in just about any light setting.</blockquote></p>
<p>Topolsky mentioned one niggle: colors are a bit washed out. Accurate colors can look washed out if we're used to blown out colors. We'll have to wait and see for test results to know for sure.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.11.18:</em> According to <a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Nexus+4+Teardown/11781/3">iFixit</a> the 4.7-inch 1280x768 IPS LCD is manufactured by LG Display with model number LH467WX1. The touch controller is Synaptics S7020A.</p>
