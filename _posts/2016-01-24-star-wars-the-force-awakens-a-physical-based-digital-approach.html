<p>[ <a href="http://www.studiodaily.com/2016/01/ilm-vfx-supervisor-roger-guyett-on-star-wars-the-force-awakens/">Studio Daily</a> ] ILM VFX Supervisor Roger Guyett in an interview with Barbara Robertson:</p>
<blockquote><p>When you see the little speeder moving across the landscape, it&rsquo;s a completely digital shot. But because we&rsquo;d been there, when we recreated that moment, we did it from a physically-based approach. I don&rsquo;t know if J.J. [Abrams] knows how we constructed the images, but he was at the location and he knew how it looked.</blockquote></p>
<p>My son and I went to see Star Wars: The Force Awakens in IMAX 3D. Both of us enjoyed the movie. The 3D wasn't overdone, but I'd like to watch it again at an IMAX theater without 3D. I'll probably head on over to The Tech Museum of Innovation in downtown San Jose in the very near future.</p>
<p>I did see the little speeder, a hovercraft, moving across the landscape. The speeder with Rey played by Daisy Ridley at the wheel was zipping through the desert far away; it looked analog, like film, but modern high-resolution film. The overall feel of Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a nice mixture of Star Wars IV, V, and V in terms of the visual experience.</p>
