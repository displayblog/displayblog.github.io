<blockquote><p>The duralumin material that wrapped the previous Series 9 has been replaced with a dark aluminum, and Samsung's using the new all-popular thin bezel trick, allowing it to fit a 15-inch display in a 14-inch chassis and a 13.3-inch display in more of a 12-inch case. Even better, the screens have also been enhanced: both versions have 1600 x 900-resolution, 400nit, matte displays.</blockquote></p>
<p>Wouldn't you want to add a few more pixels on the larger one? 1920x1080 would have been nice. I applaud the choice of matte and the elimination of a cover glass, which only adds thickness, weight, and an air gap where dust gets trapped.</p>
<p>The thin bezel trick is a cool trick indeed, but the asymmetric bezel thickness is an eye sore. And that gigantic bottom one. Ewww.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.03.30</em> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/3/29/2911827/samsung-series-9-review-15-inch-2012">Sean Hollister, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Samsung's 15-inch display is actually a good bit above average, a nice matte sunlight-viewable panel with a fairly reasonable 1600 x 900 resolution and 400 nits of brightness (that's fairly bright), but vertical viewing angles aren't great, and the laptop's flimsy hinge means they're easy to knock out of alignment. Colors are a bit washed out, and while the gamut isn't nearly as narrow as on the Envy 15, reds do look a good bit closer to orange and violets to blue than I'd hope for. If you're considering the spectrum of Windows laptops as a whole, it's really not bad, but a $1,500 premium machine should have a premium screen to go with it.</blockquote></p>
<p>A 1600x900 15-inch display with washed-out colors, a narrow color gamut, and limited viewing angles in a $US1500 notebook is not reasonable.</p>
