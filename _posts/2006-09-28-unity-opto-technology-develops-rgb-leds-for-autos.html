<p>Taiwan-based Unity Opto Technology, a LED manufacturer, developed RGB LEDs that can be used to illuminate from the side of a LCD or from the back. Unity also began shipments of its backlights for 7&acirc;&euro;&sup3; automotive displays and 12&acirc;&euro;&sup3; notebook PC displays. The company is also stating that it has entered the car dash lighting market. For the first eight months of this year ending August, Unity has generated NT$1.48 billion or US$45 million in sales, which is a 4.4% Y-over-Y increase from 2005.</p>
