<p>General Displays &amp; Technologies (GDT) is the result of a joint venture between <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=general-electric">General Electric</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=ge">GE</a>) and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=tatung">Tatung</a> Company. GE will hold a 49% stake in GDT.</p>
<p>What will GDT do? Manufacture GE-branded HDTVs including IPTVs. So, the proposal is to take advantage of the huge mindshare that GE has for kitchenware and lightbulbs and bring that into the living room in the form of a GE HDTV. And you won't need to wait to make that decision since the first GE-branded HDTVs will be headed our way in the spring of 2009.</p>
<p>Digital content directly through the HDTV will be one of GDT's goals. GDT will work with NBC Universal to develop an open platform that connects the HDTV directly to the Internet and download digital content. GDT is aiming to manufacture 2 million HDTVs in 2009.</p>
