<p><a href="http://www.j-display.com/english/news/2012/20120604.html">Japan Display Inc.</a>: This is older news, but JDI's 1280x800 2.3-inch LCD sports an unheard of resolution of 651 ppi and a microscopic pixel pitch of just 39&Icirc;&frac14;m. JDI states 16.7 million colors are supported, but I am uncertain if that's true 8 bit or 6 bit +FRC. There is a closeup comparison of the 651-ppi to a 326-ppi (that should sound familiar as it is the same as what's found in the iPhone 4/4S retina display) and it is quite clear we <em>need</em> higher ppi.</p>
