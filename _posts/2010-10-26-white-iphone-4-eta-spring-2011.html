<p>John Paczkowski at <a href="http://digitaldaily.allthingsd.com/20101026/apple-no-white-iphones-til-spring/?mod=tweet">All Things D</a> got this from Apple:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&acirc;&euro;&trade;re sorry to disappoint customers waiting for the white iPhone yet again, but we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve decided to delay its release until this Spring.</blockquote></p>
<p>We all know Steve Jobs is a perfectionist, so we're not going to get the white iPhone 4 until the white is perfect. 2011 is just two months away.</p>
