<p>On September 14, 2006, Texas Instruments (TI) featured a prototype SIM2 HT-5000 3-chip 1080p projector at CEDIA Expo 2006. Digital Projection (TITAN 1080p-250) and Runco (Video Xtreme Series) were also demonstrating 3-chip 1080p DLP projectors. DLP set makers are incorporating BrilliantColor technology that uses 6-color processing for better color saturation and a 50% increase in brightness in mid-tone images. There will be ten DLP makers that will announce 1080p products: Digital Projection, InFocus, Marantz, Optoma, Panasonic, Planar, projectiondesign, Runco, Sharp, SIM2.</p>
