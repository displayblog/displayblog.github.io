<p>The AL2616W is part of the trio of LCD monitors that Acer recently announced. The other two are the <a href="http://displayblog.wordpress.com/2006/07/30/acer-al2216w-22-wide-lcd-monitor/">AL2216W (22")</a> and the AL2423W (24"). The AL2616W is one of the very first 26" LCD monitors to hit the market. Of course, there have been many 26" LCD TVs, but those displays have a limited resolution of only 1366 x 768. The AL2616W has a contrast ratio of 1000:1, 500 cd/m2 of brightness, VGA and DVI inputs.</p>
<p>Similar to the <a href="http://displayblog.wordpress.com/2006/07/30/acer-al2216w-22-wide-lcd-monitor/">AL2216W</a>, the 26" will undergo a slight spec bump in the fourth quarter adding HDCP. Although I wasn't too thrilled with DVI-HDCP on the <a href="http://displayblog.wordpress.com/2006/07/30/acer-al2216w-22-wide-lcd-monitor/">22"</a>, the 26" AL2616W will make good use of it. With Blu-Ray and HD-DVD content mostly requiring a DVI-HDCP setup, the 1920 x 1200 resolution will have enough resolution for 1080p. You will see 60 black lines top and bottom, but it will be very small to the 1080 lines of Full HD content you will be focusing on. Viewing angles are 178 degrees with response times of 6ms. The picture of the unit should be very similar to the <a href="http://displayblog.wordpress.com/2006/07/30/acer-al2216w-22-wide-lcd-monitor/">AL2216W</a>.</p>
