<p>I haven't posted anything for a while because I have been having problems with OS X 10.10 Yosemite on my 2009 MacBook Pro. I should have waited before upgrading to Yosemite. Online forums are filled with frustrated users who upgraded to Yosemite on their older Macs.</p>
<p>My MacBook Pro is sufficiently equipped to run Yosemite: 2.8GHz Core 2 Duo CPU, 8GB RAM, 50GB SSD & 1TB HDD. I haven't been able to figure out what exactly is the cause, but when I have any programs running, say Safari, after some time &mdash; it could be minutes or hours, you never know &mdash; the thing would freeze. If it was sleeping it doesn't come out of sleep. If it was not sleeping it doesn't respond to any input. The only thing it responds to is a long press of the power button, a hard power down.</p>
<p>After powering down and powering up dozens of times a day I had had enough. All those Apple ads about snazzy looking Macs with happy people, and here I was, not so happy. Sure my MacBook Pro still looks pretty good, but what good is good looks when it keeps on freezing and you can't do anything with it. I was getting frustrated. I was even angry at Tim Cook: Instead of keeping his eye on the ball &mdash; not that he is directly in charge of OS development &mdash; he's been all over the news getting interviewed here and there talking up how hard Apple works to make hardware and software work seamlessly together blah blah blah. I wasn't too happy with Jony Ive either, for the same reasons. I've been in a bad mood for several days.</p>
<p>So today I decided I'm going to either find a way to downgrade to Mavericks or get a new computer. And if I was forced to get a new computer it wasn't going to be a Mac. After a few attempts, my Mac was not letting me downgrade, at least not on my primary boot drive. I'll save you the geeky nitty gritty details. There was my 1TB storage drive though. After going through some long and detailed instructions, I managed to prep a 8GB USB drive into a OS X 10.9.5 Mavericks Install Disk. Now the 1TB hard drive is where the SuperDrive used to be, and it's not the fastest connection. But I was so fed up with Yosemite, I decided I would much rather have slow-as-molasses and reliable than fast and totally unreliable. It took me the entire afternoon to backup all of my files from the 1TB internal hard drive to an external one; once all of my files were safely backed up I was ready to try to install OS X Mavericks unto my non-boot 1TB drive. I wasn't sure it was going to work, but it did! Yes it is slow &mdash; really stinkin' slow &mdash; but I am happy I can be doing stuff again on my MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>I don't know how long it will take Apple to sort this Yosemite mess, but I will not be booting into it until there is widespread confirmation from 2009 Mac users that Yosemite's freezing problems have been fixed. I've learned my lesson: Apple no longer seems to wait to get everything right before launching. And I better not see Tim Cook or Jony Ive getting another interview before Yosemite is fixed.</p>
