<p>On May 9, 2008, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=%22e+ink%22">E Ink</a> announced its next generation <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=electronic-paper-display">electronic paper display</a> technology called segmented display cells (SDC). The SDC products are simple digit, icon and alpha-numeric displays that feature a paper-thin form factor that consumes very little power and can be easily read. The SDC displays use the same E Ink Vizplex technology found in the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?p=882">Amazon Kindle</a>, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?p=850">Sony's Reader</a> and the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?p=1147">iRex iLiad</a>. The cool thing about E Ink's SDC-based displays is that it can be cut into any shape including rectangles. Delphi has chosen E Ink's SDC for its wireless, bi-directional key fob for car-to-user and user-to-car communication and as can be seen in the picture the SDC display has a non-rectangular shape. Could we be seeing E Ink's SDC technology used for displaying HVAC information <em>inside</em> the car?</p>
<p>There are three height levels: thin PET 330 microns, PET 380 microns, or PI 375 microns. PET options provide 200 micron design rules for the art work or space and trace of 8 mils by 8 mils. The finer pitch PI option uses 100 micron design rules for 4 mils by 4 mils. The SDC can be used in temperature ranges with operations from -10&Acirc;&deg;C to 60&Acirc;&deg;C, and storage from -25&Acirc;&deg;C to 75&Acirc;&deg;C. E Ink's SDC feature viewing angles of nearly 180&Acirc;&deg; and can be viewed under direct sun light to low-level ambient light. An image can remain on the display for over a year while consuming zero power.</p>
<p>E Ink's SDC "Design to Mass Production" program allows production-ready samples from customer-supplied CAD files within eight weeks and enter mass production within twelve weeks. E Ink has partnered with several chip suppliers, including Dialog Semiconductor, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=epson">Epson</a> Semiconductor, Solomon-Systech, and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=citizen">Citizen</a>. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=e-ink">E Ink</a> has six standard SDC designs for fast prototyping and application specific solutions: stacked 10-bar, graduated 5-bar, 100%, MB/GB, 8-digit and 6-digit SDCs. </p>
