<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/6/8560195/microsoft-continuum-for-phones-windows-10">Tom Warren, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The phone interface scales up to a large display or TV, and the Start Menu takes the same Tiles found on the phone to provide access to apps. While it looks like the Windows 10 desktop, there are some subtle differences, and traditional desktop apps won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t run here. In a way, it feels like the natural successor to Windows RT, but one that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s actually useful if developers create the universal apps required to really take advantage of it.</blockquote></p>
<p>Microsoft Continuum lets you use a Windows smartphone on a big display running Windows. And unlike Android apps, where they look and behave the same on a 4-inch smartphone as it does on a 6-inch smartphone, Continuum is aware of the larger display and takes advantage of the additional pixels.</p>
<p>I mentioned in a previous post that most Android apps stink, but that I did buy one: Pocket Casts. If I could run an app like that &mdash; simple, intuitive, with a fantastic user experience &mdash; on my Windows machine, that would be great. Another app that is like nothing else is Reeder, a RSS reader, on iOS. There's a Mac version of Reeder, but I prefer the iOS version for its simplicity. If I could run Reeder on my Windows machine, that would be great too. (At the moment I use Feedly as my RSS reader on my smartphone and laptops, but it is merely good enough; I want something that makes me smile.)</p>
<p>Now I see why I might want a touch-enabled display on my laptop or monitor: to control smartphone apps. I expect developers will be porting their apps to Windows since it's now supposed to be really easy. Right?</p>
