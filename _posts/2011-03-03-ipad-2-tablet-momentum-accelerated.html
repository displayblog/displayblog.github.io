<p>Goldman Sachs analyst Bill Shope <em>via</em> <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2011/03/03/goldman-on-apple-here-are-the-coming-catalysts-for-shares/?mod=yahoo_hs">The Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We believe the iPad 2 introduction and the June iPhone refresh will serve as critical catalysts in the coming months. Our model had conservatively assumed that the company would lower wholesale ASPs, so we are adjusting our estimates to reflect the unchanged price points. We are maintaining our unit estimates due to our view that the iPad 2 will accelerate Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s competitive momentum in tablets.</blockquote></p>
<p>In other words, Apple didn't lower the price, but the iPad 2 will continue to dominate the tablet market. No one has a cheaper tablet; actually no one has a tablet that matches the price. But if rock-bottom pricing is your thing, check out the still excellent original iPad, now starting at just $399 for the 16GB WiFi version.</p>
