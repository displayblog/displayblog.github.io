<blockquote><p>Its camera is terrible, it cannot play back Full HD video, and there&acirc;&euro;&trade;s no LTE option. The LCD display also exhibits a subtle rainbow-like color cast when displaying pure white backgrounds. Those are all limitations I can tolerate, however.</blockquote></p>
<p>The US$129 Moto E sports a 4.3-inch 960x540 display. I can tolerate the lack of LTE, but I can't tolerate a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;rainbow-like color cast&acirc;&euro;¬ù or a terrible camera. $129 is cheap, but it's still $129 of my money. Just to compare you can pick up a used iPhone 4s, which has an awesome display, and takes pretty good photos, for about $130 on Craigslist.</p>
