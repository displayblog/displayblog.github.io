<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/10/05/asus-joins-the-22-inch-madness-with-the-mw221u/">Engadget</a>: Asus seems to have come out with a winner. The MW221U is a 22" wide LCD monitor with a 1680 x 1050 pixel format at 16:10 aspect ratio. Other features include a super fast 2ms response time, a very decent 700:1 contrast ratio, and a decent brightness of 300 cd/m2. If you want to use the MW221U as a TV and watch some HD content, you can do that via the HDCP-enabled DVI port.</p>
<p>I'm not a big fan of the 1680 x 1050 pixel format, especially if you're into watching HD content. It's not 1280 x 720 nor is it 1920 x 1080. So both HD formats will need to be scaled and that almost always decreases picture quality. If you're not into HD viewing then this isn't such a big concern. </p>
<p>But if you're into games, the super fast response time of 2ms will certainly give you an edge over your competition. The contrast ratio of 700:1 is very decent and should yield some good details so you can more easily zoom into where your opponent's head is sticking out behind some dark bushes.</p>
<p>In terms of price, the MW221U is not the cheapest, but the super fast response time with the ability to multitask as a TV for HD content should prompt you to give some serious thought about the value.</p>
