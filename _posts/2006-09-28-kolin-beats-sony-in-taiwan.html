<p>Big news everyone! Kolin shipped more LCD TVs in August than Sony. Kolin&acirc;&euro;&trade;s number is at 4,000 LCD TVs in August that includes the</p>
<p>#1 Kolin, 4,000+<br />
#2 Chimei<br />
#3 Panasonic<br />
#4 Sony</p>
<p>The surprising thing is that Sony took the #1 spot at all. Sony being a premium brand with premium prices, you wouldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t expect it to outsell dirt-cheap LCD TVs from Kolin, Tatung, Sampo, Teco, etc. but it did. Sony&acirc;&euro;&trade;s premium brand continues but at less premium prices. Sony has become the new value leader and will continue to offer aggressive prices for top-of-the-line design and technology. That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s hard to beat.</p>
