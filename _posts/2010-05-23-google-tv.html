I'm sitting in our old room. My brother and I shared this room when we were young. Next to me is a myLGtv box. The Internet connection in this house has a bandwidth of 100mbps, which is quite common in Korea. For that fat of a pipe in the US it would cost a serious amount, probably more than $100 per month, if it is available at all. In Korea, thanks to intense competition, the monthly bill is just around $20.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p><br />
The little black myLGtv box has a lot of interesting services. One of them is called myPC and it accesses shared videos, images and music off of a PC. You can also insert a USB stick on the back of the myLGtv box to do the same thing. You can play games such as Go, sing songs (karaoke), learn English, purchase movies via VOD, etc. Terrestrial channels, including a lot of HD versions, total about 100. The only feature lacking is Internet-based video integration; US-based examples would be YouTube and Hulu. Oh, there is one more feature missing: DVR. So here in Korea there is already something similar to Google TV with the exception of Internet-based video integration. But an Internet-integrated TV-watching experience is what Google TV is all about, right?</p>
<p>I might be naive in thinking this, but don't we already have a perfect device that does a lot of these things already? By using a full-blown computer with a TV tuner attached to it we can watch pretty much anything we want: Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, all the channels the TV tuner brings in, DVD, Blu-ray, etc. With a proper NAS there is access to not only the movie archives but also the hundreds of thousands of photographs as well as terabytes of music. Even the enormous hard drives inside the computer will make it simple to store hundreds of shows via DVR. Why are we in such a hurry to find other solutions when we already have one?&Acirc;&nbsp;Engadget got all the folks together for their <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/05/21/engadget-on-google-tv/">opinions on Google TV</a> and is worth a read.</p>
