<p><a href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/consumer/purchase-intent-for-3dtv-varies-around-the-globe/">Nielsen</a> &rarr; <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5715891/survey-says-we-all-hate-3dtv">Gizmodo</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>SPOILER ALERT: less than 10 percent of those asked said they'll buy a 3D television in the next year.</p>
<p>Another 15 percent polled said they might buy a 3DTV, but that's not so promising when over 60 percent said they they definitely won't buy a 3DTV. And when only narrowed down to North America, just 3 percent of North Americans say they plan to buy a 3D set in the next year.</blockquote></p>
<p>I'm no fan of 3D myself, especially since it isn't good for kids. Read <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/09/24/dvorak-3d-bad-for-your-eyes/">Dvorak: 3D Bad For Your Eyes</a>.</p>
