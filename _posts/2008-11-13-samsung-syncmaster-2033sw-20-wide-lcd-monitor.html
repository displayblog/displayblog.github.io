<p>AV Watch (<a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;u=http://av.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/20081113/samsung.htm">translated from Japanese</a>): Samsung's SyncMaster 2033SW is an interesting LCD monitor. The size is 20" and has a 16:9 aspect ratio. Traditionally that would meant that it had a 1366x768 pixel format. Well, the 2033SW throws that tradition out the window and instead has a pixel format of 1600 x 900. Nice and simple. For watching 16:9 HD content. But what about work? If more pixels mean more productivity, the 2033SW delivers. A 1366x768 pixel format yields 1.049 million pixels while the 1600x900 format gives you 1.44 million pixels. Who is Samsung targeting?</p>
<p>I thought Samsung was laser focusing this interesting 16:9 20" LCD monitor to the crowd that would like to watch HDTV on it. But maybe not. If you have a look at the connectivity options there are DVI-D with HDCP and VGA. No HDMI, which is, IMO, the de facto digital standard when it comes to connecting external video sources like Tivo, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Blu-ray players, Apple TV, etc. Maybe Samsung is thinking that users will get all of their 16:9 HD content from a PC instead. Regardless, Samsung is entering unchartered territory with an unique 16:9 20" LCD monitor in the 2033SW. Kudos to them for thinking outside of the box.</p>
