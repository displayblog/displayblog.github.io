<p>The feature that makes this 22" LCD monitor different from others is the built-in multi-format media card reader that takes in USB flash drives, SD, MMC, MS and xD memory cards. No luck with CF. Big is out, except for when it comes to display size.</p>

<p>The 2230Fm has a lot of input connections too as you can see from the picture above: HDMI, DVI, and VGA. But it falls short on being a HDTV since it doesn't have a tuner built-in. What AOC is trying to convince us is that all we have to do is put all of our video stuff unto memory cards and view them that way: PC-less and DVD player-less.</p>

<p>The 22" is most likely the TN LCD variety. You can tell by the fast response time of just 2ms. The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dynamic-contrast">dynamic contrast</a> ratio of 20,000:1 is a great fit for what AOC intends the 2230Fm to be: a multimedia display. Moving pictures should look pretty good, though not as good as real LCD TVs with such technologies as <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=120hz">120Hz</a> and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led-backlight">LED backlight</a>s.</p>
<p>Here is the full press release regarding the 2230fm:</p>
<blockquote><p>AOC Introduces HD3 Technology with the Launch of their 2230Fm Display; a New Breed of Multi-functional High-definition Display Technology</p>
