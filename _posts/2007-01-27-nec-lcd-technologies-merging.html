<p>NEC Corporation and NEC LCD Technologies has decided that they will merge NEC Akita and NEC Kagoshima with their parent company NEC LCD Technologies, effective April 1, 2007. The merging will increase operational efficiencies, streamline the decision making process, and allow NEC LCD Technologies to be more responsive to the market.</p>
<p>In addition to this, NEC LCD Technologies will need to flatten the organization somewhat so that employees that interact with customers can send feedback up the decision makers without it being buried within organizational bureaucracy. A reduction in headcount, something that Asians in general do not like to do, might be necessary to achieve a nimble organization.</p>
