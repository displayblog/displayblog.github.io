<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=samsung">Samsung</a>'s S2 <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=mp3">MP3</a> player is very well designed. Simple. Cute. And has a huge "I want it" factor. If only flexible <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=oled">OLED</a> displays were actually around, these S2 pebbles would be seriously cool.</p>

<p>The cute little MP3 players come in white, red, green, purple and black. I would like translucent versions of these please. You've got 1GB or 2GB options and these play back MP3, WMA and Ogg audio files.</p>
