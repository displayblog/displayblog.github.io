<p>On May 9, 2008, Sumitomo Chemical announced its plans to produce and sell 40" and larger organic electroluminescence display panels. I am assuming in this case that organic electroluminescence (organic EL) means the same thing as organic light emitting diode (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=oled">OLED</a>). JCNetwork's article point to EL panels being thinner than LCDs and consuming less power. I must disagree.</p>
<p>Everyone seems to think Sony's <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=xel-1">XEL-1</a> OLED TV is super thin and much thinner than a comparable LCD. Well, the upper part of the XEL-1 is in fact much thinner. The lower part? I'm not sure; it looks pretty think to me. and the base? Well, if you had to put that base on the back of the display, we're looking at a downright chunky 11" OLED TV. The part about consuming less power: yes, OLED displays consume less power when they are black. And that's why you see a lot of OLED-based mobile phones and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=pmp">PMP</a>s with UIs that are mostly black. Will a 40" OLED TV consume less power than a 40" <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a>? Depends on whether you're watching The Matrix or Ice Age.</p>
<p>Sumitomo Chemical is developing a "macromolecule-type" organic EL panel because these have a cost and scalability advantage in manufacturing due to ink-jet printing processes. Ink-jet based manufacturing of OLEDs have been in R&D for many years. I hope 2009 is the year for Sumitomo, but as is the case with all new technologies, including OLEDs, things generally take a bit longer to get things up and running smoothly.</p>
