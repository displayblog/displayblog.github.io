<blockquote><p>Aside from Siri's inabilities to interpret certain vague phrases or comprehend uncommon Japanese phrases, its loading time is far longer than the Syabette Concier. Not to mention how some reactions were very unnatural and rigid. It seems as though Siri is spread too thinly with so many languages to support at the same time.</blockquote></p>
