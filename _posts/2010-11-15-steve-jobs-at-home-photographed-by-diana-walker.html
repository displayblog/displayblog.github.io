<p>Diana Walker was the White House photographer for <em>Time</em> magazine for two decades. She has a new booked titled <a href="http://digitaljournalist.org/issue0712/walker.html"><em>The Bigger Picture</em></a>. Walker had the opportunity to take photos of Steve Jobs at his home in August 2004. Hop on over to <a href="http://allaboutstevejobs.com/pics/life/2004-2006/08-dianawalker/lightbox-iframe.html#0">allaboutSteveJobs.com</a> for 14 other photos. What did he use for his monitor back then? The 30-inch, of course.</p>
