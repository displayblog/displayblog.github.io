<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/1/27/2742785/lg-spectrum-review">David Pierce, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As with the Nitro, the display is the key feature of the Spectrum. For good reason, too: the 1280 x 720 IPS display is excellent; sharp and clear with extremely accurate colors. Samsung's Galaxy S phones in particular have a tendency to give everything a warm color temperature, with a slightly red and orange tint, but LG's displays are much more accurate. Viewing angles are also really good, with virtually no discoloration even when you're off axis. My only real complaint is that the LCD looks like it's set way below the protective layer of Gorilla Glass. Unlike the iPhone's screen, which is laminated to the glass to make it seem like it's right on the surface, the Spectrum's display looks like it's far away from your finger as you tap it.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Corning Gorilla Glass is <em>not</em> optically laminated to the 4.5-inch IPS LCD? Terrible. And the LG Spectrum drains the battery in "a few hours of use". That's terrible too.</p>
