<p><a href="http://www.e-ink-info.com/auos-sipix-e-paper-now-fast-enough-video-6fps">E-Ink-Info.com</a>: E Ink with video is what this looks like. AU Optronics' Sipix e-paper technology is good enough for video at 6 fps. By loading the images into buffer memory video performance can be improved to 10 fps according to IRX Innovation. The video pixel format is 640x480 with four levels of gray moving up to 16 in the near future.</p>
