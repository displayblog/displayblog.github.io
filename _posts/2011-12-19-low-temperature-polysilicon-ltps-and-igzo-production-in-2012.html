<p><a href="http://www.displaysearch.com/cps/rde/xchg/displaysearch/hs.xsl/111219_low_temperature_polysilicon_and_igzo_production_forecast_to_skyrocket_in_2012.asp">NPD DisplaySearch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The explosive growth of smart phones and tablets has made high performance TFT technologies, particularly LTPS (low temperature polysilicon) and IGZO (indium gallium zinc oxide), critical to production of the high resolution displays used by these devices. These TFT technologies employ high mobility semiconductor materials, which allow panel manufacturers to shrink TFT dimensions and increase light transmission. LCDs with greater than 230 ppi (pixels per inch) resolution, such as Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Retina Display, are enabled by high transmission because it minimizes power consumption, allowing mobile devices to run longer without recharging.</p>
<p>[...] high mobility backplane production is forecast to grow 150% from 5.6 million square meters in 2011 to 14.1 million square meters in 2012. Drivers for this tremendous growth include multiple Gen 5 and larger LTPS fabs starting production in 2012, as well as expected IGZO production on existing lines by Sharp, LG Display and Samsung.</blockquote></p>
