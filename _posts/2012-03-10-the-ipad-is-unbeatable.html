<blockquote><p>Because if they really believed that tablets will come to eclipse PCs, and if they saw how thoroughly unbeatable the iPad is becoming, wouldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t they be running around with their hair on fire? If the iPad becomes the future of computing, the fortunes of Microsoft, Intel, Dell, and to some extent Hewlett-Packard will begin to plummet. Meanwhile Google, which makes all its money through ads, will find itself reaching its customers through a device made by a hostile rival.</blockquote></p>
<p>The iPad has the best display, the best battery life, the best industrial design, the best OS, etc. All for an unbelievable US$499. Can anyone beat that? I doubt it.</p>
