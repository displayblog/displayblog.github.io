<p>Test Freaks has a bunch of <a href="http://www.testfreaks.co.uk/monitors/">monitor reviews</a> and currently the Eizo FlexScan SX2262W has the highest aggregate "Freak Score" of 9.9 out of 10. Here's what the experts had to say about the SX2262W:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/digitallifestyle/reviews/index.cfm?reviewid=3223650&productid=3223742&pagtype=allchandate">MacWorld UK</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The screen provides 1,920 x 1,200 resolution so it will be good for watching high-definition video. The 12ms response time is a bit below average, so it probably won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be ideal for gamers who like to play high-speed action games, but its image quality and versatility will make it a good choice for design and photographic work.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://www.photoreview.com.au/reviews/peripherals/eizo-flexscan-sx2262w-monitor.aspx">PhotoReview</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>With its premium price of $1700, this monitor won't be an impulse buy. However Eizo's five-year warranty ensures your investment should be well protected. Serious photographers will find the professional-level image quality and array of advanced screen adjustments this monitor offers will meet the majority of their needs, now and in the future.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Eizo FlexScan SX2262W isn't for everyone, but if you're serious about color it should be on your short list.</p>
