<p>Andy Ihnatko, Chicago Sun-Times, writes about <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/technology/ihnatko/2017907,ihnatko-ipad-hands-on-012810.article#">his impressions regarding the iPad</a>, which he was able to play with after the iPad introduction:</p>
<blockquote><p>It has a feeling of being The Right Size. ... This is no cheap hunk of netbook plastic. ... Its weight is just fine. ... The display is gorgeous ... Viewing angles are immensely wide ... This really <em>is</em> the iPhone OS. ... Fast. Fast, fast, fast. ... it plays HD video smoothly and smartly. ... I'm not worried about the lack of Flash. ... As a consumer, I'm hoping that the iPad will indeed be the One True Thing.</blockquote><br />
Can't wait to get my hands on an iPad.</p>
