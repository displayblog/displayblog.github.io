<p><a href="http://www.the-digital-reader.com/2010/11/23/pocketbook-to-use-a-mirasol-screen-i-told-you-so/">The Digital Reader</a> &rarr; <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/24/pocketbook-spills-the-transflective-colored-beans-announces-mir/">Engadget</a>: PocketBook USA has announced its Qualcomm Mirasol display-based e-book reader in a CES 2011 press release. It seems PocketBook's e-book reader will be called Mirasol for now, but I doubt that will last since Qualcomm has invested significantly in marketing its Mirasol display technology.</p>
<p>Rumor has it that PocketBook's Mirasol will cost a bit (because the Qualcomm Mirasol display costs 1.5 times that of an equivalent-sized E Ink display) with refresh rates of about 12fps, which would not be fast enough for video. The color reflective e-reader from PocketBook will be announced at CES 2011 and is expected to be available in the third quarter of 2011.</p>
<p>PS: And at the end of it all PocketBook has stated that the company is not ready to confirm and stated the press release was an accident.</p>
