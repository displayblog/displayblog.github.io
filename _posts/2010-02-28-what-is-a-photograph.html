<p>David Pogue's <a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/25/photoshop-and-photography-when-is-it-real/">Photoshop and Photography: When Is It Real?</a> continues the discussion sparked by the March issue of Popular Photography in which Miriam Leuchter wrote an article titled "What Is a Photograph?" In the magazine's Reader's Photos Contest the winners in two of the categories were composites, or Photoshop jobs:</p>
<blockquote><p>One photo shows a motorcyclist being chased by a tornado; another shows a flock of seagulls wheeling around a lighthouse in amazingly photogenic formation. Neither scene ever actually existed as photographed.</blockquote><br />
Blasphemy.</p>
