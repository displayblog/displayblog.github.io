<p><a href="http://www.nttdocomo.co.jp/product/concept_model/sh08c/index.html">NTT Docomo</a>: The Sharp Touch Wood will be available in limited quantities of just 15,000 on NTT DoCoMo. Made of locally sourced cypress timber each Touch Wood will be unique due to the wood's unique pattern as well as color. I wonder if you're given the option to choose which Touch Wood based on grain and color.</p>
<p>It would have been even better if Sharp found a way to make a unibody version with the wood adorning the front as well. The Touch Wood sports a 3.4-inch 854x480 TFT LCD and a five megapixel camera with flash. Slated for a February-March, 2011 release.</p>
