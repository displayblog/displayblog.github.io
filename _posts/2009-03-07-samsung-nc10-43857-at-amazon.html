<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001O94FY8?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=displ0f-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001O94FY8">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/03/07/black-samsung-nc10-now-shipping-slightly-cheaper/">Engadget</a>: The Samsung NC10 is quite the popular netbook at Amazon and sells for $438.57. The NC10-14GBK packs a 10.2" TFT LCD, 1.6GHz Intel Atom N270 CPU, 1GB RAM, 160GB HDD, and Windows XP Home. Shipping is free.</p>
<p>The NC10 sports a 93% full-size keyboard, which is quite important since most netbooks make your fingers and wrists cramp up just after a little while of attempting to type.</p>
<p>The 10.2" TFT LCD sports a 1024 x 600 pixel format that is just right for Internet surfing but the 600 vertical pixels will require a bit of scrolling up and down.</p>
<p>The integrated GMA 945 GPU will not be powerful enough to drive 3D-intensive games or allow you to watch HD video but for Internet surfing, emailing, word processing and other light-duty applications the NC10 seems to be powerful enough.</p>
<p>Some users have upgraded the 1GB to 2GB and the 160GB HDD to a much larger one. If you are a tinkerer you can boost the performance of the already snappy NC10 to much higher levels.</p>
<p>There are a total of 199 customer reviews with 153 of them giving the NC10 a 5/5 starts. Reviewers liked the excellent build quality, excellent WiFi reception, sturdy and snappy keyboard keys, bright LCD...</p>
