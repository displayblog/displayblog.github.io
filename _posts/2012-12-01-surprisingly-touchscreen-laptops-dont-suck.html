<p>Sean Hollister, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/11/30/3710900/gorilla-arm-touchscreen-laptop-windows-8-apple">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If Microsoft can fix UI scaling, figure out a Retina Display alternative, or find other intelligent ways to allow users to consistently touch what they intend to touch, Windows could maintain the touchscreen lead.</blockquote></p>
<p>Microsoft is unifying its Windows UI/UX by borrowing heavily from how we interact with smartphones and tablets. We interact with smartphones and tablets with our fingers. Thanks primarily to Apple's work on the original iPhone our fingers are perfect for modern mobile operating systems such as iOS, Android, and Windows Phone. But what happens when you transplant that experience unto a notebook?</p>
<p>Not sucky.</p>
<p>Also, not inspiring. I'm not sure there is a touchscreen lead to be had on notebooks, all-in-ones, and monitors. I find fingerprints on my smartphone and tablet to be acceptable, but fingerprints on my notebook display? Quite annoying. A possible solution might be lipophobic coatings, but there is a more fundamental challenge.</p>
<p>A finger-based OS like Android works without precision; it was designed that way. But when precision work is required a finger isn't the right tool. Precision work requires precision tools like the keyboard, mouse, and stylus. I see notebooks, desktops, all-in-ones, pen displays (like the Wacom Cintiq) as tools designed for precision work and so adding finger touch capability seems odd.</p>
