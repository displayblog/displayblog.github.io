<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/03/12/dells-multi-touch-studio-one-19-pc/">Engadget</a>: Dell is upping its design and its products are looking quite good. The Adamo is a case in point. Now comes another beaut: the Studio One 19. The Studio One 19 is a 18.5-inch all-in-one that looks fantastic. It reminds me of an iMac but a more curved, rounded version. As you can see from the picture above the 18.5" LCD chassis houses the CPU that can be equipped up to a Core 2 Quad. The 18.5" LCD is limited to just 1366x768. There is a Blu-ray optical drive feature but that will be wasted with such a low-pixel count display. I hope Dell has a LCD option capable of 1080p.</p>
<p>Although the pixel count is limited you can manipulate those pixels via touch: the 18.5" LCD features multitouch. Very nice. Resistive? Capacitive? Don't know. You have some color options: black, blue, pink, red and white. This sexy all-in-one is available in Japan but will be coming to the US this spring. Exactly when is unknown but the price will be quite aggressive starting at just US$699. Good stuff Dell. Good stuff!</p>
