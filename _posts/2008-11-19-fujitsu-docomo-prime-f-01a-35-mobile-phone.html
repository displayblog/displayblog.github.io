<p><a href="http://www.akihabaranews.com/en/news_details.php?id=17048">Akihabara News</a>: The Fujitsu F-01A is a clam shell-type mobile phone with the ability to flip the main display around and lay it flat, like a tiny tablet. And like a tiny tablet the LCD is touch capable. The F-01A sports a 3.5" TFT LCD with a very high resolution sporting a pixel format of 854x480. That's more than 2x what you get with the iPhone. Can't wait until display manufacturers squeeze 1024x600 pixels onto a 3.5" LCD: good for browsing. The double-tap feature found on the iPhone would be a must-have feature to make good use of those pixels displaying a webpage. </p>
<p>There is also an external display: a monochrome OLED with a 174x64 pixel format. I like these displays because they tend to blend in much better than LCDs to their surroundings. I do remember some company coming out with a mobile phone that had an LCD that turned into a mirror... or was it just a mirror and not a LCD. Anyone remember?</p>

<p>The digital camera features a 5.2MP CMOS sensor, which should take some very good pictures. CMOS chips are used in DSLRs and tend to take much better pictures compared to CCD technology, which you can find in most compact digital cameras and mobile phones. Making sure your pictures turn out good are auto focus and face detection technologies. Want to take videos? The F-01A can take MPEG4 640x480 videos at 30fps. Tired of taking and want to simply enjoy some TV? The 1-Seg tuner will let you do just that. The F-01A has almost everything you'd want in a mobile phone. Well, except for a user-friendly OS, a QWERTY keyboard, WiFi, more storage, etc...</p>
<p>Personally, I think one of the best things about the F-01A is that it is IPx5 and IPx7 certified: if you accidentally drop it in water or if you accidentally drop water on it, no problem. IP stands for International Protection and IPx5 means that the product can resist a spray jet at a distance of 2.5m for 3 minutes in all directions. Basically, the IPx5-certified device can get splashed without problems. IPx7 is more stringent and devices that are IPx7 certified means that it can withstand accidental immersion in one meter of water for 30 minutes. I lost a iPhone 3G to water. Imagine how life would be if you didn't have to worry about water getting on your expensive high-tech gadgets. Apple, I got two words for you: IPx5, IPx7!</p>
