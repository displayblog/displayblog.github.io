<blockquote><p>It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not just a Powermat killer. It could potentially kill all chargers for mobile gadgets. Tonight we had a chance to get a demo of Wysips breakthrough technology, which layers a thin, transparent photovoltaic film on top of a phone&acirc;&euro;&trade;s display. This film captures solar energy&acirc;&euro;&ldquo;or even energy from a nearby light source&acirc;&euro;&ldquo;so you don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have to hunt for an outlet by the middle of the day. Maybe not ever again.</blockquote></p>
<p>According to Wysips it will take six hours of sunlight to completely charge a typical mobile phone battery. Larger batteries in power-hungry smartphones will most likely take longer. I wonder if size can be scaled. I'd like to see Wysip solar films on notebook PCs, too. So when? In about 12 months.</p>
