<blockquote><p>Worldwide sales of tablets to end users reached 195.4 million units in 2013, a 68 percent increase on 2012, according to Gartner, Inc. While sales of iOS tablets grew in the fourth quarter of 2013, iOS's share declined to 36 percent in 2013. The tablet growth in 2013 was fueled by the low-end smaller screen tablet market, and first time buyers; this led Android to become the No. 1 tablet operating system (OS), with 62 percent of the market [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>A single company, Apple, captured 36% of the world's tablet market in 2013. That's nothing to sneeze at, but there's another company posting incredible numbers. Gartner breaks down tablet sales market share in 2012 and 2013 by vendor:</p>
<ol>
<li>Apple: 52.8% &rarr; 36.0%</li>
<li>Samsung: 7.4% &rarr; 19.1%</li>
<li>ASUS: 5.4% &rarr; 5.6%</li>
<li>Amazon: 6.6% &rarr; 4.8%</li>
<li>Lenovo: 1.9% &rarr; 3.3%</li><br />
</ol></p>
<p>And Others make up 31.0% (up from 25.8% in 2012). Although Apple's 36.0% market share despite it being a Y/Y decline is still impressive, Samsung was the only company that experienced explosive growth: an amazing 336% Y/Y.</p>
