<p>Steve Wozniak via <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/18/exclusive-woz-misquoted-almost-every-app-that-i-have-is-bette/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Almost every app I have is better on the iPhone.</blockquote></p>
<p>There are stricter guidelines for iOS and much more at stake. If you screw up you'll get nailed. That being said a whole bunch of crappy iPhone apps do exist.</p>
<blockquote><p>I'm not trying to put Android down, but I'm certainly not saying Android is better than iOS by any stretch of the imagination. And it can get greater marketshare and still be crappy.</blockquote></p>
<p>The imperative word here is 'can' but probably won't since there are more non-techies than techies. When regular folks start to purchase smartphones Apple's got the edge simply because the iPhone is easier to use. That being said, there is one area that Apple needs to improve drastically and quickly: syncing. </p>
<p>Android is way ahead of iOS when it comes to syncing. Syncing needs to go from wired to wireless. A simple example would be the address book. The way it is now, I need to physically connect the iPhone to my MacBook, run iTunes and sync just to sync the two address books. How it needs to work: Apple has a free DropBox-like cloud service that syncs both address books so when I update one it gets automatically updated on the other. Android does it; iOS should, too.</p>
