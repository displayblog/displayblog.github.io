<p><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/windows-phone-tango-to-be-microsofts-lower-price-point-operating-system/10294">Mary-Jo Foley</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of my contacts who asked to remain anonymous said he believed there would be at least one and maybe two Tango releases hitting before the Windows Phone 8 Apollo release. He said Tango was &acirc;&euro;&oelig;all about Nokia&acirc;&euro;¬ù and focused on hitting <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/18/us-nokia-ceo-idUSTRE71H1BE20110218">the lower-price point for Windows Phones</a> that Microsoft and Nokia execs have been promising. My contact also said the Tango release may be focused largely or even exclusively on the Asian market.</blockquote></p>
<p>So Tango is code for an affordable Nokia-branded Windows Phone 7 smartphone targeted at emerging markets. China perhaps, where Nokia's brand is still leading the smartphone market, in terms of unit shipments. Will these Tango phones be subsidized or will they be unlocked and still be affordable?</p>
