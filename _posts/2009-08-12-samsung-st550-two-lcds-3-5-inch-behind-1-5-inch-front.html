<p><strong>Two Better Than One</strong><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=samsung&amp;sa=Search#1627"> Samsung</a>'s ST550 is a 12.2 megapixel <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=compact+digital+camera&amp;sa=Search#1642">compact digital camera</a> sporting a touch-enabled 3.5-inch LCD with haptic feedback on the back. The interesting thing about the ST550 (and the slightly lower-end ST500) is a 1.5-inch on the <em>front</em>. I believe this is an industry first and I'm scratching my head and wondering why it took so long. This is a brilliant idea by Samsung!</p>
<p><strong>Serves Two</strong> The front LCD can be used for two purposes. One, when you're trying to take a picture of yourself (and your wife) and you're the photographer it is almost always a trial and error process. Not if you can see yourself through a LCD on the front. Now you're self-portraits will always be pretty good. The second purpose would be to use the LCD on the front to help kids focus. You can display "cute animations" to do that. For that split second you need to snap a good picture.</p>
