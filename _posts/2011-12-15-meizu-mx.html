<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/12/15/meizu-mx-review/">Richard Lai, Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Following the evolution of most phones, one of the biggest physical changes from the M9 to the MX is the screen size increase, making a jump from 3.5 inches to 4 inches but preserving the same 960 x 640 resolution. Honestly, we aren't at all bothered by the drop in pixel density. If anything, we actually enjoyed the larger ASV LCD's improved viewing angles (which also beat the Xiaomi Phone's transflective LCD) and the slightly wider color range. Still, when placed side by side, the iPhone 4S's Retina Display and the HTC Incredible S's SLCD show more realistic colors; but frankly, the quality difference is far from a deal breaker and is hardly noticeable when the MX is on its own.</blockquote></p>
<p>I assume our hands aren't evolving to larger sizes, and our smartphones are meant to be used with our hands, so why are most smartphones getting bigger?</p>
<p>The resolution difference of putting 960x640 pixels on a 3.5-inch display and a 4.0-inch is: 326 v. 288 ppi, a 12% drop. The difference might seem small, but the drop in resolution crosses the 300-ppi 'Retina' line. With the 3.5-inch display at a distance of about 12 inches individual pixels can't be seen; with the 4.0-inch pixels are now visible.</p>
