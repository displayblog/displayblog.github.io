<blockquote><p>It seems to me that Siri is slowly entering this area of &acirc;&euro;&tilde;nice to show but not actually useful&acirc;&euro;&trade;. I know a quite few people with an iPhone 4S and I asked around a bit and they all almost regretfully acknowledge that they, in fact, don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t really use it anymore, once you get beyond the newness of it all.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote><p>I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t think Boris and his friends are a representative sample.</blockquote></p>
