<blockquote>
<p>The hardware reportedly stopped the team from innovating beyond certain points because it was slow and imposed constraints, which was highlighted when webOS was loaded on to Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s iPad device and found to run the platform significantly faster than the device for which it was originally developed.</p><br />

<p>webOS was run inside the Mobile Safari browser on the iPad, and it still ran faster than on the TouchPad. That's surprising. HP was no better than Palm when it came to building a device with hardware and OS tightly integrated to work well together.</p></p>

<blockquote>
<p>And I simply can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t believe that WebOS or any subset thereof running within MobileSafari would be faster than running natively on the TouchPad. I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t believe it. Show me.</p><br />
