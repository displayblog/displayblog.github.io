<p>Christina Warren has a nice writeup on <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/02/10/flappy-bird-story/">Mashable</a> about the rise and fall of the game Flappy Bird. At the end Dong Nguyen, the Vietnam-based developer of the game, chose simple and quiet over craziness and success. <a href="https://twitter.com/dongatory/statuses/432095426854912000">Dong Nguyen tweeted on February 8, 2014</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I can call &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Flappy Bird&acirc;&euro;&trade; is a success of mine. But it also ruins my simple life. So now I hate it.</blockquote></p>
<p>It wasn't the game that ruined Dong Nguyen's simple life, it was how the way the current system is set up: a certain level of popularity becomes overwhelming to the point of destruction.</p>
<p>PS: I was recently at a local Sprint store and it was there I was introduced to Flappy Bird. A few weeks before a good friend introduced me to Candy Crush. I spent about an hour playing the game and quickly realized how addictive it was and how much time I would waste playing it. So I deleted it off of my iPhone. I played Flappy Bird on an Android tablet and after about five minutes I realized the same thing I did with Candy Crush: The game is frustrating, but in an highly addictive way. I could see myself wasting my life away making this bird flap its wings. So I stopped. But to my surprise, after I found out Dong Nguyen was pulling Flappy Bird from the App Store and Google Play, I downloaded them. I've spent another five minutes (total) flapping the wings of the cute bird. I don't think I will be playing Flappy Bird much, but I am glad I can when I want to.</p>
