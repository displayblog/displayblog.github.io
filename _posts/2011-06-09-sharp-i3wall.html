<p><a href="http://en.akihabaranews.com/97627/displays/dsj-2011-sharp-demonstrate-in-japan-its-i3wall">Akihabara News</a>: The Sharp i3Wall is made up of 60-inch PN-V601 or PN-V602 LCDs and was showcased at Digital Signage Japan 2011. A similar setup can be found at the Hui Ten Bosch Theme Park in Nagasaki.</p>
<p>PS: For some reason the embedded Vimeo video does not work on mobile Safari on my iPhone 4. Here is the error message:</p>
<blockquote><p>The creator of this video has not given you permission to embed it on this domain. This is a Vimeo Plus feature.</blockquote></p>
<p>This message is bogus because the video works on Safari on my MacBook Pro.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> I have removed the Vimeo-hosted video that was originally embedded because there are times when it works and other times when it doesn't.</p>
