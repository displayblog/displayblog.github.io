<p>On June 12, 2008, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=asus">ASUS</a> announced its LS221H 22" <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-monitor">LCD monitor</a> and claimed it the world's slimmest 22" wide LCD monitor. Slim is in and in my opinion very good. We have too many things taking up too much of our precious space. Advancement toward slimming down our fat gadgets is a good thing! The LS221H is just 248mm or 0.97" thick, which is quite a bit thinner than most 22" LCD monitors. For example, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/05/08/samsung-ln22a650-22-lcd-tv/">Samsung's LN22A650</a> has a thickness of 8.5". So we're looking at a very impressive thickness reduction for the LS221H.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dynamic-contrast">dynamic contrast</a> ratio called ASUS Smart Contrast Ratio (ASCR) is rated at 4000:1 and should yield good images. Like most other 22" LCD monitors, the LS221H uses a TN LCD panel that results in a viewing angle of 170/160, not bad but not great. The 2ms gray to gray (GTG) response time is impressive. I would like to note that ASUS has a protective glass over the front of the LS221H that has a hardness rating of 9H, which is very hard and resistant to scratches.</p>
