The 22" SCALEOVIEW Q22W-1 will be launching on August 30, 2007 according to Fujitsu Siemens. The name SCALEOVIEW is a bit lacking in professionalism, but the features of this 22" wide <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-monitor">LCD monitor</a> seem to very focused on communication and entertainment. With the high-quality camera built-in (and good video chatting software) the user can easily video chat and there are microphones to boot. The DVI and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=hdmi">HDMI</a> inputs allow for this monitor to be used as the display for DVDs, HD-DVDs, Blu-ray disks, PS3 and about anything else that has video out. The panel is most likely a TN type with a wide viewing angle film to improve the limited viewing angle from just TN alone. At &Acirc;&pound;299, it is very expensive and a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dell">Dell</a> Ultrasharp 20" wide might be a better value: even though you are losing 2", you are not losing any screen real estate as the pixel format is identical and you get better LCD technology: S-IPS from LG.Philips LCD or <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=pva">PVA</a> from Samsung.</p>
