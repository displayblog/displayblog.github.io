<blockquote><p>Exchanges are a bad idea right now. I recommend that you wait. If you have an iPad 2 that is usable, don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t rush to replace it. You&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll be wasting your time. I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t think Apple can deliver an iPad 2 with a good display right now.</blockquote></p>
<p>It seems there is <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/03/12/ipad-2-lcd-light-bleeding/">a backlight problem</a> in more than a few iPad 2s.</p>
