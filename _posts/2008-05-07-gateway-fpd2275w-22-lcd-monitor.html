<p>TigerDirect just sent me an email showing a $179.99 price on Gateway's FPD2275W 22" LCD monitor. The unit is refurbished, but that just means whatever that could have gone wrong did go wrong and Gateway fixed it and now you don't have to worry about it. I personally like refurbished products because they are practically brand new and are much much cheaper. Of course the one downside is that the warranty is usually quite a bit less than if you were to purchase the more expensive non-refurbished version.</p>
<p>The FPD2275W isn't anything special but it does have a lot of input ports that allow you to connect multiple video sources. It does lack HDMI, so PS3 and XBox 360 users who want to connect via HDMI are out of luck with this ultra-cheap 22" LCD monitor.</p>
