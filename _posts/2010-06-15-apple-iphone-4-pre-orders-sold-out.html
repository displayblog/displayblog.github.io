<p>According to <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/15/apple-iphone-4-pre-orders-now-sold-out/">Engadget</a> the iPhone 4 pre-orders are already sold out in the US at Apple Stores and AT&amp;T. That was quick. No problemo since I am waiting for the white one, which will probably sell out too once made available.</p>
<p>Just to make sure I went over to Apple just now. It is 3:15 pm in Korea and 11:15 pm in Cupertino, CA. It asked me for my wireless number, billing zip code and last four of my social security number and checked to see if I was eligible for the iPhone 4 upgrade. Not surprisingly, I was. I picked the US$15.00 per month 200MB data plan, the $5.00 per month 200 message plan, and it went off processing my request. I also need to pay a one-time upgrade fee of $18.00. AT&amp;T... nickel and dimin' me. After a little bit, here's the message I got:</p>
<blockquote><p>We were unable to complete set up online. To finish creating your account, you'll need to visit an Apple Retail Store where we can help you in person.</blockquote><br />
And then right next to it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Currently, there are no reservations available. But you can still pick up an iPhone on a first-come, first-served basis at your favorite Apple Retail Store starting at 7 a.m. on June 24. And since you've already set up your account online, you'll save time when you stop by the store.</blockquote><br />
A bit confusing since the first message is telling me I haven't already set up my account. But it seems to be true: iPhone 4 pre-orders are sold out. Guess I'll need to wait, a while. You know what I would love to see and would be willing to wait for for quite some time?&Acirc;&nbsp;An all-stainless steel version. How about it Steve?</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5564262/apple-iphone-4-order-security-breach-exposes-private-information">Gizmodo</a> is reporting that those attempting to pre-order an iPhone 4 were being logged into other people's accounts. The cause? Possibly due to a major fraud prevention overhaul of AT&amp;T's software that was implemented last weekend and was taken live without any testing prior to the launch of the iPhone 4. Of course, AT&amp;T is responding that it isn't able to duplicate the issue and is looking into it. After reading this I promptly went to check my account and thankfully nothing seems to be amiss. I would urge you to do the same just to be on the safe side. And a word about AT&amp;T: the carrier has not been able to maintain operations regarding Apple's products. The security breach with the iPad is fresh in our memory and now this with the iPhone 4. I think it is about just the right time a competitor came along and drop-kicked some sense into AT&amp;T.</p>
<p><em>Another Update</em>: Apple moved more than 600,000 iPhone 4 pre-orders in a single day. Here's what Apple has to say about it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yesterday Apple and its carrier partners took pre-orders for more than 600,000 of Apple's new iPhone 4. It was the largest number of pre-orders Apple has ever taken in a single day and was far higher than we anticipated, resulting in many order and approval system malfunctions. Many customers were turned away or abandoned the process in frustration. We apologize to everyone who encountered difficulties, and hope that they will try again or visit an Apple or carrier store once the iPhone 4 is in stock.</blockquote><br />
The ship date has slipped from July 2 to July 14. I'm still waiting for my white iPhone 4 to be available.</p>
