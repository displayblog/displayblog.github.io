<p><a href="http://fosspatents.blogspot.com/2011/10/itc-judge-rules-against-htcs-first.html">Florian Mueller, FOSS Patents</a>: The ITC ruled Apple did not violate four HTC patents. Apple is not willing to license its patents, especially the valuable ones. Google's help might be too little, too late. Good news for Apple; bad news for Android.</p>
