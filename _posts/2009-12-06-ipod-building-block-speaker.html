<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8301" title="iPod_Building_Block_Speaker_BW" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/iPod_Building_Block_Speaker_BW.jpg" alt="iPod_Building_Block_Speaker_BW" width="300" height="300" />There are many tech gifts, too many actually. But there are few really nifty ones. <a href="http://igadgetlife.com/gadgets/other/budget-friendly-tech-gift-ideas/">iGadget Life</a> lists a few budget-friendly ones and the iPod Building Block Speaker caught my eye. It adds a playful design to the ultra-sleek high-tech iconic MP3 player today, Apple's iPod. The iPod Building Block Speaker is priced at just US$14.99 at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001I9ZAWK?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=displ0f-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001I9ZAWK">Amazon</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=displ0f-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B001I9ZAWK" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />. A great stocking stuffer for not a lot of money.</p>
<p>Compatible with iPod mini, iPod touch (1st gen), iPod nano (1st, 2nd, 3rd gen), iPod (3rd, 4th, 5th gen), iPod Classic.</p>
