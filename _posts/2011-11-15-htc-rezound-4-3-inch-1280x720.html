<blockquote><p>Of course, such high pixel density means that you won't be able to see pixelation with the naked eye, and it's obvious with the Rezound's display. Watching an HD-quality video, as expected, is absolutely stunning; everything appears more life-like, and it's easier to see finer details such as freckles and little hairs. Text turns out incredibly crisp, and it's the most noticeable with smaller fonts; when viewing Engadget, for instance, tiny print appears just as smooth as it does when we zoom in. It's a more satisfying visual experience than seen on the Vivid, which shows more and more jagged edges as the text gets smaller.</blockquote></p>
<p>4.3-inch Super LCD. 1280x720 pixels with RGB sub-pixels. 342 ppi. The display is a tad big for my taste, but with these display specs I'm expecting nothing but an absolutely fantastic visual experience.</p>
<p>The future when it comes to pixel format is clear: It's 1280x720. As display manufacturing technology advances expect 1280x720 to be packed into smaller and smaller displays. At some point 960x640 on the iPhone 4/4S will look anemic. The hardware spec will look anemic, not the visual experience. That will remain superb, just not has superb as time goes on and as more and more of the competition incorporates 1280x720. This difference will manifest itself most acutely when viewing 720p HD videos, which will be the next evolutionary step for Amazon, Hulu, iTunes, etc.</p>
