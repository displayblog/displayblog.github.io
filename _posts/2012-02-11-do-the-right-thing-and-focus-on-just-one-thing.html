<blockquote><p>Oh, I learned so much from Steve. It was a blessing to get to work for 12 years with, you know, one of the greatest people our country has ever had. But the most important thing he told me was to trust your intuition and do the right thing. Steve just said if you do the right thing and focus on just one thing at a time you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re best, you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll end up in a really good place.</blockquote></p>
