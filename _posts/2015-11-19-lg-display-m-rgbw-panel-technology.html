<p>Full Disclosure: LG Display is a client of mine at the time of this writing. There has been some confusion in the market regarding the company's M+ technology and at the request of LG Display I have written this article for clarification. This article has been edited only by me.</p>
<p><em>What is M+?</em></p>
<p>M+ is LG Display's sub-pixel panel technology that uses four sub-pixels rather than three. Most displays use three sub-pixels: red, green, and blue. This RGB sub-pixel arrangement in a 3x1 layout is often referred to as RGB stripe. Three sub-pixels make a single pixel, physically&nbsp;and visually.&nbsp;M+ on the other hand uses four sub-pixels: red, green, blue, and white, or RGBW. And a pixel can have a different mix of RGBW.</p>
<p>For instance, the first pixel in a M+ panel starts off with  RGB, and the next one to the right is WRG, and then BWR, GBW, etc. The diagram in this PDF (<a href="http://lgdnewsroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/LG-Display-Addresses-Environmental-Issues-with-G_FN.pdf">LG Display Addresses Environmental Issues with M+</a>) should help with visualizing the structure.</p>
<p><em>Why M+?</em></p>
<p>The benefits of&nbsp;adding a white sub-pixel are brightness and cost. Right now as I am writing this article on WordPress roughly 90% of my screen -- a 15.4" 1920x1200 LCD -- is white, which means light is passing through all three sub-pxiels; remember all three primary colors (red, green, and blue) are required to make white. Pushing photons through a RGB color filter is inefficient; about&nbsp;60-70% of light&nbsp;gets blocked. The light transmittance rate further declines when more pixels are added to the same screen. The trend going from 1080p (1920x1080) to 4K/UHD (4096x2160/3840x2160) is a good example.</p>
<p>Light is generated by a backlight. Roughly speaking, a&nbsp;10,000 cd/m2 LED backlight will result in a 500 cd/m2 screen. That translates to a 5% light transmittance rate. It doesn't help that the backlight is the most expensive component of a LCD.</p>
<p>The transition from 1080p to 4K/UHD adds a lot of pixels. A 1080p set will sport a 1920x1080 pixel format for a total of 2,073,600 pixels. A 4K/UHD set has 8,847,360 pixels (4096x2160) or 8,294,400 pixels (3840x2160). That's more than quadruple the number of pixels, and puts pressure on the backlight to generate enough light.</p>
<p>M+ is the result of the transition to 4K/UHD and the need to reduce the cost related to the backlight to bring to market affordable 4K TVs. The addition of a white sub-pixel improves the light transmittance rate to 8%. Assume the same brightness target of say 1000 cd/m2 on a 4K/UHD TV, M+ translates to lower backlight costs by reducing the number of LEDs and/or optical films compared to a panel that uses a RGB stripe configuration.</p>
<p>Skyworth, Konka, Hisense, Haier, Xiamoi, and Philips are&nbsp;using LG Display's M+ LCD panels for their 4K/UHD TV lineup. I expect 4K/UHD TV prices to continue falling, and at some point -- US$499 50-inch 4K/UHD? -- prices will hit an inflection point, from which there will be mass adoption.</p>
<p><em>Is M+ 4K/UHD real 4K/UHD?</em></p>
<p>This is the question that requires some clarification. Let's compare four pixels in a row. On a&nbsp;M+ panel the four pixels would be&nbsp;made of these four sub-pixel sets:&nbsp;RGB,&nbsp;WRG,&nbsp;BWR,&nbsp;GBW. On a RGB stripe it would be: RGB, RGB, RGB, RGB. Now let's count the sub-pixels:</p>
<ul>
<li>M+: R (3), G (3), B (3), W (3)</li>
<li>RGB Stripe: R (4), G (4), B (4)</li><br />
</ul><br />
RGB has a total of 12 sub-pixels. The composition of the sub-pixels are different, but the total number of sub-pixels in the M+ example is also 12. The white sub-pixel is also a sub-pixel though its purpose is slightly different.</p>
<p>When the screen is mostly white, like my screen at the moment, the white pixels are used to make it brighter without using more power. The white sub-pixel also increases the difference in brightness between pixels to enhance image sharpness.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom's Intertek, Germany's T&Uuml;V (Technischer &Uuml;berwachungsverein), China's CESI (China Electronics Standardization Institute), and the United States' UL organizations have certified LG Display's 4K/UHD M+ as real 4K/UHD.</p>
<p>I don't blindly trust international organizations, but the ones mentioned above have some credibility. I highly recommend taking a look for yourself. The most important question should be: How does a 4K/UHD TV using a M+ panel look to you?</p>
