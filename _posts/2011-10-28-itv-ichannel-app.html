<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2011/10/apps_are_the_new_channels">John Gruber</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Imagine watching a baseball game on a TV where ESPN is a smart app, not a dumb channel. When you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re watching a game, you could tell the TV to show you the career statistics for the current batter. You could ask the HBO app which other movies this actress has been in. Point is: it&acirc;&euro;&trade;d be better for both viewers and the networks1 if a TV &acirc;&euro;&oelig;channel&acirc;&euro;¬ù were an interactive app rather than a mere single stream of video.</blockquote></p>
<p>I would not want the game or TV episode I'm watching to be cluttered up with statistics and other 'useful' information. I don't even like the shiny logo glued unto the bezel of the TV. Wouldn't it be better if useful information like batter statistics showed up on my iPhone, or iPad instead?</p>
