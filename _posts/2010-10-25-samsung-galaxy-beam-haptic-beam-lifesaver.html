<p><a href="http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2010/10/22/2010102200286.html">The Chosunilbo</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to U.S. and Chilean media, among the items sent through a hole to help the 33 trapped miners stay alive was a Samsung beam projector cell phone.</p>
<p>The phone sent to the miners contained a message of encouragement from Chile&acirc;&euro;&trade;s mining minster. It also enabled the trapped men to watch movies and a recording of a friendly soccer match between Chile and Ukraine.</blockquote></p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
