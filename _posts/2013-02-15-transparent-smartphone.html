<p>Nicole Scott, <a href="http://mobilegeeks.com/transparent-smartphone-prototype-polytron-hands-video/">Mobile Geeks</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Transparent display&acirc;&euro;&trade;s are coming and we are hardly able to control our excitement that Taiwanese company, <a href="http://www.polytron.com.tw/">Polytron Technologies</a>, is working to produce a completely transparent Smartphone. We went down to Taoyuan about 35 min from Taipei by the airport to check out a prototype of their transparent Smartphone.</blockquote></p>
<p>By far the largest component in a smartphone, except for the display, is the battery. Take a look at <a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone-5-Teardown/10525">iFixit's iPhone 5 teardown</a> and you'll see the battery is enormous compared to the other components inside. Unless the battery itself becomes transparent a transparent smartphone will remain science fiction.</p>
<p>But some science fiction does become reality, and transparent batteries will eventually enable transparent smartphones. In 2011 <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/news/2011/july/transparent-litiumion-battery-072511.html">Stanford researches invented a transparent lithium-ion battery</a>. The question is a matter of when, not if, a transparent battery will become commercially available and affordable enough to power a transparent smartphone.</p>
