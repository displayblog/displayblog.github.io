<p>Consumer Reports &rarr; <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/consumer-reports-macbooks-are-the-best-notebooks-you-can-buy-in-any-category/48385">Cult of Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Consumer Reports may not recommend the iPhone 4, but if you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re looking for pretty much any laptop, the message is clear: Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s making the best notebooks in every category that money can buy.</blockquote></p>
<p>Netbook consumers would disagree since there isn't a sub-$500 notebook from Apple, but Steve would recommend you buy an iPad instead.</p>
