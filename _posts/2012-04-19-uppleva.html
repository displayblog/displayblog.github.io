<p><a href="http://youtu.be/0Nm7-EuctOs">UPPLEVA</a>, a more integrated TV experience, by IKEA. I like it. Give me less options so I can forget about everything and be engrossed by the amazing stories I will be watching.</p>
<p>The integrated Blu-ray player might be cause for concern: What if the optical disk format changes? That's a valid concern, but not really. The future is non-optical.</p>
<p>What about TV technology? Isn't the future OLED? Yes, but it'll be a long time before most of us can afford one. In the mean time enjoy the built-in LCD TV. When OLED TVs become affordable you can get one, put it in the living room, and move the LCD TV UPPLEVA to your kid's bedroom. Problem solved.</p>
