<p>On March 20, 2009, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) announced that Asanga Padmaperuma, a scientist at PNNL, and his colleagues have designed, synthesized and tested a new blue phosphorescent OLED material with a power effiency that is at least 25% enhanced relative to today's typical blue <a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3Autpr0mvi0e9&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=oled&amp;sa=Search">OLED</a> material. By combining red, green and blue OLED materials a white OLED can be manufactured. White OLEDs can be used for general lighting. Lighting consumes about 20% of the electricity that is generated in the United States. Shifting that from CCFL to LED and then finally to OLED can significantly reduce the energy consumption by lighting. In addition, with a more efficient blue OLED material we can expect longer-lasting OLED displays as well as the potential of OLEDs to be used as the backlight in LCDs.</p>
