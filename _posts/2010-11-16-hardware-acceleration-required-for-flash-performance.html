<p>Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen as quoted on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/16/adobe-ceo-flash-battery-life-depends-on-hardware-acceleration/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When we have access to hardware acceleration, we've proven that Flash has equal or better performance on every platform.</blockquote></p>
<p>I wonder why Flash sucks on my MacBook Pro; it has been on the market for more than a year.</p>
