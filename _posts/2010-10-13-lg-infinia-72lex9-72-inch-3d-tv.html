<p>The LG 72LEX9 is a 72-inch LED-backlit 3D LCD TV. Frequency is at 400/480Hz. The 72LEX9 makes use of a full LED backlight that has an array of LEDs pumping light out from the back. BTW, this is the type of LED backlight you'd want in a TV for good contrast and dark black levels. Pricing has not been determined and LG expects to release it in the second quarter of 2011. I don't know exactly why but I'm not excited about bringing 3D into my home. Source: <a href="http://www.cybertheater.com/lg-infinia-72lex9-72-inch-led-hdtv/">CyberTheater.com</a></p>
