<p><a href="http://ledsmagazine.com/news/4/8/21">LEDs Magazine</a>: ANC Sports Enterprises and Mitsubishi Electric Diamond Vision Systems will be installing a high definition 4-screen LED scoreboard wall using 6mm pitch LEDs at Verizon Center, Washington, D.C. The LED video wall will be the very first indoor high definition LED display scoreboard.&Acirc;&nbsp; The LED scoreboard will measure 14 feet, 5 inches high by 25 feet, 2 inches wide, with a total area of 365 square feet and a pixel format of 1280 x 736, that's 720p capable. Nice.</p>
