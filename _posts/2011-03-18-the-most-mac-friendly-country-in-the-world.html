<p><a href="http://royal.pingdom.com/2011/03/16/the-10-most-mac-friendly-countries-on-the-planet/">Pingdom</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We looked at desktop OS market share data from StatCounter, which is based on visitor stats from more than three million websites. To get up-to-date numbers, we focused on the month of February, 2011.</p>
<p>Doing this, we ended up with the following top 10 countries in terms of Mac market share: Switzerland, Luxembourg, the United States, Iceland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Denmark and Singapore.</blockquote></p>
<p>Well, this is only for the month of February and there is a big variable: surfing. What if Mac users in other countries are faster in adopting iPads, using them to surf instead? What if Mac users in other countries don't surf as much? What if Mac users who do surf surf other websites that aren't part of the three million tracked by StatCounter? There are <em>significantly</em> more websites than three million. According to some there are over 20 <em>billion</em>. </p>
<p>Only Apple would know which country loves Macs the most. Please do tell.</p>
