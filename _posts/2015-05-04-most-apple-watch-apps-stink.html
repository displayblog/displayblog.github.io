<blockquote><p>Just about every major app, from Twitter to Instagram to Starbucks, has an app for the Apple Watch. So far, there are about 3,500 apps available, and most stink.</blockquote></p>
<p>There must be something different with me. Yesterday, I had a hunch my friend had purchased an Apple Watch and asked her to pull up her sleeve. There it was: a 38 mm Watch Sport with a white sport band. She shared what she liked about it and what she didn't like about it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can't recollect most of the details except for one: she mentioned it was the best smartwatch she has worn. But what I realized later on, and what I later shared with my wife, was that there was absolutely no craving in my heart to get one. It was a strange realization because normally there would at least be a small tug in there somewhere saying, "You need to get one." Weird. Maybe Apple Watch 2 will be more desirable. Maybe not.</p>
