<p><a href="http://jkontherun.com/2010/02/03/motorola-devours-verizons-droid-brand-with-new-motoblur-phone/">jkOnTheRun</a>: Motorola's Devour is an Android-based smartphone with the Motoblur UI headed for Verizon. Like the Droid, Devour has a built-in QWERTY keyboard that is revealed with you slide up the LCD. Speaking of LCD, Devour isn't quite up to snuff in this department: 3.1-inch TFT LCD with a 480 x 320 (landscape) pixel format. Sure, the number of pixels is the same as the iPhone's display but I consider the iPhone to be lagging in that department too. The smallish 3.1-inch LCD has capacitive touch technology but mated to Android 1.6: multitouch out-of-the-box is questionable. A 3 megapixel camera is onboard, a bit less pixels compared to the Droid's 5 megapixel camera, but we all know it isn't all about the number of pixels on the image sensor. The iPhone 3GS' 3.2 megapixel camera does a fantastic job and even bests the Nexus One's (see <a href="/2010/01/21/andy-ihnatko-compares-iphone-3gs-and-nexus-one-photo-capabilities/"><em>Andy Ihnatko Compares iPhone 3GS and Nexus One Photo Capabilities</em></a>).</p>
<p>I'm sure Motorola did not want to cannibalize Droid sales, but Devour could have had a better chance of success with a better display. And why are the locations of the four recommend buttons different from Android smartphone to Android smartphone? For instance the back button on Devour is farthest right; on the Nexus One it is farthest left. The icons are also not standardized. What does that blue line mean? Google has a lot of room to improve in providing a seamless Android experience across different branded smartphones.</p>
