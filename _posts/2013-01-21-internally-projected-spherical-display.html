<p>Mark Vanhoenacker, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/08/science/digital-globes-a-new-way-to-view-the-world.html">The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Digital globes have obvious relevance to earth sciences and astronomy. But their potential in other subject areas is already being exploited. In China, where digital globes have found particular favor in schools, less than half the lesson plans are science-based, said Mr. Foody (in an ironic reversal of globalization&acirc;&euro;&trade;s typical tide, around 80 percent of Global Imagination&acirc;&euro;&trade;s orders are bound for China). Chinese schools use them mostly to teach social sciences, like the geography of religion and language, and history.</blockquote></p>
<p>Visually compelling, but wallet flattening:</p>
<ul>
<li>24-inch diameter HyperGlobe from <a href="http://www.iglobeinc.com/Site/home+.html">iGlobe</a>: ~US$43,000</li>
<li>32-inch OmniGlobe from <a href="http://www.arcscience.com/">ARC Science</a>: ~$40,000</li>
<li>24-inch Magic Planet from <a href="http://www.globalimagination.com/">Global Imagination</a>: ~$21,000</li><br />
</ul></p>
