<blockquote><p>Customers can access freely to the computer graphic images of the complicated process on the iPad installed in the store.</blockquote></p>
<p>At first I didn't know what that meant. Then I took a closer look at the clothes designed by Issey Miyake. I am not certain, but the clothes seem to fold flat. The iPad is there to show customers the transformation from 2D to 3D.</p>
<p>The store was designed by Tokujin Yoshioka. The simple and elegant installation fits well with the design of both iPad and interior. And, of course, the iPad was chosen because there is nothing else with more panache.</p>
<p>PS: <a href="http://www.isseymiyake.com/">Issey Miyake's official site</a> is pure Flash. The irony.</p>
