<p><a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1665324/reading-steve-jobs-the-upside-of-unreasonable-demands">Cliff Kuang, Co. Design</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But there's a distinction to be made between the demands one places on average talent and the demands you place on exceptional talent. The latter needs to be pushed, because exceptionally talented people can unwittingly settle on what comes easy to them. [...] Jobs knew that: He always thought that his own impossible demands had a way of weeding out everyone who didn't want to exceed their own expectations.</blockquote></p>
<p>Distinguishing exceptional from average is the trick.</p>
