<p><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57487895-37/malfunction-not-ipad-played-greater-role-in-galaxy-returns/">Steven Musil, CNET</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Confusion with Apple's iPad appears to have played less of a role in returns of Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1 than has previously been suggested.</p>
<p>Device malfunction was cited nearly three times more than a desire to exchange a Tab for an Apple iPad among the greatest reasons for returns, according to a study conducted by Samsung at Best Buy Stores in 2011.</blockquote></p>
<p>Not only does the Samsung Galaxy Tab look absolutely nothing like the iPad, it doesn't work like one either.</p>
