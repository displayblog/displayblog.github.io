<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dell">Dell</a>'s G2410 is a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=24"-lcd-monitor">24" LCD Monitor</a> with a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led-backlight">LED backlight</a> and sporting a pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a> making it another 1080p LCD monitor. The transition to 16:9 for all large LCD monitors is definite. The G2410 is touted as a green LCD monitor thanks to the LEd backlight. Dell is claiming that the G2410 (along with the smaller 22" G2210) consumes just 50% of the power that regular LCD monitors consume. In this type of economy any help in reducing cost goes a long way. I'm not quite convinced of the 1,000,000:1 <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dynamic-contrast">dynamic contrast</a> ratio but Dell does explain it by stating that the, "Dynamic dimming automatically decreases the onscreen brightness when the image consists primarily of white and/or bright areas when enabled." A bit confusing as to when dynamic dimming is activated. It seems as thought it is not <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=local-dimming">local dimming</a> but instead dimming of the entire backlight. If this is infact true, the one million to one dynamic contrast ratio might be a bit exaggerated. Let me know if I am wrong. The $359 price seems quite aggressive.</p>
