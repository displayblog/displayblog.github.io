<blockquote><p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Marc is without question one of the most influential designers of this generation,&acirc;&euro; Ive said in a statement provided to VF Daily. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;He is extraordinarily talented. We are particularly excited to formalize our collaboration as we enjoy working together so much and have found our partnership so effective.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
