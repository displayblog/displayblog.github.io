<p>AEG and Syntax-Brillian Corp., a manufacturer and        marketer of LCD and LCoS<span>&acirc;&bdquo;&cent; HDTVs and digital        entertainment products, announced a marketing        partnership that feature the company<span>&acirc;&euro;&trade;s        Olevia<span>&acirc;&bdquo;&cent; brand throughout AEG-owned assets across the        nation. To name a few of AEG properties: L.A. Live, STAPLES Center, the Los Angeles Kings, Red        Bull Park, Sprint Center, Citizen<span>&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Business        Bank Arena and the Amgen Tour of California.       The agreement extends through 2010 and will highlight the Olevia<span>&acirc;&bdquo;&cent; brand        through signage, brand exposure and        integration of Olevia<span>&acirc;&bdquo;&cent; TVs into AEG-owned public spaces. The central component of the partnership was        the sponsorship opportunities and elements which will be highlighted at        L.A. Live, the four million square foot $2.5 billion development across the street from the Los Angeles        Convention Center. L.A. Live features a 54        story/1,000-room convention center<span>,<span> Club Nokia, a 2,200 capacity live        music venue, a 15-screen Regal Cineplex, broadcast facilities for ESPN,        along with entertainment, restaurant, residential and office space and        the 7,100-seat Nokia Theatre.</p>
<p>AEG, a sports and entertainment presenters, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Anschutz Company, owns or        controls a collection of companies including facilities such as STAPLES        Center, The Forum (as exclusive booking agent for sports and        entertainment programming), Toyota Sports Center, Anaheim Arena (as        preferred booking agent), NOKIA Theatre Times Square, NOKIA Theatre at        Grand Prairie and Toyota Park.</p>
<p>I think this is a "brilliant" move by Syntax-Brillian as it will bolster its brand to potential customers that matter: folks who love sports. Of course, we all know that they will need to defer purchasing decisions to the wife, if married.</p>
