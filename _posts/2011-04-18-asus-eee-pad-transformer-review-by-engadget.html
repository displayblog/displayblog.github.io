<blockquote><p>When ASUS' pricing for the Eee Pad Transformer became known at &Acirc;&pound;380, the immediate reaction among our staff was puzzlement at the company's ability to fit a 10.1-inch IPS screen within such a tight budget -- quite aside from the other spec goodies already outlined above. The actual display did not disappoint, either, with a beautiful, well saturated picture that maintained its vibrancy even as you tilt the tablet to test out ASUS' promised 178-degree viewing angles. Some brightness is lost at extreme angles, but it's a true IPS panel, of that there is no doubt. It's gorgeous enough to make the Xoom press its own power button and skulk off into a dark corner.</blockquote></p>
<p>It's good to see ASUS ensuring the visual experience of the Eee Pad Transformer is excellent by integrating an IPS LCD. On the other hand, ASUS and others must know it is the utter simplicity of the iPad that makes it so popular. The iPad's hardware combined with a dead-simple iOS UI makes it usable for everyone, from the very young to the not-so-young. On the other hand, the Eee Pad Transformer caters well to those who don't mind a bit of complexity and want both a tablet and a netbook.</p>
