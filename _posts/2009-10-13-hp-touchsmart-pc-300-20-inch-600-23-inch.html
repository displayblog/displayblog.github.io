<p>HP UK (<a href="http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/uk/en/ho/WF05a/12454-12454-3352963-3352964-3352964-4002827.html">TouchSmart 300</a>, <a href="http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/uk/en/ho/WF05a/12454-12454-3352963-3352964-3352964-3929181.html">600</a>): Touch-enabled 23-inch BrightView TFT LCD with 1920x1080 resolution, NVIDIA GeForce 9400, 2x DDR3 SODIMM sockets, 6-in-1 memory card reader, Gigabit Ethernet, and USB 2.0 (6). The TouchSmart PC 300 has a touch-enabled 20-inch BrightView with 1600x900 resolution. A 1600x900 is really good for nothing when it comes to watching HD so if you can afford it, get the larger 23-inch version.</p>
<p>The art of creating a good product name is no more. A good product name would not only help identify what the product is but help customers easily distinguish one from another. What does the 300 after TouchSmart PC stand for? How about TouchSmart PC 20i? And 23i for the 23-inch version? That sounds smart. I go to HP's site to find out more detailed information about the TouchSmart PCs and I get model numbers like these: IQ504, IQ506, IQ804, IQ816. *sigh*</p>
<p>Instead of reaching for your mouse, just reach out and touch the LCD. You can pinch, rotate, arc, flip, press or drag a finger across the screen. So what are some things you can do with a multitouch all-in-one? Watch movies using Hulu Desktop and/or Netflix! Isn't it interesting that we would rather look for the lost remote control, and spend considerable time doing it, than to actually go to the TV and change channels? Well, I'm not sure that we would want to get up, go to our TouchSmart PC and use our fingers to flip channels, change volumes, etc. on Hulu Desktop or Netflix. I just don't see it. I'd rather sit down, relax and control the thing with my remote! Maybe it's just me. After the break: Social? Music? Cooking! Cool...</p>
<p>So multitouch and movie watching might not go great together. How about social networking like Twitter? Tweeting is about typing (just a little bit) so you'll need to get on the keyboard. What's multitouch got to do with anything?</p>
<p>Okay, multitouch isn't going to revolutionize the way you tweet. How about music? I say it is the same thing with music as it is with TV. We use our remotes, even when we have our iPods, we want our remotes: the ones integrated into our earphones. When we're using our stereo, we want to click next on our remotes to get to the next song while we're reading our Kindles. We don't want get up from our comfy couch, walk up to the stereo to get to the next song or change the volume. Do we want to do that on our PCs? We want a remote. So multitouch is a waste listening to music on a PC. In my opinion.</p>
<p>Now here is some interesting stuff. RecipeBox! Yes, aspiring chefs, this is for you! You can "discover, explore and keep track of recipes saved from multiple websites and cook with a hands-free experience via voice commands." I'm glad they made it hands-free but then multitouch is, again, a complete waste. Voice commands don't work 100% of the time and when you're working with a sharp object, like a knife, and your computer keeps telling you that you're saying something wrong or keeps responding the wrong way, something seriously wrong can happen. But even if voice commands work, having a PC close to where you cook is a bad idea, unless the TouchSmart PCs are oil-proof, water-proof, shock-proof, ding-proof, etc.</p>
<p>I'm sure HP's TouchSmart PCs can be used for a variety of tasks, but multitouch on a PC as of now is without a specific purpose. I personally like to keep my PC displays fingerprint-free. How would you like to be continuously cleaning your huge 23-inch LCD? Or even your 15.4-inch notebook LCD? By the way, that 20-inch or 23-inch display can be used as a monitor for your game consoles like the PlayStation or Xbox. Now that's a cool feature!</p>
