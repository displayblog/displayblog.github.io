<p><a href=http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/02/atandt-confirms-its-working-on-a-shared-data-plan-wont-commit/">Engadget</a>: AT&T CEO Ralph de la Vega shared that AT&T is working on a shared data plan during the D9 conference. AT&T currently has family plans that share minutes, sharing data sounds to me like a logical step. I'm surprised it's not here already.</p>
