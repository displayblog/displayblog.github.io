<p><strong>BIG BET ON LED:</strong> Vizio is planning to ship 3-4 million LCD TVs with LED backlights in 2010. The company is betting big on "LED TVs" in 2010 with shipments at around just 100,000 in 2009. According to William Wang, CEO of Vizio, LED-backlit LCD TVs will comprise less than 5% of the company's total LCD TV shipments in 2009 but that will increase to about 50% in Q4'10. LED-backlit LCD TV prices command a price premium of about US$100-200 than equivalent-sized CCFL-backlit LCD TVs. In three years that premium will decrease to $10 according to Wang.</p>
<p><strong>CES 2010:</strong> Vizio's plans include LCD TVs with edge-lit LED backlights, 3D TVs, IPTVs and LCD TVs with an ultrawide 21:9 aspect ratio at CES 2010. Taiwan-based Amtran Technology builds 70% of Vizio's LCD TVs and China-based TPV Technology builds the rest. Chimei Innolux is slated to be Vizio's third integrator.
