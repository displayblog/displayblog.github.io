<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/CES2010_Sony_Cybershot_TX7_Digital_Camera.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9060"  title="CES2010_Sony_Cybershot_TX7_Digital_Camera" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/CES2010_Sony_Cybershot_TX7_Digital_Camera.jpg" alt="" width="341" height="214" /></a>The TX7 from Sony sports a 10MP Exmor R CMOS image sensor that takes great low-light pictures (but not-so-great ones when there's a lot of light). Solid low-light shooting capability is a given for most prosumer digital cameras now, so that's not big news. This might be: Sony is touting the TX7 to be the first compact digital camera to record 1920 x 1080 video, in 60i as in interlaced, encoded in Advanced Video Codec High Definition (AVCHD).</p>
<p>Who cares about interlaced video? Thankfully you can also capture 1280 x 720 video at 30fps. Backlight Correction HDR is an interesting feature that takes two pictures at different settings and combines them into one. Need to take 10 photos in just a second? The TX7 can do that, but for just one second. Priced at US$399.99.</p>
<p>The HX5V is about the same as the TX7 (same 1080/60i video recording) but is a bit bigger and makes use of the higher-end Sony G lens. You can also GeoTag your photos with the HX5V ($349.99).
