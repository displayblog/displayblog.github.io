<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/10/3481678/apple-ipod-touch-review-2012">David Pierce, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The iPod touch&acirc;&euro;&trade;s display is exactly the same one as the iPhone 5 &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; a 4-inch, 1136 x 640 panel that looks fantastic. It's a much bigger upgrade for the touch, too, which used to have a washed out screen far worse than the iPhone &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; parity is a huge leap forward. More space is a good thing for almost every activity, but it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s most noticeable with movies and games, both of which take full advantage of the larger 16:9 screen. Movies and games are two of the most popular things to do on the iPod touch, I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m sure, so the screen is welcome.</blockquote></p>
<p>1136x640, on both the iPhone 5 and the iPod touch, is plain weird to me. If 16:9 and watching HD videos was Apple's focus why not add a few more pixels and get it up to 1280x720, a <em>universal</em> standard. Despite the non-standard pixel format at least the 4-inch in-cell touch IPS LCD looks fantastic.</p>
<p>The camera has been much improved and sports an iPhone 4-like 5 megapixel image sensor, but with an enhanced lens coupled with better software and processor. The result is a camera that's probably between the iPhone 4 and the iPhone 4S in terms of quality.</p>
<p>With WiFi available at home, the library, McDonald's, and a lot of other places the iPod touch with the right apps can function like a phone. Parents not wanting to spend more on extra data plans should take a close look at the new iPod touch, especially if the kids are absolutely set on the larger 4-inch display. The US$299 entry price seems high, but when you consider an additional $30 per month for data (I'm assuming 3 gigabytes is the absolute minimum for kids these days) the $100 premium over the iPhone 5 gets erased after just three and a half months.</p>
