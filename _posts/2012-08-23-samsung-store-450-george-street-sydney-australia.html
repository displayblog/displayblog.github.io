<blockquote><p>Everything from the store layout to the sales staff to the products and even the packaging and promotional material is uncannily Apple-esque.</blockquote></p>
<p>I don't see it. The tables are much smaller and are not made of thick solid wood. Samsung's blue shirt is a polo with the name tag pinned on; Apple's blue shirt doesn't have a collar and the name tag is not pinned on. The Samsung store is an entire block away from the Apple Store. There's <em>absolutely</em> no copying here folks.</p>
