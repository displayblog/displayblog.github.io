<p>Sony commissioned the HD Benchmark study to track &acirc;&euro;&oelig;how consumers are adopting these products and taking advantage of the benefits brought about by HD,&acirc;&euro; according to Carl Rose, Sony Australia&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Deputy Managing Director. According to the first HD Benchmark, 42% of total consumer electronics (CE) spending in the second quarter of 2006 was HD products including LCD TVs, plasma TVs, game consoles, set-top boxes (STBs), personal video recorders (PVRs), camcorders and DVD hardware. This was a significant increase from only 27% in the same quarter in 2005.</p>
<p>Hmmm. I didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t know DVD was considered HD. Did they mean Blu-Ray and HD-DVD? If that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the case, a few thousand units sound about right. Game consoles&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; there&acirc;&euro;&trade;s only one: Xbox 360. HD camcorders? There&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a few models by Sony and Canon. I would need a bit more clarification regarding the definition of &acirc;&euro;&oelig;HD products&acirc;&euro;. With scaling technology so advanced, anything type of device could &acirc;&euro;&oelig;accept&acirc;&euro; HD signals and then scaling it down to display it on &acirc;&euro;&oelig;HD Ready&acirc;&euro; screens. I wouldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t consider these bastardized CE devices as HD. Is an ED plasma TV considered part of &acirc;&euro;&oelig;HD products&acirc;&euro;? (The answer should be a definite &acirc;&euro;&oelig;No&acirc;&euro;.)</p>
