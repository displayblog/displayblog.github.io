  Not only is the S-Class of cars luxurious it is quite powerful and incoporates the
  latest and greatest technologies. One example would be the S65 AMG (picture above)
  that sports a 604hp 6.0L V12 engine. Torque? 738 lb-ft at 2000 - 4000 RPM. The V12
  will accelerate the 5964lb super sedan from 0-60MPH in just 4.2 seconds. Wow. Of
  course, you will pay for the privilege of having one of the most superb 4-door automobiles
  on the planet: MSRP US$198,950. And that doesn't include the destination and delivery
  charge of $875. Splitview LCD after the jump. "

<p>In about a year, Mercedes-Benz is planning to incorporate an interesting display technology. I was thinking of ways to describe this "Splitview LCD" but have a look at the image above. This is certainly a case when a picture was worth a thousand... (well maybe a hundred) words. Why do we need this technology? Because what one wants the other doesn't. The driver needs to concentrate on driving and there are laws that try to force that by requiring auto manufacturers to prevent DVD playback on the LCD while in drive. The government doesn't have to worry anymore. The driver can see GPS maps while the passenger can be watching anything he or she pleases. On the same LCD. Cool. I'm looking forward to getting my hands on a dual-din 7" <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=gps">GPS</a> unit with Splitview in 2010. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=pioneer">Pioneer</a>? <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sony">Sony</a>? <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=panasonic">Panasonic</a>? Please?</p>
