<p>High-temperature polysilicon (HTPS) TFT LCD panels are usually manufactured for LCD chips for rear projection implementations. The new thing about Seiko Epson's HTPS panels is that the company's hybrid driving technology is incorporated that enhances 3 LCD front projectors and rear projection TVs. The D6 series uses an inorganic alignment layer that has a diagonal size of 0.7" and has Full HD resolutions of 1920&nbsp;x 1080. The hybrid technology uses both internal and external drivers to drive the LCD. External driver ICs have superior driving capabilities compared to internal ones. The LCD driving controller IC is incorporated into the panel's connection tape that result in smoother images, less power consumption and space reduction that will lead to more compact designs. Seiko Epson's previous model, D5, has only a 1284 x 724 pixel resolution and is slightly smaller than the D6 at 1.8cm (versus Dy's 1.9cm). Because of the major jump in resolution, aperture was decreased from 59% to 43%, but contrast ratio enjoyed a big jump to 1500:1 from only 450:1 on the D5.</p><img alt="http://www.displayblog.com/pictures/displayblog/seiko_epson_htps_d6.jpg" src="http://www.displayblog.com/pictures/displayblog/seiko_epson_htps_d6.jpg">
