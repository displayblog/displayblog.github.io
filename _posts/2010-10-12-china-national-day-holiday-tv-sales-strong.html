<p>Primarily due to drastic price reductions. Flat-panel TV sales during China's National Day holidays in October are estimated to be around 5.5 to 6 million units with Sony, Sharp and Samsung brands getting all the attention. <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20101011PD210.html">Digitimes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The panel makers further pointed out that China-based vendors are actively promoting LED-backlit TVs, and some vendors have reduced the prices by 20% in October, narrowing the price gap between LED- and CCFL-backlit models to below 20%. For 32-inch LED-backlit models, prices are less than 3,000 yuan (US$449.7) in promotional sales, which is about 20% lower than the original prices. Some local vendors are also lowering the prices for CCFL-backlit models to gain market share. TCL's 32-inch CCFL-backlit model is only 2,399 yuan.</blockquote></p>
