<p><a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/144511/apples-corporate-imitators-are-borrowing-not-stealing/">Mike Elgan, Cult of Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When Steve Jobs <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW0DUg63lqU">famously quoted Picasso</a> by saying that &acirc;&euro;&oelig;good artists copy, great artists steal,&acirc;&euro;¬ù he meant that great artists (or companies) don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t look to be only superficially influenced by the greatness of others, but instead they take those great attributes in their totality and <em>make it their own</em>.</blockquote></p>
