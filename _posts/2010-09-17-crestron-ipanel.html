<blockquote><p>Multitasking and hard buttons. When it comes to using the iPad as a home controller, those are the two big missing pieces.</p>
<p>Now Crestron is tackling the issue of hard buttons with the new iPanel, which snaps over the face of an iPad like a clam shell.</blockquote></p>
<p>Can't disagree enough. Recommendation to Creston: Just focus on the iPanel app for the iPad. The iPad will probably become the biggest threat to your hardware controller businesses. Think AirPlay on the iPad with iOS 4.2. And then think about what might happen next year and the year after that.</p>
