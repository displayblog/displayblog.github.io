<p>Most projectors coming out these days these words associate with them: <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1080p">1080p</a>, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=full-hd">Full HD</a>, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a>, etc. These words connote that they will mostly be used to view high definition videos. ProjectionDesign's F30 DLP projector can do that too, but it isn't designed for it. The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1200">1920 x 1200</a> that the F30 has is more of a business-oriented pixel format than consumer. And with 1920 x 1200 pixels the F30 is able to project a huge display to show off your PowerPoint skills. Most desktop PCs and notebook PCs have a 16:10 aspect ratio, though that's about to change if Samsung gets its way.</p>

<p>You see, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/02/26/samsung-16-1080p-lcd-for-notebook-pcs/">Samsung wants everything to be 16:9</a> and that includes LCDs that go in notebook PCs, LCD monitors, and LCD TVs (we're already almost 100% with these). I'm not sure I want 1920 x 1080 on my notebook because that will mean 120 less vertical pixels. I like getting more for my hard-earned money. I'm sure you do too. And guess what? These new 16:9 LCD panels will probably earn Samsung a little premium over the "regular" wide panels.</p>
