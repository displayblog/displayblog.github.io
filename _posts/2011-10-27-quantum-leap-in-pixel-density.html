<p><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13924_3-20125504-64/ipad-3s-dense-display-a-challenge-for-manufacturers/">Brooke Crothers, CNET</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"They have production plans for 2,048x1,536 displays. Starting in November. But those are only plans at this point," said the source, referring to LG and Samsung.</p>
<p>"It's not a question of making just one. That, of course, can be done. The challenge is making lots of them," the source said. "This is a quantum leap in pixel density. This hasn't been done before."</blockquote></p>
<p>That's LG Display. And the "quantum leap in pixel density" is from 132 ppi to 264. The 9.7-inch IPS LCD used in the current iPads has a pixel format of 1024x768. Based on what Apple did with the iPhone 4 a Retina Display-equipped iPad would sport a pixel format of 2048x1536.</p>
