<p>The current iteration of the ASUS-built Nexus 7 sports a 7-inch 1280x800 IPS LCD. There is a rumor the next version of the Nexus 7 will increase the pixel count to 1920x1080. Casey Johnston, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/01/successor-to-googles-nexus-7-may-bump-to-1080p-display/">Ars Technica</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The next Nexus 7 may increase the resolution of its display to 1080p and maintain the relationship between Asus and Google, according to a <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20130128PD222.html">report from Digitimes</a>. The follow-up has been rumored for some time, but now Digitimes suggests Google will tweak the device with updates while maintaining the starting $199 price.</blockquote></p>
<p>The shift from 1280x800 to 1920x1080, if true, will require the external chassis design to change as well. The aspect ratio of 1280x800 is 16:10; the aspect ratio of 1920x1080 is 16:9. So the 1920x1080 Nexus 7 will be taller (in portrait mode) or wider (in landscape mode). This aspect ratio change will result in a more iPad mini-like tablet.</p>
<p>All smallish tablet designs will transition from bezels with uniform widths all around like the 9.7-inch iPads to one that has the longer bezels slimmed down like the 7.9-inch iPad mini. I don't think Apple does everything well, but there does seem to be a trend: Tablet manufacturers follow what Apple does when it comes to the overall look, feel, and experience of using a tablet. The thinner longer bezel on the iPad mini will be copied by everyone else making a 7.x-inch tablet. I don't know for sure, but I'm pretty sure.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, a 1920x1080 Nexus 7 for US$199 would be quite the bargain.</p>
