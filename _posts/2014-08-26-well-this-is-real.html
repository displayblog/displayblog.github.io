<p>Ellis Hamburger at <a href="http://www.theverge.com/a/virtual-reality/qa_fb">The Verge</a> has a Q&A about Oculus with Cory Ondrejka, creator of <em>Second Life</em> and VP of engineering at Facebook, and asks: &acirc;&euro;&oelig;What impressed you most about it?&acirc;&euro;¬ù</p>
<blockquote><p>First, visual performance. The difference between a slightly laggy experience or bad registration, or an experience with slightly malfunctioning optics, makes you half feel like you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re in VR and your brain has to adapt to it. With Oculus you didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have that. Instead, it was able to cross that threshold into presence where your brain is saying "Well, this is real," and that difference is fundamentally the difference between VR that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a promise and VR that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s actually here.</blockquote></p>
