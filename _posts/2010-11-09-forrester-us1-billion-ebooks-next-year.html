<p><a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/james_mcquivey/10-11-08-ebooks_ready_to_climb_past_1_billion">Forrester</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The punchline is this: 2010 will end with $966 million in eBooks sold to consumers. By 2015, the industry will have nearly tripled to almost $3 billion, a point at which the industry will be forever altered.</blockquote></p>
<p>That would mean there will be a lot of ebook readers out there. Millions. Billions?</p>
