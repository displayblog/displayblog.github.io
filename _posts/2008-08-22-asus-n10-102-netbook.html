<p><a href="http://www.blogeee.net/2008/08/22/exclu-asustek-n10-le-netbook-ultime/">blogeee.net</a> via <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/08/22/asus-n10-netbook-forgets-the-streets-ditches-eee-moniker/">Engadget</a>: The N10 from ASUS does not make use of the Eee brand. The Eee brand is synonymous with small and cheap, which isn't a bad thing unless you want to go upscale. And that's what ASUS seems to want to do with the N10. The N10 does come across as having a bit more style than your typical Eee PC, especially the glossy black (and thick!) bezel around the LCD.</p>
<p>And speaking of the LCD, the N10 netbook sports a 10.2" wide TFT LCD with a pixel format of 1024 x 600. It is reported on engadget to have a 1024 x 768 display, but that would make it a 4:3 aspect ratio and... well... 4:3 is disappearing quickly and is just simply not likely. Although ASUS tries hard to differentiate the N10 from its Eee-branded netbooks, but I just can't seem to separate ASUS from Eee PC, so anything that has ASUS on it seems a bit cheap feeling. Mathematically speaking: A=B, B=C, so A=C. (Hint: A in this case is Eee PC. B is ASUS. C is N10.)</p>
