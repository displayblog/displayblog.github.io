<p>Motorola CEO Sanjay Jha, <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.unwiredview.com/2011/08/11/motorolas-sanjay-jha-openly-admits-they-plan-to-collect-ip-royalties-from-other-android-makers/">Unwired View</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I would bring up IP as a very important for differentiation (among Android vendors). We have a very large IP portfolio, and I think in the long term, as things settle down, you will see a meaningful difference in positions of many different Android players. Both, in terms of avoidance of royalties, as well as potentially being able to collect royalties. And that will make a big difference to people who have very strong IP positions.</blockquote></p>
<p>Jha is suggesting two things. One, Motorola is in a very strong IP position. Two, in the long run Motorola will collect Android royalties.</p>
