<p>The Gateway FHD2303L is beautiful but it worries me. The transparent frame surrounding the 23-inch TFT LCD 1920x1080 panel looks nice, but the off-centered and troublingly thin stand may make you worry that it will break, tip over or both. Other specs include: 5ms response time, 250 cd/m2 brightness, VGA and DVI connections. Priced at US$249.99.</p>
