<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/28/blackberry-playbook-vs-ipad-vs-galaxy-tab-vs-streak-the-tale/">Engadget</a> has a nice table comparing the specs of four tablets: RIM's recently announced BlackBerry PlayBook, Apple's iPad, Samsung's Galaxy Tab, and Dell's Streak.</p>
<p>It's interesting to see how little RAM the iPad has compared to the other three: just 256MB, even less than the iPhone 4. The PlayBook packs in the most at 1GB while the other two doubles the iPad at 512MB. The absence of cameras on the iPad is also glaring.</p>
