<p>Andrew Cunningham, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/09/review-in-its-second-generation-the-moto-x-becomes-a-true-flagship/">Ars Technica</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It's got a big, sharp 5.2-inch 1080p AMOLED display, which is great for reading. Like all AMOLED displays, it has a tendency to oversaturate colors, and whites are often vaguely greenish, but as a tradeoff you get great contrast along with nice, deep blacks. The screen is bright enough to be usable in sunlight, though IPS panels like the one in the HTC One M8 are still a bit easier to see in these cases.</blockquote></p>
<p>Greenish whites and oversaturated colors are tradeoffs I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m not willing to take. Not all OLED displays are like the one in the Moto X; the OLED display in the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/03/31/samsung-galaxy-s5-review-by-raymond-soneira/">Samsung Galaxy S5</a> is almost perfect.</p>
<blockquote><p>The new camera brings two other noticeable improvements over the old one: it generally produces photos with more vibrant colors [...] and better fine detail [...]. Otherwise, though, it isn't especially exceptional, and its low-light performance is still mediocre at best (it may actually be a little worse than in the original, at least in our test shots). Among high-end smartphone cameras it is neither the worst nor the best.</blockquote></p>
<p>Motorola &mdash; no, Lenovo &mdash; should focus on improving the camera for the Moto X (2015).</p>
