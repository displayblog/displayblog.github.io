<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-3820 aligncenter" title="sony_vaio_p_completely_revealed" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/sony_vaio_p_completely_revealed.jpg" alt="sony_vaio_p_completely_revealed" width="500" height="398" /></p></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=vaio-p">VAIO P</a> from <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sony">Sony</a> is the company's entrant into the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=netbook">netbook</a> space. There are high expectations for the VAIO P. Engadget took it for a spin and found the keyboard to be "... a little bit light and shallow for our tastes, but good as far as most 'netbooks' go." The 'nipple' that you've seen before is very sensitive but can be calibrated to suit your tastes. The $900 price tag is a bit on the expensive side but there was a "standard amount of Sony build quality" according to Paul Miller at Engadget. The VAIO P was so lightweight that and seemed almost like a "mock-up device".</p>
<p>The VAIO P is billed as the world's lightest 8" netbook at just 1.4lbs. The battery is rated for four hours but with the optional high-capacity batter you can up that to 8 hours. GPS, WiFi N, 3G and Bluetooth are all there. Instant-on mode? Yes and gets you straight to Sony's Xross Media Bar. The VAIO P will be available in February 2009 in four colors: garnet red, emerald green, onyx black and crystal white. I'll take the black one.</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/01/07/vaio-p-hands-on/">more pictures at the Engadget post</a>&Acirc;&nbsp;as well as a couple of videos.</p>
