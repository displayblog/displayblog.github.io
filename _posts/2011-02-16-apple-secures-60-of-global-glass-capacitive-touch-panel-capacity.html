<p>According to component suppliers and reported by <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20110216PD219.html">DigiTimes</a>, Apple has cornered 60% of global glass capacitive touch panel capacity resulting in a tight supply situation for competitors like HP, Motorola, and RIM. I don't know the specifics but it wouldn't be surprising if Apple is using its huge cash reserves to secure these touch panels ahead of new product announcements.</p>
<p>Apple just started selling its CDMA iPhone 4 on Verizon Wireless and will most likely announce the next-generation iPad 2 soon (and the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/02/10/ipad-3/">iPad 3</a>) and another updated iPhone (read <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/02/09/wait-for-the-next-iphone-iphone-4s/"><em>Wait For The Next iPhone: iPhone 4S</em></a>) in June or July. Both the iPhone and iPad require glass-based capacitive touch panels. Yields for touch panels were a problem in 2010, but by securing roughly 60% of global capacity Apple is maximizing its chances to meet what will be enormous demand for its new iPhones and iPads in 2011.</p>
