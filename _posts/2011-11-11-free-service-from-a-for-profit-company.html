<blockquote><p>Bottom-line: I know from experience that it's bad to depend on a for-profit company to give me a free service that is supposed to not feel like it's free.</blockquote></p>
<p>I've been Facebook-free for months and the only thing that has changed is now I have more time. For my family and for stuff I really want to do.</p>
