<p><a href="http://www.leica-camera.com/Photography/T-System/Leica-T/Details">Leica</a>: The Leica T is a 16.5 megapixel APS-C interchangeable lens camera milled from a solid block of aluminum, which then is hand polished for 45 minutes. With a 3.7-inch 854x480 16:9 touch LCD, an iOS app that can act as a remote electronic viewfinder and shutter, the T is Leica's entrance into the modern world of cameras. The Leica T will be available on May 26, 2014. If you are serious about acquiring a Leica price should not be a concern.</p>
