<p><strong>Touch?</strong> According to Ryan, touch will eventually happen. The challenge is to overcome the negative impact of a touch layer on optical properties in reflective mode. Thankfully there are touch sensors that do not require an additional layer that reduces the front screen performance of many displays.</p>
<p><strong>Versus Kindle</strong> The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=kindle&amp;sa=Search#1345">Kindle</a> has a whiter white than the q3i. Ryan also admitted that the Kindle draws less power. But the 3qi beats the Kindle in very important metric: fast refresh. Without fast refreshes you can't do video or even scrolling text. If you wanted to implement touch, fast refresh is an absolute requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Bigger 3qi?</strong> Pixel Qi is concentrating on manufacturing 3qi displays that offer the most value and that seems to be for portable devices that would benefit from a display that consumes very little power but still offer very good display performance. I would like to recommend that Pixel Qi look at displays used for digital signage where most of the time the display is fighting against a lot of ambient light by consuming an enormous amount of power and requiring more to cool them down.</p>
