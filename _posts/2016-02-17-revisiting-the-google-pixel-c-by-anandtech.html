<p>[ <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/9996/revisiting-the-google-pixel-c">AnandTech</a> ] Brandon Chester:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the end, Google's fixes to the Pixel C's software have done a lot to address the issues I noted in the original review. Its gone from being a tablet that I could not possibly recommend to anyone, to potentially being the best Android tablet you can buy. Unfortunately that's not a high bar to clear, but it's still a great improvement over the Pixel C with its original firmware. I still think I would forgo the keyboard, as Android just doesn't work well with it, and there aren't nearly enough tablet-focused applications to use it with to justify the additional cost.</blockquote></p>
<p>For that kind of money I'd get a Samsung Galaxy Note 4: a large-enough smartphone that can act like a small tablet.</p>
