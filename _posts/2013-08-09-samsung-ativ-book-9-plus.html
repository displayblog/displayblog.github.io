<p><a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130809005379/en/Samsung-Announces-U.S.-Launch-ATIV-Book-9">BusinessWire</a>: What a terrible name. The main feature of Samsung's new Windows 8 notebook is the 13.3-inch touch LCD with a 3200x1800 pixel format. Is the integrated HD Graphics 4400 GPU powerful enough to smoothly push all 5.76 million pixels? I have my doubts. Priced at US$1400.</p>
