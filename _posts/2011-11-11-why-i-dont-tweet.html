<blockquote><p>Judge Liam O&acirc;&euro;&trade;Grady ruled Thursday that the associates had no reasonable expectation of privacy when they used Twitter services, even if the information in question was known only to Twitter and not publicly disclosed. The government is seeking data from their accounts including their devices&acirc;&euro;&trade; Internet protocol (IP) addresses, which can reveal information about location, and data on people with whom they communicated.</blockquote></p>
