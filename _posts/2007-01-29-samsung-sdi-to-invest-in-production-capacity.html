<p>Samsung SDI, a South Korean plasma display panel (PDP) manufacturer, will invest 710 billion won (about US$758 million) to increase production capacity in 2007. The production capacity will be used for PDPs as well as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). This is response to Matsushita, who took over the #1 position from Samsung SDI in 2006. The new PDP plant was originally slated to begin operations in May 2007 but I do not have update information regarding the schedule. The new PDP plant is most likely to have a production capacity of 250,000 42" equivalent PDPs per month increasing SDI's annual production capacity to 7.3 million units in 2007.</p>
