<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303754904577532121136436182.html">Juro Osawa and Lorraine Luk, The Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Japanese liquid-crystal-display makers Sharp Corp. and Japan Display Inc.&mdash;a new company that combined three Japanese electronics makers' display units&mdash;as well as South Korea's LG Display Co. are currently mass producing panels for the next iPhone using so-called in-cell technology, the people said.</p>
<p>The technology integrates touch sensors into the LCD, making it unnecessary to have a separate touch-screen layer. The absence of the layer, usually about half-a-millimeter thick, not only makes the whole screen thinner, but improves the quality of displayed images [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>Getting rid of the extra touch layer on top of the LCD improves the visual experience: The content is clearer and closer to you. The effect should be similar to what you experience with the retina MacBook Pro where the cover glass has been eliminated.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I doubt the next iPhone (5) will sport a cover glass-less design. Unlike the retina MacBook Pro the iPhone is portable and the display is touched, pressed, and banged on, which demand a durable solution. There is the possibility of Corning developing a special version of the Gorilla glass that can be used to manufacture color filters.</p>
<p>The other benefit is interactional: Instead of touching a layer on top of the content, you're now touching the content itself. The benefits of in-cell touch is clear, but as with any advancement in technology there will be hurdles: Touch circuitry will need to be integrated into the TFT and that may result in a hit on yields, at first.</p>
