<blockquote>Consumer sampling at several consumer electronics retail locations by CEA and ChannelForce found nearly 40 percent of consumers believed traffic this year was heavier than last Black Friday and nearly 80 percent believed it was at least as busy, if not more so, than last year.</blockquote><br />
Consumers were asked about their thoughts on store traffic compared to last year? This type of market research is unreliable. First, CEA and ChannelForce most likely did not check to see if the consumer came to the same store last year. Second, even if the consumer did, trying to remember store traffic from a year ago would be far from accurate.
