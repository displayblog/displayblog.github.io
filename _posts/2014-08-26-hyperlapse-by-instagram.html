<p><a href="http://blog.instagram.com/post/95829278497/hyperlapse-from-instagram">Instagram Blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Traditionally, time lapse videos depend on holding your phone or camera still while you film. Hyperlapse from Instagram features built-in stabilization technology that lets you create moving, handheld time lapses that result in a cinematic look, quality and feel&mdash;a feat that has previously only been possible with expensive equipment.</blockquote></p>
<p>Cool.</p>
