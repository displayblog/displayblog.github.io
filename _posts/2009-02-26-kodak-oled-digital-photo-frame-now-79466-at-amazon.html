<p>Kodak's OLED digital photo frame is probably the most expensive digital photo frame in the world. I've seen it and the display quality on the OLED is really <em>really</em> nice. It is by far the best digital photo frame in terms of image quality. But the price is quite high. Kodak introduced it with a $999 price. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/01/12/ces-2009-kodak-oled-digital-photo-frame/">Then during CES 2009 the price was reduced to $858.99</a> (Amazon price). Thanks to OLED-Info, I was just notified that the price has dropped even more. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HBHSMO?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=displ0f-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B001HBHSMO">A quick check on Amazon.com shows a price of just US$794.66</a>. The price is lower but the Kodak OLED digital photo frame still takes the crown as the world's most expensive digital photo frame. By far. Can we see $499 soon in the future?</p>
