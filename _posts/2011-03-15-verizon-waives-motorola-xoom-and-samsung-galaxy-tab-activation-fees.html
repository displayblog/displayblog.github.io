<blockquote><p>Verizon Wireless has informed us via email that it will be waiving the $35 activation fees for the Motorola XOOM and Samsung Galaxy Tab Android-powered tablets. The Apple iPad does not have an activation fee associated with it.</blockquote></p>
<p>Check your Verizon bill thoroughly. When you get your bill <em>with</em> the activation fee you'll need the patience and fortitude to go to a Verizon store or call the customer service center to get it off. Make sure you set aside a good chunk of your time because it'll take a while.</p>
<p>Although this was many years ago, the reason we switched from Verizon to AT&T was from pure exhaustion: exhaustion from our monthly ritual of wasting an hour of our time with a Verizon representative getting rid of ridiculous charges from our cellular bill. After six or so months we called it quits. Even Verizon realized their extreme incompetence and waived our ETFs.</p>
