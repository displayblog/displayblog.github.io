<blockquote><p>If you don't have a television, this makes it better for watching standard 16:9 HD-aspect ratio movies than the original iPad, with its 1024x768 (4:3) screen.</blockquote></p>
<p>The best HDTV, if you don't have a TV. Harsh. There has been a lot of negative press regarding the Motorola Xoom, so checked out what actually customers were saying on Amazon.</p>
<p>As of this writing there are 235 customer views: 142 (60%) were 5 stars, 50 (21%) were 4 stars, 18 (7.7%) were 3 stars, 18 were 2 stars, and just 7 (3%) gave the Motorola Xoom a single star.</p>
<p>Here are some things customers liked about the Motorola Xoom:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tabbed browsing with the included Chrome browser.</li>
<li>Drag and drop e-books, photographs, videos.</li>
<li>Stereo speakers.</li>
<li>Adobe Flash.</li>
<li>Seamless syncing with Google services like Gmail.</li>
<li>16:9 HD video playback.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>So what's not to like?</p>
<ul>
<li>Lagging, freezing, crash-prone browser.</li>
<li>Dead pixels.</li>
<li>Difficulty connecting to WiFi networks.</li>
<li>Camera app slow to load.</li>
<li>Sluggish operating system.</li>
<li>Flash does not work out of the box.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>One comment: Flash is polarizing. I only run Flash when I have to on my MacBook Pro by loading Google's Chrome browser. When Flash is running my MBP heats up and overall responsiveness on websites slows down considerably.</p>
<p>Motorola might have to get more strict on its dead pixel policy from its LCD suppliers because those pixels would ruin the otherwise nice experience of watching 16:9 HD videos. If you'd like to purchase the WiFi-only Motorola Xoom consider using this link: $588.99 at Amazon.</p>
