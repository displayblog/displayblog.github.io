<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/08/29/reminder-quad-hd-doesnt-make-everything-look-better/">Engadget</a>: The massive 150" plasma TV from Panasonic is a go. As soon as Panasonic's plasma display panel (PDP) fabrication plant commences production in May 2009, the 150" PDP will be on its way to stores so you can plunk down an unheard amount of money for it. But what will you do with it?</p>
<p>You will most likely not have any 4K2K video sources. And even if you did, you'll need to play it somehow. You might have managed to secure a yet-to-be-available JVC 4K2K super high-definition player to pump the 4K2K video via dual-link DVI to the massive 150" plasma, but I doubt it. What I'm getting at is that there is little infrastructure to support 4K2K as of now, in terms of viewing 4K2K video that is. Getting a computing environment on a 4K2K-capable display, on the other hand, would be easy since dual-link DVI is fairly easy to find.</p>
<p>But the day will come when you'll be able to get 4K2K disks via Netflix or at Blockbuster (if they're around by then). Many versions later, both the PlayStation and Xbox gaming consoles will probably have 4K2K-ROM read capability. Just imagine what games will look like on 4K2K! You'll need to get a doctor to give you a clean bill of health so your heart can take what will seem to be happening for real. Other changes will happen. What will be interesting are the changes that will undergo in terms of movie-making. Even now with the transition from 480i to 720p/1080i the actors and actress must have perfect faces. If you have a tiny pimple somewhere, viewers will notice. Got a single nose hair that's protruding beyond the confines of the nose by just 1mm? Well, gotta get rid of that before you get in front of the 1080/24p video camcorder. Or else people will notice. Now, can you imagine how much more perfection will be demanded by the time video is shot at 4K2K? Maybe we'll see virtual characters that look and act so human, we won't be able to tell the difference.</p>
