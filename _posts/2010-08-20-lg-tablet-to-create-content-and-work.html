<p>Chang Ma, Vice President of Marketing at LG Electronics, in an interview with <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704476104575439394082294812.html?mod=WSJ_Tech_LEFTTopNews">The Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The first LG tablet, which will run on Google Inc.&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Android software, will set itself apart from Apple Inc.&acirc;&euro;&trade;s iPad by focusing on the ability to create content, rather than simply display it. ... Our tablet will be better than the iPad. ... It's going to be surprisingly productive.<br />
</blockquote></p>
