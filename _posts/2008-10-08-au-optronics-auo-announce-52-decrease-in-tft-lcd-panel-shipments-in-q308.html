<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=au-optronics">AU Optronics</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=auo">AUO</a>), the largest <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-manufacturer">LCD manufacturer</a> in Taiwan, announced September and Q3'08 shipment results and they are not very good. Due to "uncertainties of the current macro environment" the top Taiwan LCD supplier saw both revenues and unit shipments decrease in September and Q3'08. This is not a good sign as Q3'08 should see increases across the board as the entire LCD industry gears up for a strong Q4'08 season.</p>
<p><strong>L/A TFT LCD Panel Shipments</strong><br />
September: Down&Acirc;&nbsp; 3.3% M/M, x.x% Y/Y, 7 million<br />
Q3&acirc;&euro;&sup2;08: Down 5.2% Q/Q, down 6.9% Y/Y, 20.7 million</p>
<p><strong>L/A TFT LCD Panel Revenues</strong> (Unaudited Consolidated)<br />
September: Down 6.8% M/M, down 35.7% Y/Y, NT$34.563 billion<br />
Q3&acirc;&euro;&sup2;08: Down 15.5% Q/Q, down 24.4% Y/Y, NT$104.314 billion</p>
<p>AUO explained that shipments as well as ASPs were lower than expected for IT panels. TV panels also exhibited weak ASPs but met previous guidance in terms of unit shipments. I would be very interested in the size breakout of the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a> panel shipments. My guess is that <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=32"">32"</a> were strong as well as 46". My reasoning is that 32" LCD TV set prices hit $499 and will be the size to get for a middle-income home in the US. The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=46"">46" LCD TV</a> set prices tumbled to below $999 and would generate considerable demand from those who have a bit more money.</p>
