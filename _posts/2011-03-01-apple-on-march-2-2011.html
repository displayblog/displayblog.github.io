<p>I am certain some of you purchased an iPhone 4 today. According to an Apple Store employee in Lexington, KY you should have waited until tomorrow. You would have been glad you did. <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/reader-i-tried-to-buy-iphone-today-apple-said-wait-until-tomorrow/84348">Cult of Mac</a> reader Lovell:</p>
<blockquote><p>I had a friend go to apple today to purchase an iPhone 4. The salesmen talked her out of buying it and told her to come back tomorrow. Would not say what was coming out tomorrow but said she would be verry happy. I ask what it could be phone wise because she said I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t want a white iPhone but yet the salesmen still wouldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t say.</blockquote></p>
<p>This is a head-scratcher because as far as I can tell tomorrow is all about the next-generation iPad, which I'll call iPad 2. <a href="http://www.yourdailyapple.net/2011/03/ipad-2-surfaced-in-amazon-store-thunderbolt-camera-and-1-2ghz-cpu/">Your Daily Apple</a> is reporting that the iPad 2 is/was available on Amazon's German store spec'ed with a Thunderbolt connection. I understand that <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/02/23/thunderbolt-high-speed-io/">Thunderbolt will become standard on all things from Apple</a>. But the iPad? So soon? We won't have to wait too long to find out.</p>
<p>What <em>can</em> we expect from the iPad 2? It will be lighter, thinner, and sport cameras. There is much talk about a completely revamped MobileMe but it better be rock solid in light of Google losing some Gmail users emails. There will always be that chance but let's hope Apple gets it right.</p>
<p>An <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/02/10/ipad-3/">iPad 3</a>? Here's something interesting from another Apple employee <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/apple-staffer-ipad-3-is-the-one-to-make-a-song-dance-about/84275">Cult of Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the iPad 2 don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t get your hopes up too high. That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s all I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m going to say. They&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve had a number of problems along the way, and the third-generation iPad is the one to make a song and a dance about.</blockquote></p>
<p>I'm expecting <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/02/17/september-2011-will-be-the-spectacular-month-for-apple/">Apple to unveil another iPad, the iPad 3, in September</a> sporting a Retina Display: a 9.7-inch IPS TFT LCD with a 2048x1536 pixel format. Once I get a hold of one I'm pretty sure I'll "make a song and a dance." Regardless of what happens in September, March 2, 2011 I reckon will be pretty exciting.</p>
