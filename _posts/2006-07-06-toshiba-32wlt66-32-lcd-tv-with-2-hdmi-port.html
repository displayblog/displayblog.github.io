<p>The Toshiba unit, in addition to having two HDMI ports, has both an analog (NTSC) and digital (ATSC) tuner. The two HDMI ports gives the user the flexibility of having two HDMI video sources such as a Xbox 360/PS3 and a HD-DVD/Blu-Ray box. The enclosure has a glossy piano black finish. Additional ports include VGA and DVI to hook up your PC. Toshiba also dropped 37", 42" and 47" versions. The unit has a 1366 x 768 resolution, 1200:1 contrast ratio, and 500 nits of brightness.
