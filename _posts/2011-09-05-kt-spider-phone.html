<p><a href="http://www.androidpit.com/en/android/blog/397606/IFA-Video-KT-Spider-Concept-Combines-Smartphone-Tablet-and-Laptop-Into-One">AndroidPIT</a>: The KT Spider Phone takes the original concept pioneered by the Motorola Atria many steps further. The Spider Phone can be docked into a notebook, a 10.1-inch tablet, and a gamepad. All three peripherals come with batteries, but the processing is solely done by the Gingerbread smartphone.</p>
<p>Keyboards, mice, and other USB peripherals can be connected to the micro USB port. And using the micro HDMI port the Spider Phone can be connected to a TV.</p>
<p>What might be the most intriguing feature is the 4.5-inch display: it packs a pixel format of 1280x800. A world's first if I'm not mistaken. The KT Spider Phone will be launched in South Korea in November or December. Pricing has not been determined.</p>
