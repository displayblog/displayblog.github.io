<p><a href="http://dcurt.is/dell-s-predicament">Dustin Curtis</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>While productive corporate employees might not give up PCs, the vast majority of other workers will. That is not industry growth; that is transition and consolidation. When thinking in the long term, Dell's PC group can be basically ignored. It's the end of an era, and it puts the company in a terrifying predicament. There is now no clear end game for Dell, and the company's core competencies are being rendered irrelevant by evolution.</blockquote></p>
