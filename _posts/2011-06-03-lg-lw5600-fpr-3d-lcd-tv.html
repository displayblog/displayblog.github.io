<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/03/lg-lw5600-3d-lcd-hdtv-review/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>While the future of 3D is still uncertain, the potential of FPR-based displays is that users can buy a TV and share in cheap passive glasses to be tossed around and shared among friends but the technology does limit the resolution viewable per eye. After watching Blu-ray 3D movies, broadcast 3D TV shows and sporting events, and playing videogames in 3D and have come away with the opinion that it depends on the conditions. In general, high quality sources like Blu-ray 3D movies take the least hit compared to active shutter 3DTVs, since they're in 1080p the reduction in resolution isn't particularly noticeable, and after a recent firmware update changed the algorithm for video processing it improved some minor artifacts we'd seen at CES. Sitting up close revealed the aliasing caused by missing pixels, particularly on elements popped up to appear in front of the screen, like the ESPN 3D score bug in the corner and if you're close enough, there can appear to be lines in the picture.</blockquote></p>
<p>Two things. Most of us, who have two eyes, watch TV with both eyes. The 3D effect is only there because we have two eyes. What is the use of mentioning what the resolution is to just one eye when almost no one watches TV that way? Instead of getting picky over specifications, which I am also guilty of doing, let's focus on the experience. Film Patterned Retarder or FPR, in my opinion, is much more comfortable than active shutter and to my eyes I experience 1080p 3D content in 1080p 3D with FPR.</p>
<p>The second objection is similar to the first. As a parent I'm sensitive to how close my children get to the TV. There is an optimum distance: for kids, the farther you are the better! I'm only half joking there, but why would you sit up close? To get a good look at the pixels? Relax, sit back, at the recommended distance, and then let me know what that experience is like.</p>
<p>I'm no fan of 3D since my eyes work well enough with my brain to bring about the desired 3D effect in 2D video content, but if you absolutely must get a 3D TV I highly recommend going for one that has FPR technology.</p>
