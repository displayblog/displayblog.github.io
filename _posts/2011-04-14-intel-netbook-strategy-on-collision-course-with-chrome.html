<blockquote><p>Intel has recently adjusted its netbook strategy and is set to cooperate with its partners including Asustek Computer and Acer to launch netbook devices priced below US$199 in regions such as the Middle-East, Latin America and Eastern Europe, according to sources from notebook players.</blockquote></p>
<p>Meego it seems will be the OS of choice for these ultra-cheap netbooks, which brings to mind Google's Chrome, an OS targeted at ultra-cheap netbooks, and now tablets. My bet is on Googling: KO in round one, assuming Google continues to keep completely open Chrome OS.</p>
