<p><a href="http://releasecandidateone.com/241:my_month_with_the_nexus_s">Chris Clark</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I want a phoneputer that just works and lets me pursue my own goals; goals that don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t include being a sysadmin. The Nexus S does everything one could reasonably expect of a smartphone, and it does them competently, but if you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve experienced a smartphone that does those things <em>exceptionally</em>, mere competence is a big step backward.</blockquote></p>
