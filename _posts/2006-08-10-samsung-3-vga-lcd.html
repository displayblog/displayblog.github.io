<p>On August 10, that would be today, Samsung introduced the world's first 3" TFT LCD panel with a resolution of 640 x 480 pixels. The title <a href="http://www.samsung.com/PressCenter/PressRelease/PressRelease.asp?seq=20060810_0000279279#">press release by Samsung</a> states that this panel is intended for digital still cameras, but I think there would be many more uses for this 3" high-resolution display. So Mr. Yun Jin-Hyuk, EVP, and I are in agreement when he said: "Our new LCD panel will make viewing... more impressive on camera screens, personal multimedia players and other products..."</p>
<p>This 3" VGA LCD operates at 30Hz, about half that of a normal LCD that typically runs at 60Hz. Of course there are new LCD TV panels that run at 120Hz as part of a group of technologies to reduce motion blur. Back to the 30Hz... this allows VGA images to be captured by digital cameras without having to create another interface and continue using the ITU-R601 interface. The ITU-R601 is a video interface that was established by the International Telecommunications Union and has been applied to digital cameras.</p>

<p>A dot inversion scheme (if you want technical information about dot inversion, click <a href="http://tftlcd.kyunghee.ac.kr/research/lcd_sim/">here</a>) is used to lower power consumption and to reduce image flickering. The 30Hz source driver ICs require less power than the typical 60Hz drivers leading to more usage times. BTW, I have to charge my Motorola RAZR every single day and I don't even use it that much during the day. Only of the RAZR had this 3" VGA TFT LCD! I can dream...<a href="http://imid.k-ids.or.kr/home/eng/Program/default.asp?globalmenu=5&amp;localmenu=13"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://imid.k-ids.or.kr/home/eng/Program/default.asp?globalmenu=5&amp;localmenu=13">International Meeting on Information Display (IMID)</a> will be held in Daegu, South Korea from August 22 to 25 and Samsung will be exhibiting this high-resolution marvel there. Samsung is planning to mass produce this panel in the first half of 2007.</p>
<p>Here are the specifications:</p>
