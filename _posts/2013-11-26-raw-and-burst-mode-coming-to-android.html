<blockquote><p><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57612766-94/source-code-snippets-open-door-for-raw-photos-on-android/">Evidence of raw and burst-mode photos in the Android source code</a> surfaced earlier in November, but Google has now commented on the technology. Specifically, spokeswoman Gina Scigliano said the support is now present in Android's hardware abstraction layer (HAL), the part of the operating system that handles communications with a mobile device's actual hardware.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Android's latest camera HAL (hardware abstraction layer) and framework supports raw and burst-mode photography,&acirc;&euro; Scigliano said. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;We will expose a developer API [application programming interface] in a future release to expose more of the HAL functionality.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>RAW would be nice. Burst mode too, but if you can't wait there are <a href="http://howto.cnet.com/8301-11310_39-57604876-285/those-cool-ios-7-features-android-does-that-too/">apps like Fast Burst Camera Lite that let you take 30 shots per second on newer higher-end Android smartphones</a>. Of course burst mode support on the default camera app would be best. Yesterday night I was hanging out with my friend James Lee and he showed me a funny video on his Samsung Galaxy Note 2, in slow motion. Now the entire video clip was in slow motion, and I don't know if the Note 2 can do what the iPhone 5s does with slow motion video, but slow motion does exist on Android. It would be great if all modern Android smartphones had RAW, burst mode, and slow motion out of the box.</p>
