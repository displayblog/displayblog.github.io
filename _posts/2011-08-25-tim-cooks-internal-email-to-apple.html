<p>Tim Cook assures Apple will remain the same, <em>via</em> <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/08/tim-cook-e-mail-to-apple-employees-apple-is-not-going-to-change.ars">Ars Technica</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Team:</p>
<p>I am looking forward to the amazing opportunity of serving as CEO of the most innovative company in the world. Joining Apple was the best decision I've ever made and it's been the privilege of a lifetime to work for Apple and Steve for over 13 years. I share Steve's optimism for Apple's bright future.</p>
<p>Steve has been an incredible leader and mentor to me, as well as to the entire executive team and our amazing employees. We are really looking forward to Steve's ongoing guidance and inspiration as our Chairman.</p>
<p>I want you to be confident that Apple is not going to change. I cherish and celebrate Apple's unique principles and values. Steve built a company and culture that is unlike any other in the world and we are going to stay true to that&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it is in our DNA. We are going to continue to make the best products in the world that delight our customers and make our employees incredibly proud of what they do.</p>
<p>I love Apple and I am looking forward to diving into my new role. All of the incredible support from the Board, the executive team and many of you has been inspiring. I am confident our best years lie ahead of us and that together we will continue to make Apple the magical place that it is.</p>
<p>Tim</blockquote></p>
<p>If Steve Jobs has successful transferred himself into the culture of Apple, with his executives reinforcing his beliefs and vision, then we should expect Apple to remain the same for the time being.</p>
