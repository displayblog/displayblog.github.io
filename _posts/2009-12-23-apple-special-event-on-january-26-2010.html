<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/12/23/apple-tablet-in-january/">Guess I was wrong about the timing</a>. I thought it was going to be sooner, before CES. According to the Financial Times, Apple has rented the stage for several days at the end of January starting on the 26th at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco. There are a lot of rumors as to what products will be unveiled; I guess we will have to wait and see.
