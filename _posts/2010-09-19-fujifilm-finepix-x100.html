<p><a href="http://finepix.com/x100/en/top.html">Fujifilm FinePix X100 Microsite</a>, <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/1009/10091910fujifilmx100.asp">DPReview</a>: The FinePix X100 from Fujifilm packs a 12-megapixel APS-C image sensor into a rangefinder-looking compact body. The 23mm Fujinon aspherical lens is fast at f/2 and the 2.8-inch LCD sports a remarkably dense 800x600 pixels. That's 357 PPI, besting even the iPhone 4's Retina Display (<em>only</em> 326 PPI). Burst mode gets you 5fps.</p>

<p>Fujifilm states that the image sensor is 10x that of conventional compact digital cameras with an ISO range of 200 to 6400. I'm guessing low-light photographs will turn out quite well, but we'll have to see for actual results.</p>
<p>I do have one concern and that's video. The X100 will do 720p video. The Olympus E-P1, E-P2, and E-PL1 all do 720/30p, but these guys have been around a bit already. Panasonic's GF1 does 720/30p too. All the Micro Four Thirds rangefinder-like cameras are limited to 720/30p. The NEX-5 and NEX-3 from Sony are probably the closest to the FinePix X100 as both pack an APS-C-sized image sensor. The NEX-3 is limited to 720/30p, but I would have thought 1080/60i would have been a must-have feature considering the 1080/60i video capture capability of the NEX-5.</p>

<p>The hybrid viewfinder is unique. It combines an optical viewfinder and an electronic viewfinder. A prism is integrated for the image on the LCD and allows for both the shooting frame and data to be displayed. Shoot old-school or shoot with the LCD: you can instantly switch between the two viewfinders.</p>
<p>The best part about the FinePix X100 is that all this technology is crafted into a beautiful magnesium alloy rangefinder-like body. Even the dials are made of metal. Just lovely.</p>
