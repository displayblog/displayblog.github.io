<p>If money grew in your backyard, pay attention to this 3D monitor: the BT-3DL2550 from Panasonic is a 25.5-inch IPS (In-Plane Switching) TFT LCD monitor that does 3D. The pixel format is 1920x1200 (16:10 aspect ratio) and works its 3D magic via a Xpol polarizing filter so you'll be wearing some passive polarizing glasses. Connectivity options include two HD-SDI ports, a single DVI-D, component and composite. The HD-SDI ports are used to directly connect to Panasonic's Full HD 3D camcorder. Six color settings are included: SMPTE, EBU, ITU-R BT.709, Adobe 2.2, Adobe 1.8, D-Cinema. I believe this is a first: A three dimensional lookup table for calibration. And finally the insane price: $9900. The BT-3DL2550 has been added to the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/databases/ips-lcd-monitors/">IPS LCD Monitors</a> database.
