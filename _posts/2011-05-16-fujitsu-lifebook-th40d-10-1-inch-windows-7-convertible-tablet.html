<p><a href="http://pr.fujitsu.com/jp/news/2011/05/13.html?nw=pr">Fujitsu</a>: The Fujitsu LifeBook TH40/D is a 10.1-inch Windows 7 convertible tablet. The 10.1-inch LCD sports a 1024x600 pixel format. Priced at &Acirc;&yen;80,000 (about $990) with availability in Japan at the end of June.</p>
<p>The hardware industrial design looks to be excellent incorporating flexibility to be used as a typical iPad-like tablet but also like a netbook. Unfortunately the choice of Windows 7 will likely make the TH40/D less than snappy with time and resources required to keep the convertible up-and-running. Unfortunately there is only one other option, which is Google's Android (Honeycomb). I think Microsoft is missing an opportunity by not aggressively porting Windows Phone 7 (WP7) and building Windows Tablet 7 (WT7).</p>
<p>Excellent hardware ID aside, the choice of the 7-inch with only 1024x600 pixels make for a less than tempting proposition. My suggestion would be to reduce the bezels, especially on the side that has the keyboard lip, use a slightly larger display and pack a lot more pixels.</p>
