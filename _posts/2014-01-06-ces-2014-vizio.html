<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/6/5279150/vizio-announces-first-consumer-4k-tvs-kills-3d-support">The Verge</a>: Vizio showcased its consumer-focused P Series 4K Ultra HD LCD TV with 64 active LED zones for local dimming. The P Series will be priced aggressively. On the other hand the Reference Series is Vizio's high-end 4K TVs sporting HDR and targeting videophiles and custom integrators: 800 nits, Dolby Vision, and true-to-life contrast. Both series sport HVEC codec for streaming, 4K playback at 60fps, but no 3D. Good riddance.</p>

<blockquote><p>[...] its consumer-grade P series lineup of 4K TVs will start at only $999.99 for a 50-inch model. The top-end, 70-inch model will go for $2,599.99 [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>Vizio wasn't kidding when the company said the P series would be priced aggressively.</p>
