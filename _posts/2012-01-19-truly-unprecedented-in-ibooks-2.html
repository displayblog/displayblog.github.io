<blockquote><p>The real story here today shouldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be that Apple has &acirc;&euro;&tilde;audaciously&acirc;&euro;&trade; claimed ownership of the books make with iBooks Author but that they have created an avenue for <em>non-commercial distribution</em> that would exclude them <strong>entirely</strong>. That is actually unprecedented.</blockquote></p>
