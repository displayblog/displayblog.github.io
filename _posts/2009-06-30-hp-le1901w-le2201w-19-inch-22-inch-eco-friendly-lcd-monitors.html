<p>The HP LE2201w 22-inch LCD monitor is pictured above. Nothing much to look at, but I like it that way: simple. There is also the 19-inch version: LE1901w. Both of these monitors are billed as "Eco-Friendly" by HP. But, before I get into the merits of how eco-friendly these monitors really are, let's look at some basic specifications for the 22-incher:</p></p>
<p>LE2201w Technical Specifications</p></p>
<ul>
<li>Size/Display Technology: 22-inch TN TFT LCD</li>
<li>Resolution: 1680x1050</li>
<li>Contrast Ratio: 1000:1</li>
<li>Response Time: 5ms</li>
<li>Viewing Angles: 160/160</li>
<li>Brightness: 250 cd/m2</li>
<li>Connections: VGA (15-pin D-sub)</li>
<li>Mount: VESA 100mm x 100mm</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Now, let's find out why these are called eco-friendly. First, these monitors consume less power. How? The optical film stack was improved to increase light transmittance. In other words, more light from the backlight can get through to you. There are two things you can do with better light transmittance. Use the same backlight to get more brightness. Or, and this is what HP did, you can reduce the brightness coming about of the backlight and maintain the same level of brightness that gets to you. The backlight is of the CCFL variety so there's already a knock on its eco-friendly claim but the number of CCFL tubes has been reduced by half. The best option would have been a LED backlight, but that would also cost considerably more. So there is about half as much mercury in the LE2201w (and LE1901w) compared to other same-sized monitors. The backlight consumes the most power in a monitor and by reducing the light output the overall power consumption has been reduced by 40 percent.</p></p>
<p>The LE2201w consumes 30 watts when in operation and less than 2 watts in standby. The slightly smaller LE1901w consumes 23 watts when being used and less than 2 watts in standby. I would have liked to have seen standby power consumption closer to zero. These monitors are geared toward businesses and businesses will be happy with much lower electricity bills. Have a look at this calculation: 8 hours per day and 5 days per week equals to roughly 2000 hours per year. The LE191w provides about a 14 watt savings translating to 29,120 watt savings per year. Depending on how much energy costs in your area, the savings could be significant.</p>
