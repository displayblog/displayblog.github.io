<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=innolux">Innolux</a>, a Taiwan-based TFT LCD manufacturer and a unit of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=hon-hai-precision">Hon Hai Precision</a> Industry (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=foxconn">Foxconn</a>), will be delaying volume production at its <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=g6">G6</a> TFT LCD fabrication plant by about one quarter according to industry sources. The reason? Weak demand. Typically, G6 fabs are used to manufacture small LCD TV panels and large LCD monitor panels.</p>
<p>Originally the newly built G6 LCD fab was to commence operations in Q2'09. With the new schedule the G6 fab will most likely start volume production in Q3'09. Monthly capacity for the new G6 fab was originally planned for 90,000 glass substrate input per month but that has come down to just 60,000. Innolux is the only local LCD manufacturer that also assembles LCD monitors for brands such as <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dell">Dell</a>, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=hp">HP</a> and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=acer">Acer</a>.</p>
