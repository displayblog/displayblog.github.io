<p>Mitsubishi's XL650U is a LCD projector with a maximum resolution of 1600 x 1200. The XL650U's brightness specification is surprising high at 4,200 lumens. Other specifications include a 600:1 contrast ratio, two DVI inputs and wired networking. This unit doesn't come cheap at $5,995, but the unusually high resolution of 1600 x 1200 is probably one of the reasons why. The LCD is used is a 0.8" high temperature polysilicon (HTPS) LCD. The XL650U should be available now as it started shipping in December.</p>

<p>1600 x 1200 resolution on a 20" LCD monitor requires a bit of focus. Imagine working on a 50" or much larger screen via a projector like the XL650U. You get 1600 x 1200 resolution but with fonts that are much more readable. Since 1280 x 720 resolutions (720p content) can easily fit into the XL650U maximum resolution, watchin 720p HD content should not be a problem.</p>
