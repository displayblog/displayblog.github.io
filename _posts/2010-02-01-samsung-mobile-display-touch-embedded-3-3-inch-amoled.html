<p><a href="http://www.koreaittimes.com/story/7067/worlds-first-amoled-touch-function">Korea IT Times</a>: Samsung Mobile Display (SMD) is working on a new touch-enabled AMOLED panel. Instead of the usual addition of a touch layer on top of the display that leads to extra thickness, SMD's on-cell touch technology involves depositing 0.001-mm-thick capacitive touch sensors between the display's substrate and bottom polarizer film. The first fruits will be a 3.3-inch AMOLED PenTile Matrix equivalent to a LCD 800 x 480 pixel format. Samsung would then incorporate these into its own-branded smartphones as well as other OLED smartphones like the Nexus One.</p>
