<p>My first Macintosh was the Color Classic, about eight or nine years after the first Mac came out. I think it was the cutest Mac Apple has ever built. Cute because it was so tiny. And the color CRT screen was <em>nice</em>. I was a student at Cal at the time and it was just a few years before Mosaic, so all I did was word processing, email (<em>via</em> an external 14.4K baud modem), and a lot of <a href="http://macgui.net/downloads/?file_id=15423">Yahtzee!</a> Wish I had kept it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/30-years/1-24-14-film/#video-1242014-film">&acirc;&euro;&tilde;1.24.14&acirc;&euro;&trade;</a> is a new short film from <a href="http://www.apple.com/30-years/1-24-14-film/#video-1242014-film">Apple</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>On January 24, 1984, Apple introduced the Macintosh. And with it a promise that the power of technology, put in the hands of everyone, could change the world. On January 24, 2014, we sent 15 camera crews all over the world to show how that promise has become a reality.</p>
<p>From sunrise in Melbourne to nightfall in Los Angeles, they documented people doing amazing things with Apple products. They shot over 70 hours of footage &mdash; all with the iPhone 5s. Then it was edited and scored with an original soundtrack. Thanks to the power of the Mac and the innovations it has inspired, an effort that normally takes months was accomplished in a matter of days.</blockquote></p>
<p>What's notable about Apple's 30 year anniversary video is that it was shot entirely on the iPhone 5s. Lately I've been thinking maybe I need a proper &mdash; meaning expensive &mdash; camcorder to record video. Just last night I was doing some serious research on <a href="http://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagicpocketcinemacamera">Blackmagic's Pocket Cinema Camera</a>. That little Super 16 digital film camera can take some serious videos, but it also requires considerable work. I'm sure I would greatly enjoy the final results, but how often would I take it with me? How much of the footage would I actually spend time and effort to color grade? And would I have enough time and energy left to do what's required to share it with family and friends? The answers are probably going to be: not often, not much, and not a whole lot.</p>
<p>The best camcorder is the one you have with you, the one that gets color right as you're recording it, the one you can edit right in your camcorder, and the one you can share with your family and friends right there and then. And that's most likely going to be my iPhone. And if I want to do something a bit more fancy with the videos I capture, I can do that fairly easily with iMovie on a Mac.</p>
<p>Compared to the <a href="http://youtu.be/R706isyDrqI">1984 Apple commercial</a> the &acirc;&euro;&tilde;1.24.14&acirc;&euro;&trade; video isn't nearly as epic, but it beautifully demonstrates how much you can do with an iPhone and a Mac, today.</p>
