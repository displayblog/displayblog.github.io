<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=motorola&amp;sa=Search#1333">Motorola</a> has invested in Sensitive Objects, a French company that has developed a piezoelectric sensor-based touch technology called Anywhere Multitouch. Anywhere Multitouch extends <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=multitouch&amp;sa=Search#1394">multitouch</a> capabilities from the screen to the entire device. Reese Schroeder, managing director of Motorola Ventures, is excited:</p>
<blockquote><p>Natural user interface (NUI) and in particular interacting with a device through touch is an area of rapid development and great excitement.

I'm guessing this technology applied to an <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=android+smartphone&amp;sa=Search#1363">Android smartphone</a> leads to absolutely zero physical buttons. Is that a good thing? Well, anything mechanical will eventually break and with a solid state device it would be much easier to make a device that is both more rugged and more sexy. Let's see what Motorola does with Anywhere Multitouch.
