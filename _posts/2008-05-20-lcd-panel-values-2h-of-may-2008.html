<p>In the second half of May, all LCD monitor panels and notebook PC LCD panels that are both tracked by DisplaySearch and Witsview remained unchanged. I think the prices are on the brink of starting to move down as LCD manufacturers start shifting IT panel production onto large G7 and larger fabs. On the other hand, LCD TV panel prices continued to fall.</p>
<p>For the second half of May 2008, here are the top three values by application in terms of $/MP:</p>
<ol>
<strong>LCD monitor panel</strong></p>
<li>20" 1680 x 1050 at 81.07 $/MP (previous month 81.07 $/MP)<br />
</li>
<li>22" 1680 x 1050 at 90.70 $/MP (90.70 $/MP)<br />
</li>
<li>17" 1280 x 1024 at 93.46 $/MP (93.46 $/MP)<br />
</li></ol><br />
Since no prices have changed for LCD monitor panels, 20" 1680 x 1050 continued to be the best value in LCD monitor panels at just 81.07 $/MP.</p>
<ol>
<strong>NBPC panel</strong></p>
<li>17.0" 1440 x 900 at 94.14 $/MP (94.14 $/MP)</li>
<li>14.1" 1280 x 800 at 94.73 $/MP (94.73 $/MP)</li>
<li>15.4" 1280 x 800 at 97.66 $/MP (97.66 $/MP)</li><br />
</ol><br />
No changes in 2H of May: 17.0" 1440 x 900 is on top, 14.1" 1280 x 800 is second.</p>
<ol>
<strong>LCD TV panel</strong></p>
<li>26" 1366 x 768 at 219.24 $/MP (221.62 $/MP)<br />
</li>
<li>32" 1366 x 768 at 302.64 $/MP (304.07 $/MP)<br />
</li>
<li>37" 1366 x 768 at 352.04 $/MP (407.50 $/MP)<br />
</li></ol><br />
The results for LCD TV panels are fairly straightforward because all three have the same number of pixels. Unfortunately, 1080p LCD TV panel prices were not publicly available from both market research companies. DisplaySearch posted a $730 (down $5) price on a 46" 1080p LCD TV panel that puts the value at 352.04 $/MP (previously 354.46 $/MP), a much better value than 37". I think LCD TV panel values will increase (prices will drop) in the next several months, especially for 32" as Sharp and others will be loading that size onto very large LCD fabs. The competition between 40" and 42" continues and that will result in some very good values for consumers. Major brands will probably compete in the sub-$1000 42" LCD TV space later this year.</p>
<p>Note: For those who purchase LCD panels, this set of information might be interesting. I took publicly available pricing information for LCD panels from Witsview and DisplaySearch, took the average, and then did some analysis on maximum value.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this blog post, maximum value is defined as dollar per megapixel ($/MP, lower is better). What this value shows is how many pixels you are getting for each dollar. Many might say that overall diagonal size is a much more important indicator and that might be true. But given the same size, I prefer a higher resolution LCD leading me to conclude that I value the number of pixels.</p>
<p>The value of pixels can be seen clearly in the trend toward 1080p in LCD TVs. Given the same size, say 42", most consumers will desire a 1080p model compared to a 720p. The recent trend toward 1080p 32" LCD TVs is another case in point.</p>
