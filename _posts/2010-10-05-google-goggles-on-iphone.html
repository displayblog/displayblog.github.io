<p><a href="http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2010/10/open-your-eyes-google-goggles-now.html">Google Mobile Blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the new version of Google Mobile App just tap on the camera button to search using Goggles. Goggles will analyze the image and highlight the objects it recognizes -- just click on them to find out more.</p>
<p>Computer vision is a hard problem and Google Goggles is still a Labs product. It works well for things such as landmarks, logos and the covers of books, DVDs and games. However, it doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t yet work for some things you might want to try like animals, plants or food.</blockquote></p>
<p>Awesome, and on the iPhone.</p>
