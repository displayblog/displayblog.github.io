<p><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Oculus+Rift+CV1+Teardown/60612">iFixit</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two OLED displays with a combined resolution of 2160x1200</li>
<li>90 FPS refresh rate</li>
<li>Accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer</li>
<li>360-degree headset tracking via Constellation IR camera</li>
<li>Horizontal field of view greater than 100&ordm;</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>A combined 2160x1200 pixel format, means 1080x1200 each. According to iFixit each OLED display is 90mm for a resolution of about 456ppi, which means you'll need to be 8 inches from the display to have a 'retina' experience -- an experience where you can't see individual pixels. (Your eyes are not far enough using the Oculus Rift and so you'll see pixels.)</p>
<p>OLEDs have fast response times and are the only feasible display technology -- manufacturing infrastructure, tech maturity, price, etc. -- today that won't make you sick due to pixel lag.</p>
