<p><a href="http://www.sony.net/Products/4k-ultra-short-throw/">Sony</a>: I'm quite excited about the Sony 4K Ultra Short Throw Projector, which projects a 147-inch image on the wall. The projector is hidden inside a modern piece of furniture; just make sure you don't put something on top of the cover that opens up. I wonder if Sony can improve upon this design and use glass that turns opaque when not in use and turns transparent when you turn it on. That way there's no mechanical piece that can break. Looking at the photos it seems there are speaker units connected on each end. Even better.</p>
<p>I like the way Sony is thinking: This minimalistic design allows the display to disappear, completely. One major eyesore in almost all homes are thin TVs protruding out of the wall because of thick mounts. Thin TVs standing on thick furniture is also a design oxymoron. The design approach where technology disappears when you're not using it is my type of approach. The only limitation is if the interior design of the room doesn't match the design of the 4K Ultra Short Throw Projector. If the price is right, I know just the place to put it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/6/5267578/sony-xperia-z1-compact-launch-ces-2014">The Verge</a>: The Sony Xperia Z1 Compact is a high-end Android smartphone that's not humongous, with a 4.3-inch IPS LCD. I <em>think</em> this is the closest competition the iPhone 5/5s/5c has if you're in the market for a high end smartphone that's around 4 inches. The pixel format is 1280x720 and translates to a resolution of 342 ppi, a bit more dense than the 326-ppi iPhone 5. It's waterproof too, just like its bigger brother.</p>
