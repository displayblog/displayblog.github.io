<p><a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1670465/a-movement-to-teach-young-designers-to-build-experimental-bikes">Kelsey Campbell-Dollaghan, Co.Design</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Building a bike is an expensive and time-consuming process, traditionally reserved for devoted hobbyists and the very wealthy. But as cycling gains a stronger foothold in American cities, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s likely that such skills will become more commonplace in design education programs. Leading the way is Nicholas Riddle, a designer at Easton and the founder of the <a href="http://www.cca.edu/news/2012/04/17/urban-mobility-cca">Urban Mobility Lab</a> at the California College of the Arts.</blockquote></p>
<p>The class is US$3,250. Expensive, yes, but you learn a skill you get to keep and build upon. Craft your own custom bike, or many of them.</p>
