<p>The <a href="http://benq.com/products/LCD/?product=1458&amp;page=features">BenQ</a> G2220HD is a 22-inch LCD monitor sporting a 16:9 aspect ratio with a pixel format of 1920x1080. The 22-inch is actually 21.5. Viewing angles are a bit limited at 170/160 due to the TN LCD panel but the response time is relatively fast at 5ms, fairly bright at 300 cd/m2 and the static contrast ratio of 1000:1 is pretty good for a monitor. There are two connections: DVI-D with HDCP and VGA. When I see a 16:9 LCD panel mated with a DVI connection, I wonder if the left hand was talking to the right hand. Clearly the G2220HD is geared for those who want to watch HD content on the monitor. It would seem obvious that an HDMI connection would be the better choice. The best option would have been to have added an additional HDMI connection and increase the price by $5-$10.</p>
