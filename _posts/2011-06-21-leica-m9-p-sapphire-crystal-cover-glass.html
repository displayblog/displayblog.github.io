<blockquote><p>The Leica M9-P now features an extremely scratch-resistant, almost unbreakable, sapphire crystal cover for its LCD monitor display. Sapphire crystal is one of the world's hardest materials and so hard that it can only be worked with special diamond-cutting tools. The antireflective coating on both sides of the monitor cover glass further improves image reviewing, particularly in unfavorable lighting conditions.</blockquote></p>
<p>Gorilla Glass by Corning probably wasn't good enough. I'd love to see a cover glass made with extremely scratch-resistant, almost unbreakable, sapphire crystal adorn an iPhone.</p>
