<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/blackest-is-the-new-black-scientists-have-developed-a-material-so-dark-that-you-cant-see-it-9602504.html">The Independent</a>: Developed by British company Surrey NanoSystems, Vantablack is a material made of carbon nanotubes that absorbs 99.96% of light.</p>
<blockquote><p>It is so dark that the human eye cannot understand what it is seeing. Shapes and contours are lost, leaving nothing but an apparent abyss.</blockquote></p>
<p>I wonder if you could sprinkle a little Vantablack on LCDs.</p>
