excerpt: "<a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=hannstar\">HannStar
  Display</a> (<a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=hsd\">HSD</a>)
  is a small Taiwan LCD supplier among giants such as <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=au-optronics\">AU
  Optronics</a> (<a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=auo\">AUO</a>)
  and <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=chi-mei-optoelectronics\">Chi
  Mei Optoelectronics</a> (<a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=cmo\">CMO</a>).
  LCD panel prices have dropped like a rock over the last several months and most
  LCD manufacturers are not making much profits, if at all, on LCD panels.\r\n\r\nMajor
  suppliers such as <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lg-display\">LG
  Display</a> (<a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lpl\">LPL</a>),
  AUO, CMO and others have reduced LCD fab utilization rates to restore the supply
  and demand balance but due to demand for LCD goods souring on a global basis the
  reduced utilization rates have had little impact to stall price declines. HSD's
  utilization rate in November was 50% and that number is expected to decline in December.
  Come January 2009, due to reduced work days thanks to long holidays, HSD's utilization
  will continue to decline. "

<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=hannstar">HannStar Display</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=hsd">HSD</a>) is a small Taiwan LCD supplier among giants such as <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=au-optronics">AU Optronics</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=auo">AUO</a>) and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=chi-mei-optoelectronics">Chi Mei Optoelectronics</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=cmo">CMO</a>).

<p>Because of the excrutiatingly difficult environment, HSD is considering selling its LCD panels only to its in-house brand: <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=hannsg">HannsG</a>. HSD's total LCD monitor panel shipments in November (including to HannsG) decreased 34.5% M/M to 503K units. It is my opinion that HannsG will require rock-bottom prices as well since the brand's strength is affordable pricing. Even if HSD were to sell just to HannsG there will need to be internal fund transfers to keep HSD from hemoraghing money.</p>
