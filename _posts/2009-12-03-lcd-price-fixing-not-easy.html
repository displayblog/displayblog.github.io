<p>There are many many small/medium TFT LCD manufacturers. And according to a sources within Taiwan's panel sector LCD price fixing is not very easy. This is in response to <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/11/30/nokia-sues-lcd-suppliers/">Nokia suing pretty much anyone that manufactures small/medium TFT LCD panels</a>. AU Optronics (AUO) also announced on December 2 that it has not been served formal documents. There are many LCD suppliers that focus on small/medium LCD panels but the larger players such as LG Display, Samsung, AUO, Chi Mei Optoelectronics (CMO), etc. also play in that market. I think I agree with the assessment that with so many suppliers it would be difficult at best to agree to a single price for certain LCD panels.
