<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=samsung">Samsung</a> is planning to increase prices for its LCD monitor panel prices in January 2009. Demand has been on the decline for several months for LCD monitors and the LCD panel prices reflect that: prices have tumbled to historic lows. The first half of each calendar year is also quite horrible for LCD monitor sales. So why would Samsung increase prices for its LCD monitor panels next month? I don't think it's a great idea but maybe Samsung knows something that every other company doesn't. Samsung <em>has</em> been doing quite well as a brand.</p>
