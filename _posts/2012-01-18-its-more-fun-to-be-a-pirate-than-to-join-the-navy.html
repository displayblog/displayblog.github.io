<p>Steve Jobs said that back in the days when the original Mac was being developed. <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1665840/an-hr-lesson-from-steve-jobs-if-you-want-change-agents-hire-pirates">Peter Sander, Co.Design</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Steve looked for the pirate in all his team members. But it wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t enough just to be brilliant, and it wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t enough just to think different. Steve&acirc;&euro;&trade;s pirates had to have the passion, the drive, and the shared vision to want to delight the customer with a perfect, game-changing product. Steve was constantly worried that as Apple grew, it would become like other big companies: tied up in bureaucracy, with a hundred reasons why something couldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be done. Pirates with passion would not let this happen. In keeping with this idea, Steve wanted his pirates not only for the product development organizations, but also for routine business functions like accounting and even his administrative assistants.</blockquote></p>
