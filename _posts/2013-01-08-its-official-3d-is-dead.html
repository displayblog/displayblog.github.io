<p>Vlad Savov, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3852452/death-of-3d">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As a technology, you're not dead when everybody hates and derides you. Neither will limited commercial sales kill off your chances. But indifference of the kind signalled by this year's CES is the truest symptom of a terminal trajectory.</blockquote></p>
<p>Just as no average Joe cared when every TV brand came to CES in previous years with 3D versions, the average Joe doesn't care when not one TV brand is touting 3D at CES this year. CES has been, is, and will be a poor barometer as to what Joe cares about. Personally, I'm glad the marketers have moved on from 3D to 4K and OLED.</p>
