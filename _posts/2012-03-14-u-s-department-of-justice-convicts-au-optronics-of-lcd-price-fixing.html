<p><a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/March/12-at-313.html">The United States Department of Justice</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Following an eight-week trial, a federal jury in San Francisco today convicted the largest Taiwan liquid crystal display (LCD) producer, its Houston-based subsidiary and their two former top executives for their participation in a five-year conspiracy to fix the prices of thin-film transistor-liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) panels sold worldwide, the Department of Justice announced.  The jury also found that the ill-gotten gain to the conspirators as a result of the fixed sales in the United States was at least $500 million.</blockquote></p>
<p>The maximum fine for AUO is US$1 billion.</p>
