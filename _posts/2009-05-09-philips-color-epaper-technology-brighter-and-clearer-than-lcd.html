  Research has developed a new color <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=epaper&amp;sa=Search#1512\">epaper</a>
  technology that is brighter and clearer than LCD. Kars-Michiel Lenssen headed the
  work at Philips Research. This new color epaper technology is three times brighter
  than displays that require the use of a color filter; LCD technology for the most
  part requires a color filter, an optical layer that absorbs a considerable amount
  of brightness. According to Lenssen, \"This is the closest an electronic-paper technology
  ever gotto printed paper.\"\r\n\r\nThe common epaper technology, which is currently

  field is applied the particles migrate to the top of the microcapsule and changing

<p>Philips Research turned the traditional epaper pixel on its side in order to tune it to different shades of color. The approach is called in-plane electrophoretics that involves suspending colored particles in a clear liquid and moving them horizontally instead of vertically. Each epaper pixel is composed of two microcapsule chambers with one containing yellow and cyan particles and the other containing magenta and black particles. Within each microcapsule one set of colored particles is charged positively while the other is charged negatively.</p>
<p>Voltage is carefully controlled and applied to the electrodes that are located at the edges of the pixels. The colored particles can be spread across the entire pixel or removed from view by hiding them under the electrodes. Shades of color is generated by controlling how many of each group of colored particles are visible. To generate a white pixel all of the particles are shifted underneath the electrodes and the white substrate underneath is revealed. Philips' in-plane electrophoretics make use of cheaper and simpler electronics to address the pixels that lead to easier manufacturing especially flexible displays.</p>
