<p>The enTourage Pocket eDGe is a dual-screen e-reader with an E Ink display on the left an a LCD on the right. From what I can tell you can jot down notes on the E Ink display: something that I think all e-book readers should allow you to do. I'm looking at you iPad.</p>
<p>I can imagine myself needing to understand a term more fully and pulling up Wikipedia on the right while still having the page open where I'm reading on the left. I wonder what else it can do. I guess I'll be finding out at CES.</p>
