<p><a href="http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2008/08/lenovo-subnoteb.html">Wired</a> &rarr; <a href="http://aving.net/usa/news/default.asp?mode=read&amp;c_num=95563&amp;C_Code=02&amp;SP_Num=0&amp;mn_name=">AVING</a>: Netbooks aren't just for 2nd tier brands anymore. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lenovo">Lenovo</a>, a major brand, has jumped into the netbook arena with one of its own: the IdeaPad S10. The S10 sports a 10.2" wide TFT LCD with a pixel format of 1024x600, which is fairly standard for netbooks with this display size. The 1024 is crucial if you want to surf the net without having to constantly move left and right. The LCD has a LED backlight: thinner than a CCFL backlight and has the potential to save a bit in the energy consumption category.</p>

<p>The design isn't unique and looks similar to many other netbooks from a myriad of companies. But the overall look seems to be on the sleek and simple side, the way I like it. There is, however, a unique feature: a MacBook Air (and MacBook Pro) like multitouch trackpad that can recognize gestures. The IdeaPad S10 is very competitively priced at $399 for the low-end version and even the "high-end" version is just $50 more that includes more RAM and a bigger hard drive.</p>
