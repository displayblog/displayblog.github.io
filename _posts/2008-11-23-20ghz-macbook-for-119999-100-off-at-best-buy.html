<p>If you want to purchase <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=apple">Apple</a> products, you almost always pay full price, give or take a few dollars. Of course if you're "connected" you can get additional discounts but that's the case with almost every brand out there. So for all who are not connected, get on over to Best Buy because you can get the new <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=macbook">MacBook</a> running at 2.0GHz for $1199.99. That's $100 off the MSRP of $1299.99. Is this price legitimate? At the time of this writing, it seems to be. But nobody knows how long this will last. The new <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=macbook-air">MacBook Air</a> (1.6GHz, 120GB HD) is already sold out online.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure that a Best Buy store is within a few minutes of everyone living in the US, so click on "Pick Up" and you won't need to pay the $19.99 shipping and handling fee.</p>
