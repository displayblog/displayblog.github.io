<p><a href="http://ces.cnet.com/8301-31045_1-10424089-269.html">cnet</a>: The Sony VAIO F is a handsome 16.4-inch notebook PC sporting a 1920 x 1080 pixel format. A unique option of the VAIO F is a <em>recordable</em> Blu-ray drive. I wonder if Sony's movie division will have a fit. GPU power comes from NVIDIA's GeForce GT300M while CPU duties are carried on by Intel's Core i7-720QM.</p>
<p>Another interesting feature is the company's Transfer Jet technology. Place a compatible digital camera on a specified spot on the wrist rest area on the VAIO F and photos wirelessly gets transferred. How neat is that? Of course, you'll need both the new VAIO F and a Transfer Jet-capable digital camera from Sony. I hope Sony open sources its Transfer Jet technology but I'm not holding my breath.</p>
<p>I have shared my preference for a centered keyboard on notebook PCs, but it is unfortunate to see the left-shifted keyboard and trackpad on the new VAIO F. How many users really need the numeric keypad? I don't know of many, unless you're working behind a retail counter, where I don't see the VAIO F spending much time. The VAIO F starts around US$1000 and <a href="http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?catalogId=10551&amp;storeId=10151&amp;langId=-1&amp;categoryId=8198552921644691999">can be pre-ordered on Sony's site</a>.</p>
