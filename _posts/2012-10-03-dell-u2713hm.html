<blockquote><p>The U2713HM lists for $799 and though Dell often has sales on their displays I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t know how much this will affect this model. Compared to the $650 HP ZR2740w you get better pre-calibration and post-calibration results, more inputs, an OSD system, USB 3.0 support, and the same contrast ratios. If prices were equal from a sale, I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d pick the Dell U2713HM over the HP unless I absolutely needed faster response times for gaming that the HP offers due to its lack of a scaler. Even then, the Dell might be the exact same at gaming when using the native 2560x1440 resolution.</blockquote></p>
<p>I think $800 for a 109-ppi 27-inch monitor with 2560x1440 pixels is a bit much at a time when you can get a better quality 264-ppi 9.7-inch display with 2048x1536 pixels for $500. For $1 you get 4613 pixels with the U2713HM. On the iPad (3) you get 6304 pixels; that's 37% more. The same logic applies to the even more expensive $999 Apple Thunderbolt Display.</p>
<p>The writing is on the wall: displays will go retina, software will go retina. So if at all possible get a retina display today on the iPad or wait for large displays to go retina in the near future.</p>
