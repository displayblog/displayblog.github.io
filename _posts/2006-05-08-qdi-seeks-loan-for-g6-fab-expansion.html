<p>QDI is pursuing a loan of about NT$20 billion (~US$630 million) to add capacity to its existing G6 TFT LCD fab up to 60,000 glass substrate input capacity per month. Currently QDI&#39;s G6 input capacity is 45,000 per month. The G6 fab is optimized to manufacture 32" and 37" LCD TV panels. The loan should not be that difficult to acquire since AUO announced that it will purchase QDI recently.</p>
