<p>One of the coolest things about Planar's Clarity c70SPw-based DLP cube that was showcased at InfoComm 2008 was not only the size with four 1080p displays but that there were virtually no borders among them. The high definition content goes all the way to the edge of the screen. Although LCD and plasma guys are continuing to shrink the bezel, it will be a long time before we see anything like what I saw from Planar and others at InfoComm 2008.</p>
