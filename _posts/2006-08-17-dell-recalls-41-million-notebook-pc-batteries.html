<p>This is old news by now and does not relate directly to displays. But, since it relates to notebook PCs that do have displays, I'll post up a quick reminder to all who have Dell notebooks:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.engadget.com/media/2006/06/toastylappy.jpg" height="340" width="425" /></p>
<p>Dell is recalling 4.1 million notebook PC batteries that were manufactured by Sony. This is in response to alleged blowing up of batteries (three counts: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/07/31/dell-laptop-number-3-explodes/">one</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/07/20/dell-knew-about-dozens-of-burned-laptops-two-years-before-reca/">two</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/06/22/dude-your-dell-is-on-fire/">three</a>: Thanks engadget!) and some other incidents where overheating caused property damage. Sony will support Dell in this endeavor financially and stated that the problem in the batteries has been solved. I sure hope so.</p>

<p>If you have a battery that has these serial numbers, make sure to contact Dell and get a replacement ASAP! The Dell models that are involved in this recall are:</p>
<p>Latitude: D410, D500, D505, D510, D520, D600, D610, D620, D800, D810<br />
Inspiron: 500M, 510M, 600M, 700M, 710M, 6000, 6400, 8500, 8600, 9100, 9200, 9300, 9400, E1505, E1705<br />
Precision: M20, M60, M70, M90<br />
XPS: XPS, XPS Gen2, XPS M170, XPS M1710</p>
<p>If you own one of these notebooks make sure to take the battery out and look for the serial number and see if it matches one of these:</p>
<p>1K055, 3K590, 5P474, 6P922, 6P922, C2603, C5339, C5340, C5446, C6269, C6270, D2961, D5555, D6024, D6025, F2100, F5132, GD785, H3191, JD616, JD617, KD494, M3006, RD857, TD349, U5867, U5882, W5915, X5308, X5329, X5332, X5333, X5875, X5877, Y1333, Y4500, Y5466.</p>

<p>Make sure to go to <a href="https://www.dellbatteryprogram.com/Default.aspx">Dell's Battery Recall page</a> and read all of the instructions. Here is the <a href="https://www.dellbatteryprogram.com/regionalSupport.aspx">Dell Battery Recall Support Customer Numbers page</a>. The unfortunate thing about all of this is that there is speculation that Dell new about its batteries being damaged due to heat. What's up, Dell?</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> I found a very interesting <a href="http://www.itworld.com/Man/3917/nls_solutions_dell060715/">article by Joel Shore at ITWorld.com</a>. Shore explains that this is Dell's fifth battery recall in six years. He also states that Dell is not the only brand that is suffering from battery problems: HP, Apple, Compaq, TI, etc. all have had battery recalls. Go to his article, he's got some pretty interesting information including a government site (U.S Consumer Product Safety Commission: <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/">www.cpsc.gov</a>) that shows everybody's recall information. Shore did mention how Toshiba was the lone brand that did not have a recall concerning batteries. I personally think the batteries are experiencing quality problems because they are no longer being manufactured in countries that have strict quality controls and in a country that values quantity over quality, with quality being just an afterthought.</p>
