<blockquote><p>Active matrix OLED (AMOLED) displays are using on-cell touch, while TFT LCD makers are focusing on in-cell touch technology for high-resolution LTPS. Currently, the top two global smart phone brands&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Apple and Samsung&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;are leading the adoption of these approaches. In the case of the Samsung Galaxy S2 and S3, AMOLED technology is being coupled with on-cell touch, and Apple is expected to to incorporate in-cell touch in combination with LTPS TFT LCD on the iPhone5, which is expected in 2H'12.</blockquote></p>
