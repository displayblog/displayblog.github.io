<p>I believe this is the very first OLED TV product that will actually be available for purchase by a regular consumer, that is, if you're living in Japan on December 1st. The design is a little different, I must say. The pixel format is not quite HD, but sufficient for DVD playback and standard TV. HD could very well look fantastic on a OLED screen even if scaled down. The 1 million to one contrast ratio should lend to very good pictures. The price of $1740 is a bit on the high side for just a 11" TV, but isn't so far out there that early adopters would completely shy away from. And at just 3.3lbs, the XEL-1 is more than portable. I would hope Sony will introduce the one and only OLED TV in the US market as well, soon.</p>
<p>Update: The XEL-1 has been available in the US for quite some time since earlier this year (2008). <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00126W14O?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=displ0f-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00126W14O">Amazon.com has the world's first commercially available OLED TV, the XEL-1, for $2499.99</a>, a bit more than our Japanese friends.</p>
