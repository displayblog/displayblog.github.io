<p>That's the title of a <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/toshiba-to-be-sole-supplier-of-iphone-lcds/91181">Cult of Mac</a> post:</p>
<blockquote><p>A report in Japanese newspaper Nikkan Kogyu Shimbun claims that &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Sharp was no longer a candidate for Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s investment,&acirc;&euro;¬ù and that the company wishes to avoid placing full dependancy on one country for the production of iPhone LCDs. It is believed the Tohoku area earthquake &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; which could have effected component production &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; may have persuaded Apple to think twice about its investment in two suppliers located in Japan.</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple is currently fully dependent on LG Display and Samsung for its iPhone 4 Retina Display. Both of the companies are located in South Korea.</p>
