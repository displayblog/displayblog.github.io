<p>That's PER MONTH. 32" LCD TV sets are by far the most popular. There are two reasons: price and size. The world's average size for TVs has been around 26"/27" at a 4:3 aspect ratio. Since most people look at the height to decipher bigness, going wide at 16:9 will net you around 32". So no wonder 32" is so popular. Well, Samsung seems to be riding the wave with 32" LCD TVs and its internal TFT LCD business unit can't seem to supply the brand with enough panels. So, like what Sony and Sharp have already done, Samsung has went outside its own home to Chunghwa Picture Tubes (CPT).</p>
<p>CPT will be supplying Samsung with 100,000 32" LCD TV panels per month. That's 1.2 million panels per year and will make CPT one of the largest supplier of LCD TV panels to Samsung. This will also enable CPT to squeeze out costs of manufacturing as they ramp its G6 plant.</p>
