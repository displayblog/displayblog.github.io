<p><a href="http://www.friedrichonline.net/2011/08/the-big-decision-air-vs-pro/">Benjamin Friedrich</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Between the Pro and the Air, the Air&acirc;&euro;&trade;s display is substantially better. The Air has a higher pixel density, which makes a big difference. When you look at an Air and a Pro side by side, the Pro&acirc;&euro;&trade;s screen looks like it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s covered in tiny lego bricks.</blockquote></p>
