<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/8/11/5983635/acer-chromebook-13-nvidia-tegra-k1-processor-price-availability">The Verge</a>: The Acer Chromebook 13 sports NVIDIA's Tegra K1, a powerful quad core SoC geared for mobile devices. Two display options are available, but you'll want to pony up the extra $100 for the 1920x1080 pixels, extra RAM, and larger SSD.</p>
<p>Combine a 1920x1080 13-inch display with a 32GB SSD, 4GB RAM, NVIDIA's Tegra K1, and a battery that lasts 11 hours, the asking price of US$379 looks like a good deal.</p>
<p>(The all-white enclosure, which I like, reminds of the discontinued white unibody polycarbonate MacBook, which by the way can be had for about the same price on Craigslist. You lose a bunch of pixels and the all-day battery life, but you gain a full-blown computer.)</p>
