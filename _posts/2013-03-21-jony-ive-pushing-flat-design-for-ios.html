<p>Jessica E. Lessin, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/03/21/apple-design-teams-get-cozier/">The Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some suggested that in Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s next mobile operating system, Ive is pushing a more &acirc;&euro;&oelig;flat design&acirc;&euro;¬ù that is starker and simpler, according to developers who have spoken to Apple employees but didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have further details. Overall, they expect any changes to be pretty conservative.</blockquote></p>
<p>If flat means simpler and more elegant, I'm all for it, but most important is a more intuitive design.</p>
