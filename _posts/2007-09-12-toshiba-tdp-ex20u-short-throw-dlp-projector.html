<p class="P1">The pixel format of 1024 x 768 should be 1366 x 768 so it can multi-purpose in use: work and play. There are two features that stand out: wireless and PC-less. Setup requires no cables and can be accomplished via a 802.11b/g connection. This is a definite plus as you won't need to watch the juggling of a long twisted thick cable among presenters. The PC-less feature allows for presentations to be made via a USB drive, but the format must be in JPEG, not PPT. So, though the feature is good, the implementation is terrible. I know of no professional who makes presentations in JPEG format. Maybe it is geared for the home where you simple want to show off some pictures you took. Maybe, but maybe not. You see, the process is not all that simple. To get the JPEG files onto a USB drive this is what you need to do:</p></p>
<ol>
<li>Connect digital camera to PC.</li>
<li>Import JPEG pictures into PC.</li>
<li>Connect USB drive to PC.</li>
<li>Export/copy JPEG pictures to USB drive.</li><br />
</ol></p>
<p class="P1">So clearly the feature of PC-less JPEG presentations are flawed. You can bypass steps 3 and 4 by directly connecting the PC. A notable mention is the short-throw feature that allows for a 60" image from just 3 feet away. However, I wonder why. If you have a small room that require a short-throw projector, the experience of watching a 60" image from just several feet away might not be all that great. Overall, this projector is a bunch of technologies put together without much thought to the user experience.</p></p>
