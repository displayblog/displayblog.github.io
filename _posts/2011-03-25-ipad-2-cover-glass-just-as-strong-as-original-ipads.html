<blockquote><p>It turns out that the iPad 2 glass is just as strong as the original iPad&acirc;&euro;&trade;s glass and because it is is a bit more flexible has more bending tolerances.</blockquote></p>
<p>The cover glass on the iPad 2 is about 27% thinner than the one found on the original iPad, and is just as strong.</p>
