<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2012/02/01/apple-passes-lg-to-become-worlds-third-largest-mobile-phone-manufacturer/">MacRumors</a>. <a href="http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS23297412">IDC</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple jumped into the third spot globally from the fifth spot last quarter thanks to a record-breaking quarter of shipments. That represents the Cupertino-based company's highest-ever ranking on IDC's Top 5 global mobile phone leaderboard. The launch of Apple's iPhone 4S smartphone, which is now available in over 90 countries (as of mid-January), was the primary reason the company leapt over LG and ZTE in 4Q11. Device sales in the U.S. and Japan were particularly strong given extra sales days in the quarter and carrier distribution.</blockquote></p>
<p>As mobile phones shift to smartphones, where Apple is number one, the upward trend should continue. <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2012/02/02/third/">Horace Dediu has a lot of great looking charts</a>.</p>
