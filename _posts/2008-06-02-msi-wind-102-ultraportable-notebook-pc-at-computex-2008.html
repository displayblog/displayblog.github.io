What's interesting is that according to the company the exterior is scratch-proof. Now that's an important development. The colors are pretty unique and it's interesting to note that black is associated with bad as in Star Wars Imperial bad. The ultraportable notebook PC market is getting really crowded with <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/06/02/rumor-quanta-to-build-sony-ultraportable-notebook-pc/">rumors of Sony getting into the action</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2008.06.03 9:36AM PST</strong><br />
According to <a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/~r/gizmodo/full/~3/303608543/msi-wind-given-45-out-of-five-by-laptop-magazine">Gizmodo</a>, the folks over at <a href="http://www.laptopmag.com/review/laptops/msi-wind.aspx">Laptop Magazine</a> gave the MSI Wind a strong 4.5 out of five. Here's a quote from the review:</p>
<blockquote><p>If there were a Survivor: The Mini-Notebook series, and each of the ultra-low-cost notebooks were incrementally eliminated, the MSI Wind NB would be the one left standing. Unlike its competitors, the Wind NB offers the complete package, including an adult-size keyboard, a larger 10-inch screen, and a very capable Atom processor. This system's solid performance, stellar 5-plus hours of battery life, and $499 price make it the best all-around mini-notebook to date.</blockquote></p>
