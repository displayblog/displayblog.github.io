<p>Walt Disney's CEO Bob Iger:</p>
<blockquote><p>We find that iPad has a lot of potential. We think it's a really compelling device. We think it could be a game changer in terms of enabling us to create essentially new forms of content. Obviously it will be a great device to play games on and to watch videos because of the clarity of the screen.</blockquote><br />
It isn't surprising that Disney is excited about the iPad: Steve Jobs is the largest shareholder of Disney. I'm looking forward to all Disney content coming to the iPad. Hmm... speaking of Disney, I could get behind a kids version of the iPad that's a bit more durable with a lower price point.
