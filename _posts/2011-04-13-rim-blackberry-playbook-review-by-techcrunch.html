<p>MG Siegler at <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/13/blackberry-playbook-review/">TechCrunch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The screen on the PlayBook is very nice. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a 1024&Atilde;&mdash;600 WSVGA capacitive LCD touch screen. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s certainly not a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Retina&acirc;&euro;¬ù display, but the iPad doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have that either.</blockquote></p>
<p>The screen is very nice, but not Retina nice. That's it?</p>
