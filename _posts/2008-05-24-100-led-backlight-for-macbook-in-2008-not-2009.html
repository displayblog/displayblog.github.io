<p>DigiTimes is reporting that the Chinese-language Economic Daily News (EDN) is reporting that Kenmos Technology, a Taiwan-based backlight unit (BLU) manufacturer, will benefit when all of Apple's MacBooks shed CCFL BLUs in favor of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led">LED</a> BLUs in 2009. This is in light of Kenmos being <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=apple">Apple</a>'s main supplier for LED BLUs in 2007. According to EDN, LED BLUs might contribute NT$2 billion (US$66 million) or more to revenues for Kenmos in 2008.</p>

<p>I say Kenmos will get a big boost THIS year. Why? It is my opinion that <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=macbook">MacBook</a>s will sport LED backlights this year, not next. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dell">Dell</a> has its XPS <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=m1330">M1330</a> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=notebook-pc">notebook PC</a> that feature a 13.3" LED backlit LCD. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sony">Sony</a> has its SZ Series notebook PCs that feature one too. Apple can't be too far away from introducing LED backlit MacBooks to the mainstream. </p>
<p>The economies of scale should be shrinking the cost of manufacturing a 13.3" LCD with a LED backlight due to it being incorporate in Apple's <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s="macbook+air"">MacBook Air</a>. Since the MacBook is a more affordable notebook PC, I am sure Apple had to wait for the prices to drop a bit so prices can remain unchanged even with the LED backlight. I think this will happen this year.</p>
