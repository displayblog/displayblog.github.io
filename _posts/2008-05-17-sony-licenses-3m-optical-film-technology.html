<p>On May 16, 2008, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=3m">3M</a> and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sony">Sony</a> announced a licensing agreement that gives Sony the right to use certain 3M <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=%22optical+film%22">optical film</a> technologies for use in LCD TVs. The licensing deal covers prismatic films for use in making LCD panels. Optical films are essential in improving brightness by recycling light. 3M's brightness enhancement film (BEF) and double brightness enhancement film (DBEF) is almost required in most LCD TV designs to get brightness to where it is today. Recently, there has been movement away from LCD TV backlights using DBEF due to high costs.</p>
