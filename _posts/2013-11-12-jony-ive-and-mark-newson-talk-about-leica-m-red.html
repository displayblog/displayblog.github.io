<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://leicarumors.com/2013/11/11/jony-ive-and-marc-newson-on-the-one-of-a-kind-leica-m-red-camera.aspx/">Leica News & Rumors</a>. Jony Ive and Mark Newson don't talk much about the design process of the Leica M (RED) in <a href="http://youtu.be/OF1ZzrKpnjg">this YouTube video</a>, but what is admirable is the purpose for which they worked so hard: helping those who are in need. What I am about to say is trivial compared to that purpose, but: The industrial design of the Leica M (RED) is too round and lacks a certain austerity that befits a Leica.</p>
