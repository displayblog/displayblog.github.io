<p>Andy Ihnatko, <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/technology/ihnatko/2829294,ihnatko-windows-iphone-android-phone-102310.article">Chicago Sun-Times</a>, regarding Windows Phone 7:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve been stuck in The World Of The iPhone Clones for far too long. I applaud Windows Phone 7 for trying to push things forward, and to present the people who haven&acirc;&euro;&trade;t warmed to iPhone or Android with the first useful, workable alternative.</blockquote></p>
<p>I really like the emphasis on typography on WP7. I wonder if we'll be able to change the system font on WP7...</p>
