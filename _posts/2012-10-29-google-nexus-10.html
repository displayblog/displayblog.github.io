<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/29/3568784/nexus-10-preview-price-release-date">The Verge</a>: True RGB Real Stripe PLS. That's what Google calls the 300-ppi 10.055-inch 2560x1600 PLS LCD. First, I guess there were enough fake RGB displays out there to make the point of the Nexus 10 sporting real RGB. Second, I thought it ridiculous Google would specify the display with so many decimal places. Now I know why: With 10.1 inches the resolution doesn't get to 300 ppi. With 10.055 inches the resolution hits 300.24 ppi.</p>
<p>The iPad mini is in trouble. The 7.9-inch IPS LCD sports a pixel format of 1024x768, and it costs US$329. The 10.055-inch Google Nexus 10 packs in 2560x1600 pixels, and it costs just $70 more (for the 16GB version). I am aware the display isn't everything; what you do with the display is just as important. For instance, there are very few tablet specific Android apps that make use of all the additional pixels on a tablet. The Nexus 10 with 2560x1600 pixels will be a huge challenge. The iPad mini, on the other hand, has tens of thousands thanks to it having the same pixel format as the original iPad and the iPad 2. I get that, but the additional hardware you get for only $70 extra is tremendous: The Nexus 10 has over <em>four million</em> pixels compared to just 786K on the iPad mini. Come to think of it the retina iPad, which is $100 more than the Nexus 10, is also going to be a hard sell.</p>
<p>The Nexus 10 doesn't have cellular modems, so far. If data connectivity is important to you and you need speed the LTE-capable iPad is your best option. If WiFi is good enough there is no other tablet that gets you more than the Nexus 10.</p>
<p>The hardware is top notch, the design not so much. I lean toward straight clean lines and the Nexus 10 doesn't have a whole lot of those, except for the the display itself. The bezels look fat because of the curves and the overall look of the Nexus 10 look more like a toy and less like a technical tour de force. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_10_16gb">The Google Nexus 10 will be available Tuesday, November 13</a>.</p>
