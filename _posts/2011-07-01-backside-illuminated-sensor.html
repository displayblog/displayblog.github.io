<p><a href="http://www.cameratechnica.com/2011/06/23/technology-demystified-backside-illuminated-sensors/">Preston Scott</a> at Camera Technica:</p>
<blockquote><p>The advantages of backside illuminated sensors are clear.  The lack of obstruction allows for more efficient light collection for each pixel.  This means much better low light performance for the end user.  It also allows for smaller pixel dimensions while maintaining a given performance level.  Small camera phone sensors can now incorporate high pixel counts and render acceptable low light performance.</blockquote></p>
