<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/08/more-evidence-of-a-13-retina-macbook-pro-surfaces-as-benchmarks/">Jacqui Cheng, Ars Technica</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There may soon be a 13" version of Apple's new Retina MacBook Pro, at least if online benchmarks are to be believed. A machine <a href="http://browser.primatelabs.com/geekbench2/920438">purporting to be a 13" Retina MacBook Pro</a> recently appeared in the GeekBench online database&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the second of such benchmarks to make an appearance in the last month. This time, however, the machine claims to be running a seed of OS X 10.8.1, which Apple has not yet released to the public or its developer community.</blockquote></p>
<p>The 13.3-inch MacBook Pro sports a pixel format of 1280x800. A retina version would most likely be 2560x1600 with a 227 ppi resolution, higher than the 220-ppi <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2012/06/12/macbook-pro-with-retina-display/">15-inch MacBook Pro with retina display</a>.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.08.26:</em> <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57500548-37/13-inch-retina-macbook-pro-displays-in-production/">Brooke Crothers, CNET</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Production has begun of a 2,560-by-1,600 pixel density display that will land on a 13.3-inch MacBook Pro, NPD DisplaySearch analyst Richard Shim told CNET.</blockquote></p>
<p>Rumor has it LG Display, Samsung, and Sharp will supply the 227-ppi 13.3-inch LCD. Production levels are expected to be much higher: up to two million for the 13.3-inch retina MacBook Pro versus a few hundred thousand for the 15.4-inch retina MacBook Pro. Like the larger 15.4 inch I expect the 13.3-inch retina LCD will be IPS.</p>

<blockquote><p>While people accustomed to MacBook Airs probably think the 4.5-pound Retina is big and heavy, I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve found it to be noticeably thinner and lighter compared to the previous 15&acirc;&euro; MacBook Pro. It no longer feels like a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;big&acirc;&euro; laptop &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; few would argue if Apple just called it the 15&acirc;&euro; MacBook Air. Given this size reduction and the huge increase in power and usefulness over the MacBook Airs, I no longer wish that I was carrying a 13&acirc;&euro; Air instead: the Retina is small and light enough to alleviate that desire, especially knowing what I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m getting for the additional mass.</blockquote></p>
<p>For people who need a bit more oomph and a lot more display this might change with a 13.3-inch retina MacBook Pro.</p>
