<p>On May 2, 2008, <a href="http://www.digitalfoci.com">Digital Foci</a> announced that its Image Moments 8 digital photo frame is shipping, and just in time for Mother's Day. The Image Moments 8 digital photo frame has a 8" LCD (as the name suggests) but has something special in the back: a LED backlight! The LED backlight should help the Image Moments 8 consume a bit less power and will allow it to last a very long time. LEDs typically last about 100,000 hours, about twice that of CCFL. Another cool feature is the RAW image format support. Just plug in your high capacity CF or SD into the digital photo frame and you can view your RAW images right away.</p>
<p>For mothers whose children live far away, something like this for Mother's Day would be a great present, especially if you load it up with recent pictures of her children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>I can envision future digital photo frames that have advanced video features like the top LCD TVs of today: LED backlight, local dimming, LED progressive scanning, 120Hz, motion interpolation, etc. The future would definitely need to include HD or Full HD pixel formats for viewing home-made videos that are likely to have been shot in Full HD. And finally, how about a WiFi connection that can receive real-time updates from friends and family.</p>
