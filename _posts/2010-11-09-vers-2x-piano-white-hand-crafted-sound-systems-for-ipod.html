<p>Simply beautiful. There is also a bamboo version you might be interested in. <a href="http://versaudio.com/vers2xspec.htm">Vers</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since mature Bamboo is harvested by hand, there is far less energy 'invested' (and less CO2 produced) in processing Bamboo than wood or just about any other production material. Harder and more dimensionally stable than Oak, with strength characteristics equal to steel, you couldn't ask for a tougher, more environmentally thoughtful material.</blockquote></p>
