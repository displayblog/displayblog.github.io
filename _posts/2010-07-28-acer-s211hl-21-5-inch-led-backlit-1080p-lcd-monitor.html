<p>Acer has pumped out its S211HL, a 21.5-inch LCD monitor sporting a 1920x1080 pixel format and a LED backlight. A dynamic contrast ratio is spec'ed at 12,000,000:1, which is absolutely ridiculous. This stat doesn't matter at all. The stats that matter: 5ms response time, 250 cd/m2 of brightness, 8-bit color (16.7 million total available colors) and three connections: VGA, DVI, HDMI. There is the smaller S201HL (20 inch) and the larger S231HL (23 inch). The S231HL also sports a pixel format of 1920x1080 but why spend $50 more for the same number of pixels. The S211HL, the better value, is US$219.99. </p>
<p>The external design is simple and I like it, but I'm not liking the stand: what is it good for? Rotating? No. Height adjustment? No. Tilt maybe. <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/07/26/acer-debuts-s201hl-s211hl-and-s231hl-lcd-monitors/">Engadget</a></p>
