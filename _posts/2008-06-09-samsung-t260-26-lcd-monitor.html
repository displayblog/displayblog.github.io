<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=samsung">Samsung</a>'s T260 is a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=26"">26"</a> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-monitor">LCD monitor</a> with a pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a>. The T260 has the same number of pixels as the smaller <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/05/27/samsung-t240-24-lcd-monitor/">T240</a>. And that means that you'll get bigger fonts, icons, everything out of the box. You can get bigger stuff too on the T240 but you'll need to tinker with the DPI settings in Windows and even then things don't look quite right. The T260 has the Touch of Color design theme that makes it look really nice and even TV-like. Performance wise, the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dynamic-contrast">dynamic contrast</a> ratio of 20,000:1 should result in outstanding pictures while the 2ms (GTG) response times should get you going when playing some shoot 'em up games. With the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=hdmi">HDMI</a> connection you're also going to enjoy some HD content. The lack of viewing angle doesn't concern me too much as I think most people will be using the T260 on the desk and that means that they will be right in front of it watching whatever it has to display.</p>
