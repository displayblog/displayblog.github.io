<p>AU Optronics (AUO) and Chi Mei Optoelectronics (CMO) is expected to increase utilization rates in January to more than 90%. Because of fewer working days in February due to the Chinese New Year holiday, AUO and CMO will need to increase utilization rates to compensate production and meet demand. The Chinese New Year is celebrated not only in China but also in South Korea and other Asian countries. Although many workers at LCD manufacturers will not be working, due to the nature of how LCD fabs work, there will be workers there even during the holidays.</p>
