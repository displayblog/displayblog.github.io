<p>On May 22, Avnet announced an expanded relationship with LCD manufacturer, NEC. Avnet is the first distributor to target OEMs for NEC Display Solutions. Avnet's industrial OEMs will incorporate NEC displays into fully finished systems reducing design cycle times and getting the products to market faster. The target industrial markets are digital signage, gaming and medical devices. The bottomline is: NEC is distributing its industrial LCDs via Avnet to target OEM customers.</p>
