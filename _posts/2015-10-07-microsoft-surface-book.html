<p>[ <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/devices/surface-book">Microsoft</a> ] The Surface Book is a full-blown Wintel laptop and a full-blown Wintel tablet in one. And that dynamic fulcrum hinge!</p>
<p>[ <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/10/story-behind-surface-books-crazy-new-hinge/">Wired</a> ] Margaret Rhodes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The connective tissue between the Surface Book's base and display is an isopod-like piece of aluminum that flexes back and forth thanks to four rotational points.</blockquote><br />
Unlike the pixel formats found in the iPad Pro (2732x2048) and 12-inch MacBook (2304x1440), the 13.5-inch 10-point multitouch LCD sports a clean 3000x2000 pixel format. I like that Microsoft took the effort to make it a nice, even, round number.</p>
<p>The Surface Book's 267 ppi resolution is higher than the 13-inch retina MacBook Pro retina (227 ppi) and edges out the 12.9-inch iPad Pro (264 ppi).</p>
<p>Hardware isn't everything, of course, but Microsoft is without a doubt innovating where it matters.</p>
