<p>The 3.5" hTSP will be unveiled at SID 2006 in SF on Tuesday. The quarter-VGA or 320 x 240 pixel format display has a built-in touch screen that does not require a separate PCB on top of the LCD. Samsung integrated the sensor circuitry within the panel resulting in a much thinner touch-capable panel. Hopefully, this will lead to thinner PDAs and other mobile devices.</p>
