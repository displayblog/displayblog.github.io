<p><a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/03/05/apple_ships_over_1_million_macbook_airs_in_new_notebooks_first_quarter.html">AppleInsider</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Concord Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo tells AppleInsider that his most recent checks in Asia indicate Apple shipped a total of 1.1 million of its 11- and 13-inch MacBook Airs during the three-month period ending December, making the new breed of ultra-thin portables one of the company's most successful Mac product launches ever.</blockquote></p>
<p>And Apple is the one company eating up the netbook and ultra-portable notebook PC pies with its iPad. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/03/03/ipad-2-enthusiasm-growing/">My forecast of how well the iPad 2 will do</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Translation: net&Acirc;&shy;books, note&Acirc;&shy;books, lap&Acirc;&shy;tops, etc. for the home will get kicked in the nuts by the new iPad 2, and other tablets. With one excep&Acirc;&shy;tion: MacBooks.</blockquote></p>
