<p>There is something different going on in the world of LCD monitors right now. Previous to Samsung's CX223B/W 22" wide LCD monitor, every monitor starting from 20", whether it was 4x3 or 16:10, used a wide-viewing angle display technology such as In-Plane Switching (IPS) or Vertical Alignment (VA). With the advent of Samsung's CX223B/W, that is no more. As far as I know, Samsung's unit is a twisted-nematic (TN) mode with a wide viewing film. TN-mode displays are commonly found in smaller LCD monitors such as 15", 17", and 19", notebook PC displays and smaller LCD TV displays (<20"). TN-mode suffers in viewing angles but with a fairly inexpensive film, viewing angles can be enlarged to about 170 degrees left and right and about 150-160 degrees top to bottom, good for most applications. TN-mode also offers a lower cost of manufacturing. The 22" wide TN panel will most likely be cheaper to make than a comparable IPS or VA display at the same or even smaller size. That means you'll see 22" wide LCD monitors coming down to about $399 very soon, since Dell's 20" wide offering is already around $459, without coupons.</p>

<p>The CX223B/W is available in two colors: black and silver. The resolution is 1680 x 1050, a bit low relative to the size of the monitor. With just an additional inch, 1920 x 1200 resolution can be had. Of course, you will be paying a bit more, but with IPS or VA, viewing angles will be up to 178 degrees all around and there will be less color shifting at off-angle viewing--very important for design work. Response time is 5 ms and has a HDCP-enabled DVI port.</p>
