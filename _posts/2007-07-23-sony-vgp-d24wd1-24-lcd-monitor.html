Bland but simple. Sony and expensive. $1060 expensive, according to <a href="http://www.akihabaranews.com/en/news-14420-How%20to%20make%20a%20VAIO%20Type%20R%20happy.html">Akihabara</a> via <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/07/23/sony-intros-24-inch-vgp-d24wd1-monitor/">Engadget</a>. You can get the Samsung SyncMaster 245BW 24" <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-monitor">LCD monitor</a> for about half that price at <a href="http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;cs=19&amp;sku=A1162248">Dell.com</a> or opt for <a href="http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;cs=19&amp;sku=222-7315">Dell's 27" offering for about the same price</a>. So what's so special about Sony's VGP-D24WD1? The 1000:1 contrast ratio, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1200">1920 x 1200</a> pixel format, 400 cd/m2 brightness, 6ms response time and two HDCP-DVI ports are all fairly within the realm of normal. You could say that having two HDCP-DVI ports is somewhat special, but still they're DVI, not <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=hdmi">HDMI</a> or <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=displayport">DisplayPort</a>. In my opinion, the only thing special about Sony's really expensive 24" LCD monitor is the 92% NTSC color gamut that is the result of wide color gamut CCFLs (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=wcg-ccfl">WCG-CCFL</a>s). The only problem of having a wide color gamut is that it messes up folks (for a few minutes) that work extensively with color: the color on the screen versus what you expect to get via printer will look a little different than before, but in a good way since whatever is displayed on the monitor will actually look a bit closer to what you'll get printed out. I'm not one of those folks that work extensively with color and this is purely "theoretically speaking". Although I am a fan of Sony's industrial design, sometimes I wonder whether the premium price is worth it: in this case double the price of a very good Samsung? I try to maximize bang for my hard-earned buck, and this one makes me pause.</p>
