<p>I wonder why this is such a big deal. Maybe because South Korea's Samsung and LG.Philips LCD have been partying for too long without inviting the Japanese or the Taiwanese. Maybe. I have issues with making something like this a big deal. Of course, reporters and writers have to write about something so they bite into anything. Let's look at how many LCD manufacturers there are in these two countries:</p>
<p>Taiwan<br />
1. AUO<br />
2. CMO<br />
3. HannStar<br />
4. Quanta Display (will be eaten up by AUO)<br />
5. CPT<br />
6. Innolux</p>
<p>South Korea<br />
1. Samsung<br />
2. LG.Philips LCD</p>
<p>That's 6 to 2. It's actually surprising that South Korea has been able to maintain its lead over Taiwan with only two companies. I would say South Korea has the better model: more resources are focused into just two companies instead of six (or more?).</p>
