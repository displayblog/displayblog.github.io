<p>On June 29, 2007 I picked up the iPhone as a birthday present to myself. Since then I've upgraded to the iPhone 3G, 3GS, and 4. But five years later I find myself having returned to the original iPhone. Everything at your fingertips worked for a while, but access to everything is distracting. I wanted simple and found the original iPhone to be exactly what I wanted: a good-enough phone with texting capability.</p>

<p>Phone and Messages. Nice and simple. The rest are on the second screen. This setup keeps me from being easily distracted.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/06/29/iphone-turns-5-here-are-the-naysayers/">Jim Dalrymple, The Loop</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[...] I thought I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d take a different approach and look at some of the iPhone naysayers so we could make fun of them together.</blockquote></p>
<p>It might have been the magic of Steve Jobs, the simple and elegant industrial design, or the technical marvel of multitouch display technology. I'm sure it was all three, and I had to get it. After the keynote there was no doubt in my mind I had seen the next big thing. Millions of others did, too. But many really smart folks couldn't for some reason.</p>
<p>January 2007 when <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/sprague/archive/2007/01/18/java.aspx">Richard Sprague</a> was senior marketing director at Microsoft:</p>
<blockquote><p>I can't believe the hype being given to iPhone.&Acirc;&nbsp; Even some of my blindly-loyal pro-Microsoft friends and colleagues talk like it's a real innovation and will "redefine the market" or "usher in a new age".</p>
<p>What!?!?&Acirc;&nbsp; Without even mentioning that the same functionality has been available on PocketPC, Palm, Nokia, and Blackberry for years, I just have to wonder who will want one of these things (other than the religious faithful).&Acirc;&nbsp; People need this to be a <em>phone</em>, first and foremost. But with 5 hours of battery life?&Acirc;&nbsp; No keypad?&Acirc;&nbsp; (you try typing a phone number on that screen, no matter how wonderful it is -- you will want a keypad).&Acirc;&nbsp; And for all that whiz-bang Internet access, you absolutely need the phone to work, immediately, every single time.&Acirc;&nbsp; Will it do that?</p>
<p>So please mark this post and come back in two years to see the results of my prediction:&Acirc;&nbsp; I predict they will not sell anywhere near the 10M Jobs predicts for 2008.</blockquote></p>
<p>The iPhone redefined the smartphone. In January 2007 every phone manufacturer on the planet stopped what they were doing, went back to the drawing board, and copied Apple (except for a few companies like RIM). Indeed, a new age was born.</p>
<p>Who will want one of these things? <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120629/by-the-numbers-the-apple-iphone-five-years-later-infographic/">217 million people</a> all over the world. I wonder if Sprague uses one.</p>
<p>January 2007 Bloomberg columnist <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aRelVKWbMAv0&refer=home">Matthew Lynn</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The iPhone is nothing more than a luxury bauble that will appeal to a few gadget freaks. In terms of its impact on the industry, the iPhone is less relevant. [...] Apple will sell a few to its fans, but the iPhone won't make a long-term mark on the industry.</blockquote></p>
<p>I had to look up the word bauble: A small, showy trinket or decoration. Something of no importance or worth.</p>
<p>Harsh.</p>
<p>In August 2011 Lynn founded Strategy Economics: "[...] a new type of economic consultancy. Market-savvy, insightful and ahead-of-the-curve, it aims to deliver penetrating, original analysis of the big issues in the global markets."</p>
<p>Insightful?</p>
<p>How can such smart people get it so wrong? The answer: Getting it right has very little to do with how smart you are. Either your mind is open or it's closed. With an open mind you're giving yourself a chance to get it right. Not so with a closed mind.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs really did think different. He opened his mind to the possibility of something much better. And he worked himself and others tirelessly until the iPhone became a reality. The world is a better place for it.</p>
