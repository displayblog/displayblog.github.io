<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-3843 aligncenter" title="lg_x120" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/lg_x120.jpg" alt="lg_x120" width="500" height="369" /></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lg">LG</a> doesn't export its lovely notebook PCs or <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=netbook">netbook</a>s to the US. But maybe LG will since one of its most potent rival (that would be Samsung) has just started exporting to the largest market for portable computing, the US of A. LG was showcasing its X120 at CES 2009 and is a 10" netbook. The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=10"">10"</a> LCD sports a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1024-x-600">1024 x 600</a> pixel format, like most if not all other netbooks of this size. Intel's Atom running at 1.6GHz powers the X120. A cool feature is the LG Smart On, a Splashtop-powered instant on feature that is always welcome. I hope full-featured notebook PCs as well as desktop PCs adorn this must-have feature in the near future. Not that many specs but hopefully LG will decide not only to share all of the details but to share in the goodness and bring these cool gadgets across the Pacific.</p></p>
