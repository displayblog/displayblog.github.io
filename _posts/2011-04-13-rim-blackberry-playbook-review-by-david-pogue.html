<p>David Pogue at <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/14/technology/personaltech/14pogue.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1">The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p> Still, the PlayBook looks and feels great: hard rubberized back, brilliant, super-responsive multitouch screen, solid heft (0.9 pounds).</blockquote></p>
<p>The PlayBook's touch is "super-responsive". That's good to know because Android is still working on the super part of responsive.</p>
