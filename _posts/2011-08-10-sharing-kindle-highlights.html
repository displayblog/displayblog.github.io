<p><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/08/sharing-my-kindle-highlights.html">Fred Wilson</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was with my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/stevenbjohnson">Steven Johnson</a> yesterday and he told me about a trick that is a game changer for me and maybe you too. When you are reading on a Kindle (or a Kindle app), your highlights are sent to a private page at amazon.com. The address of my page (and yours too I imagine) is <a href="https://kindle.amazon.com/your_highlights">https://kindle.amazon.com/your_highlights</a>. If you have a kindle and do a lot of highlighting, go visit that page and you'll see all of your highlights.</blockquote></p>
