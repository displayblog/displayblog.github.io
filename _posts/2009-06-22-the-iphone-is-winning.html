<blockquote><p>Customers are voting and the iPhone is winning. With over 50,000 applications available from Apple's revolutionary App Store, iPhone momentum is stronger than ever.</blockquote><br />
That's from <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22steve+jobs%22&amp;sa=Search">Steve Jobs</a>, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=apple&amp;sa=Search">Apple</a>'s CEO. Welcome back Steve! Apple announced on June 22, 2009 that the company had sold more than one million iPhone 3GS models through Sunday, June 21, the third day after its launch. The iPhone 3GS is twice as fast as the iPhone 3G, has a longer battery life and a much improved camera that can also take video. It also has a lot more capacity: 16GB and 32GB--more than some netbooks out there. It took a lot longer for T-Mobile's G1 smartphone to get to the million mark--I believe it was around six months. Palm's Pre is considered to be a success, and I agree, but the numbers pale in comparison: <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2348369,00.asp">analysts put it at 100,000 unit sales</a>. I don't know the exact timeframe for those sales but I assume they were during the weekend that it launched. Apple's iPhone franchise is a winner and sales growth does not seem to be slowing down. Unfortunately, I will be waiting until June 2010 to get my next iPhone. Do you own an iPhone 3G? Are you getting the 3GS?</p>
