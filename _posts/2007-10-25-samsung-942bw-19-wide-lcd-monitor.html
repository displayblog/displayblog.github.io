The design is quite simple and boring. It is your typical 19" wide LCD monitor with the regular 1440 x 900 pixel format. The 5ms response time isn't that impressive. However there are some interesting features such as MagicBright3 that automatically optimizes brightness, contrast, and gamma. I wonder how it optimizes brightness unless it has some sort of light sensor. It probably doesn't, so that means it changes the brightness based on the image content, which could end up simply annoying the user. Another "feature" is the narrow bezel. I guess it's better than having a really thick bezel. Thin is in, whether it is the bezel or the depth. The price is decent at $250. Street prices according to <a href="http://computers.pricegrabber.com/flat-panel-lcd-monitors/m/49754719/search=Samsung+942BW/sort_type=price">PriceGrabber</a> seems to be around $225 as of this writing.</p>
