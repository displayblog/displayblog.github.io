<p style="text-align: left;">I wish I would have had the Eee Top when I was in college. Perhaps I would have done less gaming, and the memo application would have helped me to keep track of my assignments and projects.</p><br />

That's a quote from <a href="http://www.legitreviews.com/article/927/1/">Legit Reviews</a> regarding the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=ASUS&amp;sa=Search#1546">ASUS</a> Eee Top. The Eee Top is a touch-enabled all-in-one from ASUS. It features a 15.6" 16:9 aspect ratio sporting a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=1366+x+768&amp;sa=Search#1511">1366 x 768</a> pixel format. But don't let that HD-capable LCD fool you.</p>
<p><strong>DVD OK</strong> The integrated Intel GMA 950 isn't up to the task of playing back <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=720p&amp;sa=Search#1604">720p</a> HD content. Just stick with SD or VGA or 640 x 480 and you'll be fine. DVD playback should be good to go too.</p>
<p><strong>No Up &amp; Down</strong> Viewing at odd angles is a hit or miss occasion. Images can be easily viewed going left and right. But don't go up and down--you won't see much.</p>
<p><strong>Affordable</strong> The Eee Top is basically a touch-enabled netbook that's blossomed in size and looks. The all-in-one seems to work quite well for everyday practical applications, like the memo application for instance. The introduction price was $599.99 but <a href="http://affiliate.buy.com/gateway.aspx?adid=17662&amp;pid=3032127&amp;aid=10666313&amp;sURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Ebuy%2Ecom%2Fprod%2Fasus%2Deee%2Dtop%2Dall%2Din%2Done%2Dtouch%2Dscreen%2Dpc%2Dintel%2Datom%2Dn270%2D1%2D6%2Dghz%2D15%2D6%2Fq%2Floc%2F101%2F210743102%2Ehtml" target="_top"">Buy.com has it for just $499.95</a>. A mighty good deal if you ask me.</p>
