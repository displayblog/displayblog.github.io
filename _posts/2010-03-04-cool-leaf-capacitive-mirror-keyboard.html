<p>Dr. Kazuo Kawasaki, Design Diector at <a href="http://www.minebea.co.jp/english/press/2010/1185131_3999.html">Minebea Co.</a>, has developed something that tickles my high-tech design bone: a capacitive mirror keyboard. Well, it can be anything really: calculators, remotes, etc. As you can see from the picture above (there are more at Minebea) the surface is waterproof. But look closer: I love that retro font.</p>
<p>Minebea and Dr. Kawasaki incorporated a new film from Toray Industries to combine an "electrostatic capacity type touch panel and a load sensor," a first in the world. I'm not exactly sure what the load sensor does but it does not seem to be part of any haptic feedback mechanism since that is for future implementation. Maybe I am old school (I <em>am</em> old school) but I prefer a keyboard with physical buttons: the key-pushing sensation feels good to me.</p>
