<p><a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/115/open_next-design.html">Sir James Dyson</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We're taught to do things the right way. But if you want to discover something that other people haven't, you need to do things the wrong way. Initiate a failure by doing something that's very silly, unthinkable, naughty, dangerous. Watching why that fails can take you on a completely different path. It's exciting, actually.</blockquote></p>
