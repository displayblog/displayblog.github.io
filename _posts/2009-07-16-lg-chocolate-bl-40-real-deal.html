<p>Ah, so this is what the real thing looks like: <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=lg&amp;sa=Search#1459">LG</a>'s Black Label BL-40. Some say it is LG's next <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=chocolate&amp;sa=Search#1490">Chocolate</a> phone. The unique feature of the BL-40 is the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=21%3A9&amp;sa=Search#1490">21:9</a> ultrawide aspect ratio with a 800 x 345 resolution (landscape). The UI seems to be LG's S-Class with a 5 megapixel camera coupled with a Schneider Kreuznach lens. There is also WiFi and a FM transmitter so you can listen to your music in your car via FM radio. I hope there's a decently-powered media player that can playback ripped DVDs as the resolution is almost perfect for it. What I am curious about is whether or not the average user with average-sized hands can thumb-type in landscape mode with its ultrawide stance.</p>
