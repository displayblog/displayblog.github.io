<a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;langpair=vi%7Cen&amp;sl=ja&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://taoviet.vn/showthread.php%3Ft%3D16471">Taoviet</a> has taken hold of the next generation iPhone and tore it up. An Apple-branded processor is on deck, probably the same or similar one that's powering the iPad. This version is different than the one Gizmodo had: two screws on the bottom are gone. Looks a lot cleaner but no doubt it will be more difficult to open. This is interesting as previous generation iPhones have sported these two screws. But there are rumored stories of Steve Jobs' hatred for screws. I don't think we'll be too surprised at how the next generation iPhone will look like when Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/04/29/apple-wwdc-june-7-2010/">Apple WWDC: June 7, 2010</a></em>) comes around in June.</p>
