Dell is showcasing a prototype Studio XPS 16 integrated with an OLED display instead of the usual LCD. The 2-mm thick OLED sports a contrast ratio of 10,000:1, which is much much higher than any LCD in a notebook PC. The OLED also uses less power and is super fast with a response time that is just 0.004ms (great for gaming and watching fast-action movies) according to Dell.
