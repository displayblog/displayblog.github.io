<p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/2007-04-29-ballmer-ceo-forum-usat_N.htm?csp=34">Steve Ballmer</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There's no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share. No chance. It's a $500 subsidized item. They may make a lot of money. But if you actually take a look at the 1.3 billion phones that get sold, I'd prefer to have our software in 60% or 70% or 80% of them, than I would to have 2% or 3%, which is what Apple might get.</blockquote></p>
<p>Boy was he wrong.</p>
