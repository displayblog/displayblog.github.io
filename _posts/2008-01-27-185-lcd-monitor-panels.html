<p>Do you we need more sizes in the LCD monitor&Acirc;&nbsp;market? Well, yes, according to AU Optronics (AUO) and Chunghwa Picture Tubes (CPT), two Taiwan-based LCD manufacturers. This is in light of consumers just getting used to 17" wide LCD monitors. We saw 19" wide LCD monitors grab quite a bit of attention in 2007. CPT is slated to introduce 18.5" panels in 2H'08.</p>
<p>Why are they doing this? Well, they want to, sort of, fool the customer. And they should be very careful about this. With a 18.5" panel, you can technically go about stating that it is a 19" LCD monitor and in tiny letters say that the actual visible diagonal length is 18.5".</p>
<p>Monitor set manufacturers have tried&Acirc;&nbsp;to pass a 15" monitor as a 17" monitor in the past, in the days of CRT monitors.&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;But the courts decided that that was a big no-no and slapped them hard. That's why, if you remember, most CRT monitor boxes&Acirc;&nbsp;had two sizes on them: one for the diagonal size and another for the diagonal size that you can actually see.</p>
<p>There is a saying, "History repeats itself ." This is largely the result of us not being able to learn from our mistakes. And if CPT and AUO go with this plan,&Acirc;&nbsp;history certainly will repeat itself.</p>
