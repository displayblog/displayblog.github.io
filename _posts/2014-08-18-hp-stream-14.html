<p><a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/08/18/hello-hp-stream-14-a-199-windows-laptop-aimed-squarely-at-the-chromebook-market/">Gigaom</a>: The HP Stream 14 is a US$199 Windows 8.1 3.9-pound notebook. The price is right, but that's about as good as it gets:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 200-nit 14-inch SVA LCD sports a pixel format of 1366x768.</li>
<li>RAM is limited to single-channel 2GB DDR3L-1333MHz.</li>
<li>Storage is eMMC NAND flash: 32GB or 64GB</li>
<li>Powered by an AMD A4 Micro-6400T CPU.</li>
<li>Cloud storage: 100GB of OneDrive for two years</li><br />
</ul><br />
My biggest question: Can Windows 8.1 run smoothly?</p>
