<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2011/11/spot-on/">Ben Brooks</a>. <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/11/14/what-the-vaio-z-says-about-son.html">Rob Beschizza, Boing Boing</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>All of these were nice, high-end computers that could have become great designs if they'd stuck with them. But Sony rarely iterates, even when it's onto something good. Everything is a one-off.</blockquote></p>
<p>Taste versus design:</p>
<blockquote><p>Taste often describes flavors, appearances and forms; it blends into fashion, which spins as fast as people can spend their money. [...] Design, however, also concerns itself with function. If a design fails to encompass good taste, the result will be ugly. But if taste fails to encompass good design, it'll be useless.</blockquote></p>
<p>Beschizza concludes Apple cares very little about taste. I agree. Apple instead cares deeply about <a href="/2011/04/14/the-flip-was-good-design/">good design</a> and perpetually iterates it toward perfection. And that's the difference between Sony and Apple. Sony's designs exhibit long term memory loss; Apple remembers the good stuff, forgets the bad stuff, and keeps at it.</p>
