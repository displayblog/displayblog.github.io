These are some grand goals. To create a mock-up software application and make it into a video is one thing (e.g. <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/conde-hearst-news-corp-time-meredith-announce-big-digital-venture-2009-12">Wired's iTablet App</a>) but to actually develop a "common reading application" will take a miracle.

<p><strong>Adobe PDF. Zinio.</strong> I wonder if these companies have heard of PDF or Zinio, two very compelling publishing platforms. I'm sure there are others. I don't quite know what Zinio uses to generate its magazine formats but the end results are hyperlinked digital magazines that are a joy to read. Why reinvent the wheel? And to reinvent a wheel that is compatible with notebook PCs, desktops, netbooks, smartphones, etc. for Windows, Linux, OS X, etc. will be daunting to say the least, probably impossible for these guys. Have these five companies thought this through? Probably not. Did they rush to announce this deal? Probably. This independent venture smells of a defensive move to ward off Amazon and/or Apple. I do not know exactly what Apple has in store but <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250:8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID:11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=apple+tablet&amp;sa=Search">the tablet the company is rumored to be working on</a> will most likely be better than what these book publishers will be able to develop.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon. B&amp;N.com. Zinio.</strong> Yes, Zinio is here too because it does a very good job of selling and distributing digital magazine content. The five companies will go head-to-head with Amazon and B&amp;N.com? Oh boy. Good luck. And don't count out Google. If I was Google, I would tender an offer to purchase Zinio. Can you imagine the innovative advertising opportunities?
