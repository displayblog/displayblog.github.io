<p><a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/24/the-brain-on-love/?hp&pagewanted=all">Diane Ackerman, The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A relatively new field, called interpersonal neurobiology, draws its vigor from one of the great discoveries of our era: that the brain is constantly rewiring itself based on daily life. In the end, what we pay the most attention to defines us. How you choose to spend the irreplaceable hours of your life literally transforms you.</blockquote></p>
