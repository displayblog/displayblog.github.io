<blockquote><p>Our technology choices reflect our values. People willing to yield some control to Apple for their needs are more likely to enjoy the benefits that Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s products bring by exerting that control. But people who don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t like being told what to do &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; people who believe they know what&acirc;&euro;&trade;s best for them, want full control over everything, and are willing to accept the resulting responsibilities &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; will be more comfortable with the alternatives.</blockquote></p>
<p>I don't like being told what to do. I believe I know what's best for me, in terms of technology: hardware, software, and services. But I don't want full control over everything because I know full control is a lot of hassle.</p>
<p>I used to build my own computers. I took the time to research components such as motherboards, hard drives, power supplies, fans, optical drives, graphics cards, enclosures, etc. I'd research how to maximize air flow, minimize temperatures, maximize performance, and minimize component and system failures. I did all of that, got the parts, and spent the better part of a day and put the thing together. This monster of a machine would run Windows, of course, since building a hackintosh or a linux box has a lot of limitations.</p>
<p>The last Windows machine I built had two quad-core Xeons with push-pull fans attached to massive heatsinks, 16GB of RAM, four push-pull cooled 1TB 10,000 RPM enterprise hard drives, a powerful GPU, etc. all enclosed in a massive aluminum tower. I connected three 24-inch LCD monitors to it and boy was it fun. Until it lasted.</p>
<p>When that octa-core beast started hiccuping I realized total control wasn't worth the hassle. I did a 180 and purchased a fully-integrated notebook instead and ended up with what I have now: A mid-2009 17-inch MacBook Pro. The only thing I did was upgrade the hard drive to a SSD and I haven't had any problems since the MacBook arrived at my doorstep many years ago. And that's the way I like it.</p>
