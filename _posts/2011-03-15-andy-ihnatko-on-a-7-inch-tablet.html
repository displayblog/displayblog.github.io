<p><a href="http://www.suntimes.com/technology/ihnatko/4251092-452/ipad-2-release-spells-a-bleak-2011-for-other-tablet-makers.html">Andy Ihnatko</a> <em>via</em> John Gruber:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you try to build something the size of an iPad that tries to work kind of like an iPad, you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re pretty much admitting to your potential customers that Apple has The Real Thing and you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re selling a knockoff. One that costs $100 to $300 more, for some reason.</p>
<p>This is why I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m more optimistic about RIM&acirc;&euro;&trade;s PlayBook than any other non-iPad tablet on the immediate horizon. Steve Jobs railed against the futility of 7-inch tablets last year. RIM shrewdly took this as a sign that Apple isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t going to make something like that. As a result, the 7-inch PlayBook starts off with an immediate and clear answer to the question &acirc;&euro;&oelig;What makes this tablet different?&acirc;&euro;¬ù</blockquote></p>
<p>I guess Any Ihnatko completely forgot about the much ballyhoo'ed 7-inch Samsung Galaxy Tab that did little to dent the momentum of a larger less-portable 9.7-inch iPad. Given that, I don't think the 7-inch PlayBook has much of a chance, less even since the Galaxy Tab has thousands of Android apps.</p>
