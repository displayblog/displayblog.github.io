<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/12/08/dell-vostro-v13-hands-on-impressions-yes/">Engadget</a>: Cheaper materials, anodized aluminum exterior, great amount of stiffness, no bendy nonsense, antiglare LCD but not matte, bendy and clacky keyboard, no SD and ExpressCard/34 for $450, no Windows 7 for under $600. Still looks mighty tempting as your second take-anywhere notebook PC.</p>
