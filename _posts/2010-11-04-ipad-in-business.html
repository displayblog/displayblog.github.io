<p><a href="http://www.siliconrepublic.com/strategy/item/18692-ceos-urged-to-seize-ipad-op?">Silicon Republic</a>: Gartner Fellow and VP, Stephen Prentice:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is not usually the role of the CEO to get directly involved in specific technology device decisions, but Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s iPad is an exception.</p>
<p>It is more than just the latest consumer gadget; and CEOs and business leaders should initiate a dialogue with their CIOs about it if they have not already done so.</p>
<p>While some IT departments will say they are a &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Windows shop&acirc;&euro;&trade;, and Apple does not support the enterprise. Organisations need to recognise that there are soft benefits in a device of this type in the quest to improve recruitment and retention. Technology is not always about productivity.</p>
<p>While there are no certainties, the iPad looks set to become a market-disrupting device, like the iPod before it.</p>
<p>Even if you think it is just a passing fad, the cost of early action is low, while the price of delay may well be extremely high.</blockquote></p>
<p>But let's not take the word of just one man. During Apple's most recent earnings call here is an interesting tidbit: "More than 65% of Fortune 100 companies are already deploying or piloting the iPad, which only went on sale on April."</p>
<p>Steve Jobs:</p>
<blockquote><p>We haven't pushed it real hard in business, and it's being grabbed out of our hands.</p>
<p>I talk to people everyday in all kinds of businesses that are using iPads, all the way from Boards of Directors that are shipping iPads around instead of board books, down to nurses and doctors in hospitals and other large and small businesses.</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple has a section on its website titled "<a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/business/profiles/">iPad in Business</a>" and showcases a few examples (Hyatt Hotels, RehabCare, Dr. Ferencz, and charity:water) including some nifty videos.</p>
