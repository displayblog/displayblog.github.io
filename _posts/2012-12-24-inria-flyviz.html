<p>Evan Ackerman, <a href="http://dvice.com/archives/2012/12/flyviz-headset.php">DVICE</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The FlyVIZ headset may not make you stronger than a speeding bullet, or faster than a tall building, or able to leap locomotives in a single bound, but it <em>will</em> give you the superpower of being able to see all around you at once.</blockquote></p>
<p>The 360&deg; view is not intuitive, yet.</p>
