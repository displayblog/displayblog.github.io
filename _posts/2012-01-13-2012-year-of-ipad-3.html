<p><a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/01/13/snapshot-of-computer-market-with-and-without-the-ipad/">Deutsche Bank's Chris Whitmore</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>2011 was supposed to be the year of the Android tablet. One year later, Android tablets have failed to meet expectations and for the most part have been unsuccessful. This year, tablets had a much smaller presence as vendors appear to be placing greater emphasis on Windows 8. We expect Windows 8 ARM tablets to ramps slowly as most Apps require rewriting for ARM-based tablet hardware. We remain skeptical that Win 8 tablets will gain much traction this year (App rewrites take time / developer ecosystem support). As a result, we expect the move away from Android tablet investment and a slow ramp of Win 8 tablets to create a favorable competitive backdrop for Apple's forthcoming iPad 3.</blockquote></p>
