<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Five-row slide-out QWERTY keyboard with a dedicated row for numbers.</li>
<li>The camera is 8 megapixels with a LED flash.</li>
<li>Video capture is at 1080p HD.</li>
<li>A mini-HDMI port is on the left.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p><em>Update:</em> The YouTube-hosted videos that were originally embedded probably did a lot to get the word out that the Motorola Droid 3 is around the corner. Motorola Mobility didn't like that so the videos are no longer there.</p>
