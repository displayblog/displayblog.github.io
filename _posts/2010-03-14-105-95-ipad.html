<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/support/ipad/service/battery/">Apple</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If your iPad requires service due to the battery's diminished ability to hold an electrical charge, Apple will replace your iPad for a service fee.</blockquote><br />
The service fee including shipping is US$105.95. Nice.</p>
