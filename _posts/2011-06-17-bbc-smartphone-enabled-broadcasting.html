<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/journalism/blog/2011/06/the-truth-about-the-bbcs-iphon.shtml">BBC College of Journalism Blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you can broadcast or file from wherever you are without wasting time setting up equipment, then that transforms how you do news. You can develop new angles on a story, create a truly interactive relationship with audiences, fact-check political claims, and provide a stream of updates from where a story is happening rather than from where you can put a satellite truck.</blockquote></p>
