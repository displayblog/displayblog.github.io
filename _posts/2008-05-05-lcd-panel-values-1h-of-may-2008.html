<p>In the first half of May, all LCD monitor panels and notebook PC LCD panels that are both tracked by DisplaySearch and Witsview have experienced M/M increases. On the other hand, LCD TV panel prices all fell.</p>
<p>For the first half of May 2008, here are the top three values by application in terms of $/MP:</p>
<ol>
<strong>LCD monitor panel</strong></p>
<li>20" 1680 x 1050 at 81.07 $/MP (previous month 79.93 $/MP)<br />
</li>
<li>22" 1680 x 1050 at 90.70 $/MP (89.57 $/MP)<br />
</li>
<li>17" 1280 x 1024 at 93.46 $/MP (92.70 $/MP)<br />
</li></ol><br />
20" 1680 x 1050 continued to be the best value in LCD monitor panels at just 81.07 $/MP, which was a slight increase from 79.93 $/MP last month.</p>
<ol>
<strong>NBPC panel</strong></p>
<li>17.0" 1440 x 900 at 94.14 $/MP (93.75 $/MP)</li>
<li>14.1" 1280 x 800 at 94.73 $/MP (93.26 $/MP)</li>
<li>15.4" 1280 x 800 at 97.66 $/MP (96.68 $/MP)</li><br />
</ol><br />
17.0" 1440 x 900 overtook 14.1" 1280 x 800 for the best value in notebook PC LCD panels as 14.1" 1280 x 800 panel prices increased $1.50 while 17.0" 1440 x 900 increased just $0.50.</p>
<ol>
<strong>LCD TV panel</strong></p>
<li>26" 1366 x 768 at 221.62 $/MP (224.48 $/MP)<br />
</li>
<li>32" 1366 x 768 at 304.07 $/MP (310.75 $/MP)<br />
</li>
<li>37" 1366 x 768 at 407.50 $/MP (413.22 $/MP)<br />
</li></ol><br />
The results for LCD TV panels are fairly straightforward because all three have the same number of pixels. Unfortunately, 1080p LCD TV panel prices were not publicly available from both market research companies. DisplaySearch did post a $735 (down $15) price on a 46" 1080p LCD TV panel that puts the value at 354.46 $/MP (361.69 $/MP), a much better value than 37".</p>
<p>Note: For those who purchase LCD panels, this set of information might be interesting. I took publicly available pricing information for LCD panels from Witsview and DisplaySearch, took the average, and then did some analysis on maximum value.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this blog post, maximum value is defined as dollar per megapixel ($/MP, lower is better). What this value shows is how many pixels you are getting for each dollar. Many might say that overall diagonal size is a much more important indicator and that might be true. But given the same size, I prefer a higher resolution LCD leading me to conclude that I value the number of pixels.</p>
<p>The value of pixels can be seen clearly in the trend toward 1080p in LCD TVs. Given the same size, say 42", most consumers will desire a 1080p model compared to a 720p. The recent trend toward 1080p 32" LCD TVs is another case in point.</p>
