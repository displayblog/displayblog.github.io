<p>Finally. I like it. Can't wait for a final release. John Gruber (<a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/12/08/chrome-for-mac">Daring Fireball</a>) laments:</p>
<blockquote><p>... I can't stand how the close button for tabs is on the right. On the Mac, close goes on the left.</blockquote><br />
Well, close goes on the left, of Mac <em>windows</em>. FireFox also seems to be okay with the close button on the right for tabs. I personally don't mind since I haven't used Safari in a while.</p>
