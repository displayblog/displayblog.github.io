<p>Samsung is moving toward single-sided edge-lit LED backlight technology and is requesting larger 30x40-mm LED chips, which are to be integrated into LED backlight units at the end of August or in early September. The single-sided LED backlight technology will require less LED chips and will allow for cheaper LCD TVs with LED BLUs.
