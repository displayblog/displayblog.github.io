<p>Dustin Sklavos, <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6519/hp-elitebook-8570w-notebook-review-the-other-side-of-the-coin/5">AnandTech</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The HP EliteBook 8570w is capable of being outfitted with a 10-bit IPS display that HP dubs DreamColor, and the high color gamut can be a sight to behold. On top of that, we're looking at a 1920x1080 display in a 15.6" form factor, a pixel density much appreciated in notebooks. It appears that LG Philips is manufacturing the majority of these high end panels that are being used, as Dell's Precision M6700's PremierColor display is also using one of their panels.</blockquote></p>
<p>The HP EliteBook 8570w sports a matte LCD with a RGB LED backlight. The RGB LEDs are what enables the fantastically high color gamut. With higher precision binning of RGB LEDs HP could have more accurately matched RGB wavelengths in the color filter resulting in color accuracy equal to or better than the 8760w.</p>
<p>Display specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contrast: 738:1</li>
<li>Brightness (white): 251 nits</li>
<li>Brightness (black): 0.34 nits</li>
<li>Delta E: 1.52</li>
<li>Color Gamut: 96.4% AdobeRGB 1998</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Contrast is decent, but the Clevo P170EM, Samsung Series 7, and Dell Precision M6700 all have better. White brightness is lowest among the six notebooks compared, but black brightness comes in third behind the Clevo and Samsung. Color accuracy (Delta E) isn't great, but competent. Where the HP EliteBook 8570w shines is its color gamut. But what good is wide color gamut when color accuracy isn't there? For color professionals the higher end EliteBook 8760w is a better choice: You get a slightly broader color gamut and better color accuracy. And about that 10-bit IPS LCD: I wonder if it isn't 8-bit plus FRC.</p>
<p>The HP EliteBook 8570w sports one of the best LCDs you can find in a notebook PC, but it is thick, heavy, and ugly. Add to that a hefty price and I'm beginning to wonder if the fantastic LCD is worth it. There is one more major letdown: 1920x1080. I much prefer <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2012/06/12/macbook-pro-with-retina-display/">2880x1800, thin, light, and sexy</a>.</p>
