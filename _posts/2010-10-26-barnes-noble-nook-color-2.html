<blockquote><p>Our spectacular 7-inch VividView&acirc;&bdquo;&cent; Color Touchscreen makes reading more engaging than ever. The backlit screen makes it easy to read day or night. Displaying more than 16 million colors in unsurpassed high-resolution, NOOKcolor delivers incredibly rich images and clear, crisp text, making your reading come to life in ways you've never experienced before.</blockquote></p>
<p>Barnes & Noble isn't kidding around when it states the Nook Color has "Best-In-Class Display Technology." This here 7-inch LCD is of the IPS variety, the exact same technology used in the iPhone 4's Retina Display and the iPad.</p>
<p>Viewing angles are as expected: 178/178. Sixteen million colors will make sure magazines will look as good as the real thing. Unlike the E Ink-based Nook you can read at night, with the lights off.</p>
<p>The pixel format is 1024x600, just like you see on the Samsung Galaxy Tab, resulting in a resolution of 169 PPI. Not class-leading but should be good enough for most.</p>
<p>With WiFi off the Nook Color lasts eight hours. There are some goodies included: Pandora, chess, sudoku, crossword puzzles and a media gallery for photos and videos. Priced at US$249; will start shipping on November 19th.</p>
