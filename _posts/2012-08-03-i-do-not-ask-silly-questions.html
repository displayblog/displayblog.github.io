<p><a href="http://techpinions.com/put-a-fork-in-the-tablet-controversy/8165">John Kirk, Tech.pinions</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I do not ask silly questions, like whether a tablet is a consumption device. I do not ask whether a phone or a tablet does &acirc;&euro;&oelig;real&acirc;&euro;¬ù work. I do not obsess on the exceptionally rare times when I may use my phone as a tablet, my tablet as a notebook or my notebook as a tablet. Instead, I simply use the right tool at the right time.</blockquote></p>
