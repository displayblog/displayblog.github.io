<p>Chunghwa Picture Tubes (CPT) announced its April 2008 shipment results and the picture isn't all that great. Large-size TFT LCD panel shipments were sequentially unchanged at 2.349 million units but the consolidated revenue generated from those shipments were down 8.5% M/M from NT$13.345 billion to NT$12.281 billion. On a Y/Y basis, consolidated sales were up 13.1%. Although recent prices for IT panels (LCD monitor, notebook PC) have been on the rise, LCD TV panel ASPs have been tumbling. A large exposure to LCD TV panels would have a negative effect on revenues.</p>
<p>Small/medium TFT LCD shipments increased 3.3% M/M to 4.3 million units in April. CPT also manufactures cathode ray tubes (CRTs) and shipments declined 1.3% M/M to 1.7 million while consolidated revenues were down 6.6% M/M to NT$1.28 billion. For 2008, CPT is expecting 19.2 million LCD monitor panels, 6.8 million notebook PC panels and 2.7 million LCD TV panels.</p>
