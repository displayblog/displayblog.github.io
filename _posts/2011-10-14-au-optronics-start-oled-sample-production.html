<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20111013PD214.html">DigiTimes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Viewing that AMOLED has become an increasingly important trend in panel technological development, AUO has therefore resumed development.</blockquote></p>
<p>AU Optronics (AUO) is currently manufacturing small/medium OLED* samples with volume production planned for in 2012. But China-based competition is fierce: BOE, Irico, Sichuan CCD Display Technology, Visionox, Xiamen Tianma Micro-Electronics. And there's the 600-pound gorilla: Samsung.</p>
<p>&mdash;</p>
<p>* AMOLED refers to active matrix OLED, and using the term AMOLED is like saying AMLCD instead of LCD. So I just use OLED.</p>
