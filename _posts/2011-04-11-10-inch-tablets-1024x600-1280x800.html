<blockquote><p>The sources pointed out that 10-inch 1,024x600 panels currently cost about US$37, while 10-inch 1,280x800 panels cost about US$65-70. Motorola's Xoom is currently using panels with a resolution of 1,280x800 to achieve a stronger image output.</blockquote></p>
<p>To compete with the iPad, which has a 1024x768 pixel format, other brands are moving toward more pixels from 1024x600 to 1280x800, naturally costing more. But I'm surprised that it could cost up to twice as much for only 67% more pixels.</p>
