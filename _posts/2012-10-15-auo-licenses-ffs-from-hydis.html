<p><a href="http://auo.com/?sn=107&lang=en-US&c=&n=1452">AUO</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The patent cross-license agreements primarily involve LCD related technologies, including the wide viewing angle Fringe Field Switching (FFS) technology with applications to smartphones and tablets, which will facilitate technological development of innovative electronic products.</blockquote></p>
<p>Want to become a display supplier to Apple's iPod touch, iPhone, or iPad programs? You'll need FFS, IPS, PLS or some other wide viewing angle technology that's just as good. I think AUO wants in.</p>
