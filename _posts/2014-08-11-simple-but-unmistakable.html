<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/technology/-inside-apples-internal-training-program-.html?_r=0&pagewanted=all">Brian X. Chen, The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a version of the class taught last year, Mr. Nelson showed a slide of &acirc;&euro;&oelig;The Bull,&acirc;&euro; a series of 11 lithographs of a bull that Picasso created over about a month, starting in late 1945. In the early stages, the bull has a snout, shoulder shanks and hooves, but over the iterations, those details vanish. The last image is a curvy stick figure that is still unmistakably a bull.</blockquote></p>
<p>The class is &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Communicating at Apple&acirc;&euro; and taught at Apple University. Here's a link to <a href="http://switchyardcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/tumblr_lvicm7zgDK1r2izabo1_1280.jpg">the 11 lithographs of Picasso's bull</a>.</p>
