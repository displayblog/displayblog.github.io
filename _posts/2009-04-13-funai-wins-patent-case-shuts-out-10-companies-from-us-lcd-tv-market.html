In 2007, Funai complained to the US International Trade Commission that 14 companies had violated its patent for technology that allows the reception of digital broadcasts. The patent was acquired from Thomson, a French company, in 2007 prior to the filing the patent infringement case. <a href="http://www.google.com/custom?hl=en&amp;safe=active&amp;client=pub-1028052232505250&amp;channel=0117441043&amp;cof=FORID%3A13%3BAH%3Aleft%3BS%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.displayblog.com%3BCX%3ADisplayBlog%2520Search%2520Engine%3BL%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.displayblog.com%2Fwp-content%2Fthemes%2FProSense-Grey%2Fimages%2Fdisplayblog_logo_03_thin.jpg%3BLH%3A50%3BLC%3A%230000ff%3BVLC%3A%23663399%3BGFNT%3A%230000ff%3BGIMP%3A%230000ff%3BDIV%3A%23336699%3B&amp;adkw=AELymgXLpu9fV8INrOSligzhlW7dZnXQj_wCbQZpZ-eQMyC9MVMJsYOphNLC88rVPi46EiQn8JPPxznQYQ2aBkEp4oWVMoshJN5BWdmCNHqu11elhFNhzIjto8_mbCATGK44y9vsyQ_IYWJ0J5AB858N-RB_IcaBxpfvf6EDdndpT9kXNDwjCDxPSfqqlEIr7-eRXCaLoCxJzjNzABiXsIe2KVST_20h0w&amp;boostcse=0&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;oe=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=vizio&amp;btnG=Search&amp;cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3Autpr0mvi0e9">Vizio</a> and an additional 10 companies must stop importing and marketing LCD TVs that infringe Funai's patent. The 10 companies include TPV Technology and they have 60 days to stop importing the TVs.</p>
<p>Morrison &amp; Foerster's Karl Kramer, lead lawyer for Funai defended the company's '369 and '07 patents. One of the arguments against Funai was that the company was not licensing its patents at a reasonable and nondiscriminatory rate as is required with industry standards. Kramer countered that Vizio was not willing to pay at all. President Obama is allowed to review the decision within the 60 days.</p>
