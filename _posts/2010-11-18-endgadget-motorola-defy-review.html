<blockquote><p>The display is, as you'd probably expect, fashioned from Gorilla Glass -- so it should hold up admirably against your careless (and non-malicious) handling. [...] It's got good feel and good tactile response; we never found ourselves in a situation where we felt like the screen had missed a tap. Like many of Motorola's other Android devices, the Defy doesn't feature any fancy screen tech like IPS, SLCD, or AMOLED, so although it looks great straight-on, it starts to wash out about 30 degrees off-center in any direction. [...] Perhaps more importantly, we found that the screen stays readable outdoors, which is more than we can say for many AMOLED components.</blockquote></p>
<p>For Android-loving folks with butterfingers the Motorola Defy seems to be it. And the 3.7-inch 854x480 ain't that bad either. The Defy sports a 5 megapixel camera and records video in 640x480 at 30fps. Note: Water resistant, not waterproof. And it is running 2.1 with MOTOBLUR.</p>
