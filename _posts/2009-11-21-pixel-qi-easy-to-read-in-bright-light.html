<p>We've seen <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/06/03/pixel-qi-3qi-display-video-at-computex/">Pixel Qi's LCD perform quite well in direct sunlight</a>. Mary Lou Jepsen <a href="http://pixelqi.com/blog1/2009/11/21/most-screens-hard-to-read-on-bright-office-light/">snapped a photo</a> showing how well Pixel Qi's screen does inside an office. Regular glare-type and matte-type LCDs don't look like they did as well. Mary Lou Jepsen also <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mm8WoItVRn0&amp;annotation_id=annotation_565034&amp;feature=iv">answers some questions in a video interview</a>.
