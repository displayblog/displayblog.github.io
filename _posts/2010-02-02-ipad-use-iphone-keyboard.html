<p>The Russians Used A Pencil's Dan Provost in&Acirc;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.therussiansusedapencil.com/post/364510320/typing-on-the-ipad"><em>Typing on the iPad</em></a> suggests a solution to a problem on the iPad. In portrait mode, the iPad's keyboard is too small to type with both hands and too large to thumb type. Dan's idea is clever:</p>
<blockquote><p>Scale the keyboard down so it's about the size of the iPhone keyboard in landscape mode, and then split into two halves.</blockquote><br />
Most of the pictures of an iPad in portrait mode are leaning against your legs. Why? Apple shows the iPad user using two hands to type. I don't think that can be a long term solution as it would be quite uncomfortable and awkward. All smartphone users are used to thumb typing so leveraging our experience (and habit) by applying a thumb-typable keyboard to an iPad is an excellent idea. No longer will we need to use our legs to type. A winner. <em>via</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/02/02/provost-ipad-typing">Daring Fireball</a></p>
