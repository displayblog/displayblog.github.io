<p><a href="http://www.bgr.com/2010/11/08/samsung-galaxy-tab-impressions/">Boy Genius Report</a> impression on the Samsung Galaxy Tab's 7-inch LCD:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s CEO &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; who will remain nameless &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; publicly stated that a 7-inch screen was too small for a tablet, and after using the Tab, we tend to agree. Just using the device for the last few days proved to be very difficult from a size perspective. Seven inches of display on a tablet, for us, feels pretty odd and makes using the device pretty uncomfortable. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a very weird in-between feeling; we can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t decide [if] it feels like a smartphone that is too big or a tablet that is too small.</blockquote></p>
<p>Too big or too small. Not good.</p>
