<blockquote><p>We also enjoyed using the screen on the Atrix 2. First, while both Atrix devices (Atrices?) take advantage of qHD displays with 960 x 540 resolution, the newer one looks better despite having a larger display to hold the same number of pixels in. This is mainly because HelloMoto opted not to use the Pentile matrix scheme, which is something that the company has elected to do on most of its qHD screens -- including the first Atrix and the Droid Bionic.</blockquote></p>
<p>The first Atrix had a 4.0-inch LCD with PenTile Matrix; the Atrix 2 has a 4.3-inch LCD with RGB.</p>
