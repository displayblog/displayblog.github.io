<p><a href="http://mediacenter.motorola.com/Press-Releases/Motorola-Mobility-Unveils-the-New-Motorola-RAZR-Impossibly-Thin-Meets-Head-turning-Innovation-3867.aspx">Motorola</a>: 4.3-inch Super AMOLED Advanced with 960x540. Yet another Super AMOLED variety. Likely a RGBW or RGBG PenTile Matrix sub-pixel structure. Motorola focuses on video playback, and rightly so. Compared to the iPhone 4/4S it has a larger display but less pixels. And about that 7.1-mm thinness: How thick is the fat part?</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/5198/motorola-droid-razr-review-a-better-clad-bionic/4">Brian Klug, AnandTech</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The thing that gets left out of most discussions about the RAZR&acirc;&euro;&trade;s display is that although RGBG is used, the subpixels have a different geometry than their RGBG first and second generation (AMOLED and Super AMOLED) partners from Samsung. Previously, green subpixels were noticeably thinner than their R and B partners. In this new matrix, they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re much closer to being same size (this also applies to the Galaxy Nexus and any of the new Samsung AMOLED panels that don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t use RGB stripes).</p>
<p>With respect to the RAZR, the combination of this more uniform subpixel geometry and higher effective resolution (qHD) at 4.3&acirc;&euro;¬ù makes RGBG PenTile nowhere near as visually noticeable as it was on phones like Galaxy S. I originally tweeted that I found the RAZR display visually different than other AMOLED panels with RGBG, and this is what I was referring to. Subjectively I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d even say that the RAZR has less characteristic PenTile grain than the RGBW LCD variants I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve seen recently.</blockquote></p>
<p>PenTile Matrix, but with less of the disadvantages. Color accuracy is still an issue, time will tell whether it will be less of one.</p>
