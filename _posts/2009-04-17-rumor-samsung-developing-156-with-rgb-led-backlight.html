<p>What's the big deal with a <a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3Autpr0mvi0e9&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=rgb+led+backlight&amp;sa=Search">RGB LED backlight</a>? Let me answer that for you. RGB LED backlight improves on the regular LED backlight that makes use of white LEDs. The improvement is in color. The color gamut improves significantly to 100% NTSC or more. White LED backlights generate about 72% NTSC at best. So color is definitely improved.</p>
<p>The other important point is that the rumor is Samsung is developing a <a href="http://www.google.com/custom?hl=en&amp;safe=active&amp;client=pub-1028052232505250&amp;channel=0117441043&amp;cof=FORID%3A13%3BAH%3Aleft%3BS%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.displayblog.com%3BCX%3ADisplayBlog%2520Search%2520Engine%3BL%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.displayblog.com%2Fwp-content%2Fthemes%2FProSense-Grey%2Fimages%2Fdisplayblog_logo_03_thin.jpg%3BLH%3A50%3BLC%3A%230000ff%3BVLC%3A%23663399%3BGFNT%3A%230000ff%3BGIMP%3A%230000ff%3BDIV%3A%23336699%3B&amp;adkw=AELymgW0l7PPr9idElqD8qCb3YwMRTQQddeO2lXmeGR0o_8qVj-g-0q57TLb4nuzYl3MxFdMAAB_WReE9ewbVqDyKSe0ivtCQ16yuopPmvtkRIGI7D2LLSeaQ5Z_xhomMCVdQNesG-mbQNzlt695rPb-hBKvNBCtGV6v4ihrBf3uMVnMX5VNnvgICu6Z4rVivTmKy2aDypclWJuilI5OSvLN7aXs6mHKdA&amp;boostcse=0&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;oe=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=15.6%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3Autpr0mvi0e9">15.6"</a> TFT LCD panel with RGB LED backlight. What that means is that you get great color on a notebook PC. Folks that need color precision on their notebooks should rejoice since most likely this rumor, if true, will lead to more choice and lower prices of notebook PCs with great LCDs.</p>
