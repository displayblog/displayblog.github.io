<p>Andy Rubin as quoted on <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20111019/android-chief-says-your-phone-should-not-be-your-assistant/">AllThingsD</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don't believe that your phone should be an assistant. Your phone is a tool for communicating. You shouldn't be communicating with the phone; you should be communicating with somebody on the other side of the phone.</blockquote></p>
<p>Alexander Graham Bell would agree.</p>
