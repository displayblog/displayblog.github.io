<p>On October 29th, Sharp is planning to unveil a 330-inch digital signage display at Tokyo Station. The massive screen is composed of eighteen 60-inch displays. Each of these 60 inchers sport a pixel format of 1366x768. This is definitely huge. I wonder what it would be used for? Massive advertisements?
