<p>[ <a href="http://press.ihs.com/press-release/tv-shipments-decline-even-4k-tv-continues-strong-growth-ihs-says">IHS</a> ]</p>
<blockquote><p>The abrupt weakening of global demand for TV sets, combined with continued LCD capacity expansion, caused an oversupply in the market in the second half of 2015. This shift to oversupply has resulted in extremely steep LCD TV panel price declines, but it has been difficult to pass the savings along to consumers, as inflation and currency depreciation in emerging markets have offset the cost reduction. As a result, total annual TV shipments fell to 226 million units in 2015, a 4 percent year-over-year decline [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>I think a lot of us are waiting for 4K TVs, to be cheap, US$499 for a 55-inch cheap. We are almost there.</p>
<p>According to IHS, 4K TV shipments grew 173% Y/Y to 32 million units in 2015; that's 14% of the overall TV market. The most likely reason 4K TV shipments rose is because 4K is still the new thing and prices fell 30% Y/Y.</p>
<p>I expect 4K TVs prices to continue falling. I don't know exactly when but 55-inch 4K TVs by the major brands -- VIZIO, Samsung, LG, etc. -- will hit $499 this year. Black Friday 2016 might be a good time to upgrade to a 4K TV.</p>
<p>Note: If you have a lot more money than time you might want to check out 4K OLED TVs, which are 4x more expensive than 4K LCD TVs, but also 4x cooler. If you're ever at Best Buy or Fry's Electronics -- or whichever store sells nice TVs in your neighborhood -- focus on how deep the blacks are. Prices should fall to about $2000 for a 55-inch by the end of this year. These price predictions are absolutely <em>not</em> based on big data machine learning algorithmic analytics, just my gut.</p>
