<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/13/5096680/motorola-moto-g-announced-price-availability">The Verge</a>: The Motorola Moto G is almost identical to the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2013/08/05/motorola-moto-x/">Moto X</a>, but sports a 4.5-inch LCD with a pixel format of 1280x720. The biggest thing about the Moto G is its rock bottom price: US$179, unlocked and sans contract. I wonder if Motorola is making any money on this.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/11/26/moto-g-review/">Jamie Rigg, Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Screen resolution often takes a hit in the name of cost savings, but not so on the Moto G. A respectable 720p resolution is spread lovingly across the 4.5-inch LCD display, working out to a screen density of 329 pixels per inch. Numbers aren't everything, though. What's the point of all those pixels if they're dull and off-tone? Fortunately, we don't have any such gripes with the Moto G's screen. Colors are intense; whites are white; and blacks are, well, actually black -- we had to double-check the spec sheet to make sure we hadn't misread AMOLED for LCD.</blockquote></p>
<p>That 329 ppi number is actually quite good; beats the iPhone 5, 5c, and 5s by a hair. I'm impressed blacks are so black.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/2/5156546/moto-g-review">Aaron Souppouris, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Although outdone by more expensive, higher-resolution displays, the Moto G's 4.5-inch 720p LCD panel is in a class of its own at this price. A bright panel with accurate colors and solid viewing angles, there's really not much more I could ask from a budget smartphone. In fact, the display is easily on par with those found on last year&acirc;&euro;&trade;s flagships, such as the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/2/2919202/htc-one-x-review">HTC One X</a>. It's certainly a huge step up from the low-resolution displays offered by the competition.</p>
<p>Nokia's cheap Lumia and Asha phones, Samsung's lesser Galaxy smartphones, and LG&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Optimus F range all offer WVGA (800 x 480) displays. Some Samsung phones, like the Galaxy Fame, step that down further to HVGA (480 x 320). Of course, resolution isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t the only defining aspect of a display, but the difference between WVGA and 720p is immediately noticeable. That Motorola has managed to put this display into a phone costing so little is an achievement in itself.</blockquote></p>
<p>Motorola claims it is making a profit on the Moto G at just $179. I am impressed, especially because the LCD is large-ish at 4.5 inches and according to the few reviews I've read it is of very good quality. Can we expect several quite usable low- to mid-end smartphones in the near future to hit a full price of $149 or even $99? That will do a number on smartphone penetration in developing countries. Speaking of which...</p>
<p>Without LTE, and the incredibly low price, Motorola is clearly targeting developing countries with the Moto G. Countries with advanced wireless infrastructure &mdash; South Korea and Japan for instance &mdash; are planning to shut down 3G as they move aggressively toward LTE. No one will touch the Moto G in these countries, but I see huge potential for the Moto G in the U.S.</p>
<p>The four major carriers &mdash; AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon Wireless &mdash; will need more time &mdash; maybe up to two years? &mdash; to completely cover the U.S. with LTE. And even then it will take additional years to decide and implement the shutting down of 3G service. So my guess is: 3G in the U.S. is here to stay for a while.</p>
<p>Add to this the understanding that a lot of Android smartphone users use it as a basic phone, and price is probably the most important factor to this demographic. Pair the full price of only $179 with a month-to-month voice-only service and I can see the Moto G being a popular choice for many who would rather not deal with all the bells and whistles, a two-year contract, and the cost.</p>
