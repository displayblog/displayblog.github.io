<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/02/23/hugo-blu-ray-3d-special-feature-scorsese/">Martin Scorsese</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We see in 3D, we see in space... most of us do. Space is part of our lives. It means something. I think, for the individual person who has a vision of telling a story through images, how that person uses space&mdash;that extra element, that extra dimension&mdash;to tell a story is very, very important.</blockquote></p>
<p>Don't trick my eyes, instead give me a real third dimension like the real world.</p>
