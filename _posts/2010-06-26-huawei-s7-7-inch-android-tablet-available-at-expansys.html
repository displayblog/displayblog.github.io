<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-11377 aligncenter" title="Huawei_S7_7inch_800x480_Android_Snapdragon_Tablet" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Huawei_S7_7inch_800x480_Android_Snapdragon_Tablet.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="281" /></p><br />
Huawei's S7 tablet is a Snapdragon-powered Android tablet running Eclair (Android 2.1). The display is a 7-inch 800x480 LCD and the Snapdragon is breathing at a 768MHz clip. That most likely means elements of Android will be not as snappy as you'd want since we've seen 1GHz Snapdragon-powered Eclair smartphones exhibit a bit of choke here and there. The S7 features 3G, WiFi, a 2 megapixel camera, a microSD slot, and goes for &Acirc;&pound;299 and with current exchange rates is about US$450 but the US price is just $354.99, a good deal. The Huawei S7 is for the time being only available at <a href="http://www.expansys.com/d.aspx?i=199911">Expansys</a>. Discounts are available for orders of five or more: call 1-309-834-0323 in the US.</p>
