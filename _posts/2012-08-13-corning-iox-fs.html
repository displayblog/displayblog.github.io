<p><a href="http://www.corning.com/specialtymaterials/products_capabilities/iox-fs.aspx">Corning</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Corning&Acirc;&reg; IOX-FS  is a full sheet ion-exchanged glass that enables integrated touch or one glass solution through ITO deposition on large-sized glass. IOX-FS demonstrates superior surface damage resistance and retained strength while enabling glass separation and finishing after ion exchange and ITO sensor deposition.</blockquote></p>
<p>In other words, this is Gorilla Glass lite + touch.</p>
