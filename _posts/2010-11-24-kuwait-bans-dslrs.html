<p><a href="http://www.kuwaittimes.net/read_news.php?newsid=MzAwMTg4ODg1">Kuwait Times</a> &rarr; <a href="http://thenextweb.com/me/2010/11/23/kuwait-dslr-camera-ban-now-in-effect/">The Next Web</a> &rarr; <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/24/kuwait-bans-dslrs-leaves-micro-four-thirds-question-hanging-in/">Engadget</a>: According to Kuwait Times the recreational use of DSLRs in public is now illegal in Kuwait. The only exception is if you're a journalist. Are mirror-less interchangeable lens cameras like the Sony NEX-5 okay? Probably not if it has the zoom less. And probably okay if it has the pancake. Just make sure your camera doesn't <em>look</em> like a DSLR. Better yet use your smartphone.</p>
<p>I have fond memories of living in Kuwait, especially swimming in the warm and crystal clear Persian Gulf; this was back in the mid-70s. As an avid photographer I don't think I'd want to be there right now. Unfortunate.</p>
