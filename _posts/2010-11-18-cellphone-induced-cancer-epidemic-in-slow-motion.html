<p>Devra Davis, epidemiologist and author of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525951946?ie=UTF8&tag=displ0f-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0525951946">Disconnect</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=displ0f-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0525951946" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />," via <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/14/business/14digi.html?_r=1">The New York Times</a> regarding researching findings linking cellphone use and cancer:</p>
<blockquote><p>I do think I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m looking at an epidemic in slow motion.</blockquote></p>
<p>Davis recommends: Keeping the cellphone away from the head or body by using a wired earpiece or the speakerphone. Children are more at risk because of a thinner skull that allows radiation to penetrate deeper into the brain. Pregnant women should be careful to keep cellphones away from the abdomen area.</p>
<p>This is making me think, "Do I really need a cellphone?" Do I need to be reachable by voice at all times? Can I make do with text messages and email? I'll need to think about this. The thing that worries me most is that I almost always keep my iPhone in my pant pocket when I'm away from the house.</p>
