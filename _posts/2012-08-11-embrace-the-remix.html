<p><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/kirby_ferguson_embrace_the_remix.html">TED</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nothing is original, says Kirby Ferguson, creator of Everything is a Remix. From Bob Dylan to Steve Jobs, he says our most celebrated creators borrow, steal and transform.</blockquote></p>
<p>Copy, transform, combine: The elements of all creativity, according to Ferguson. Worth a watch especially in light of the Apple-Samsung lawsuit happening right now.</p>
