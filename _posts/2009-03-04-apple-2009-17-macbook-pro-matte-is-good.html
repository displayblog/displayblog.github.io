<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-4335 aligncenter" title="apple_2009_17_macbook_pro_matte" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/apple_2009_17_macbook_pro_matte.jpg" alt="apple_2009_17_macbook_pro_matte" width="500" height="284" /></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Engadget posted up a lightning review of the 2009 <a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250:utpr0mvi0e9&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=17"+macbook+pro&amp;sa=Search">17" MacBook Pro</a>. I'm, of course, interested on what Joshua Topolsky had to say about the display. He did say this about the LED LCD on the 15": "... we noted that the glare on the new LED displays is so intense that it's actually quite distracting in anything other than a lowly lit room." So there you go.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The LCD on the left is from a 15" MacBook Pro. The LCD on the right is from a 17" MacBook Pro with the matte LCD option. If you need your notebook to work as a mirror from time to time then the glare-type LCD would be the right choice. If on the other hand you don't need a mirror and would rather not have posters from the wall distracting you from your work or play, then the $50 option to get the matte LCD on the 17" MacBook Pro is a must. Easy choice.</p></p>
