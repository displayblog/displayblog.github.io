<p>I can understand how a high-tech gadget can become something of an artistic piece. The BeoVision 5 comes to mind: a nice square sculpture that happens to be a 42" PDP TV. But, I&#39;m not too keen on trying to make a high-tech gadget into a piece of jewelry or something like a jewelry or incorporating jewelry. I never liked the idea of putting diamonds into mobile phones either. So, when I ran across an article on <a href="http://www.techdigest.tv/2006/05/loewe_individua.html" target="_blank">TechDigest</a> about Loewe&#39;s limited edition 32" LCD TV called Individual Edition 1, I thought, "Wow, somebody sure doesn&#39;t know what TVs are about." It&#39;s a limited edition of only 2000 units, which means there will be 2000 idiots. Where are the Swarovski crystals, you ask? On the side. The article says that there are two color options: one with black with dark crystal side inlay panels and the other with silver body color with light crystal side inlay panels. When this becomes available around June 2006, the price will be 5,000 euros.</p>
