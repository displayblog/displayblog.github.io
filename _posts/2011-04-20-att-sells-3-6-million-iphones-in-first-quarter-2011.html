<p><a href="http://www.att.com/gen/press-room?pid=19727&cdvn=news&newsarticleid=31831&mapcode=financial">AT&T</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>iPhone activations increased nearly 1 million year over year to 3.6 million, with 23 percent of subscribers new to AT&T; iPhone subscriber churn unchanged year over year</blockquote></p>
<p>The overall smartphone market is growing and I'm sure all carriers including AT&T will continue to benefit from selling one of the most popular smartphones, the iPhone. This quarterly announcement by AT&T does not mean the carrier was effective in keeping current iPhone customers or that Verizon was ineffective in taking them away. I expect Verizon to announce strong iPhone sales, too.</p>
