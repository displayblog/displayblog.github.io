<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-2C2gb6ws8">Bertrand Serlet on Microsoft's Vista</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you can't innovate I guess you just imitate but it is never quite as good as the original.</blockquote></p>
<p>Unless you're Apple. Apple ripped off Xerox PARC's original GUI concept, innovated, and commercialized a GUI-based operating system for the masses. For round two, Apple bought Steve Jobs' NeXTSTEP operating system (actually the entire NeXT company), made it prettier, and renamed it OS X. Apple then, all by itself, birthed iOS.</p>
