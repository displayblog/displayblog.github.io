<blockquote><p>Prices of TV panels are expected to stage an uptick in June although the extent of the hikes could be limited, according to industry sources. As makers have been keeping their capacity utilization rates at low levels and TV panel prices have reached cash-cost levels, there is room for price increases.</blockquote></p>
<p>This doesn't necessarily mean that you'll see higher LCD TV <em>set</em> prices, but it does mean that TV brands like Samsung and Sony will likely deal with lower profit margins. Of course if LCD TV panels prices continue to increase, to a point where brands cannot or will not tolerate razor-thin margins, prices of LCD TV sets will increase.</p>
