<p>It is US$16,000. A bit late to market considering Sharp was expecting a March rollout. The LC-57D90U was announced during CES 2006 along with the larger 65" LC-65D90U. The 57" LCD TV sports a Full HD resolution of 1920 x 1080. It better, for that price. Response times were stated at less than 4ms back in CES, with a dynamic contrast ratio of 1500:1.</p>

<p>It probably uses Sharp's proprietary TFT LCD wide viewing angle technology called Advanced Super View (ASV). Other features include 450 cd/m2 of brightness, an integrated ATSC tuner, a HDMI input and is CableCard plug and play ready. It was interesting to see how such an expensive unit can be "Out of stock" at <a href="http://www.crutchfield.com/S-b6xUbSTZlnq/cgi-bin/ProdView.asp?g=146350&amp;I=28457D90U">Crutchfield</a>, but then again they probably didn't stock that many. $16000... I can buy a car with that kind of money.</p>
<p>According to engadget, Home Theater Mag had trouble with the LC-57D90U when hooking up a 1080p signal via HDMI. This is interesting because the only 1080p video source comes out of a PC and is encoded in Microsoft's WMV format. Even Blu-Ray HD content tops out at 1080i. The TV or a intermediary box will need to de-interlace the 1080i content to progressively scan the video and display it on the LC-57D90U. I am very curious as to what video source Home Theater Mag was using.</p>
