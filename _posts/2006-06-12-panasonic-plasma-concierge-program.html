<p>Facts: The Panasonic Plasma Concierge program offers customers four main privileges:</p>
<p>1. Live Access: To specialized plasma TV consultants to resolve issues.</p>
<p>2. Priority Service: 24-hour turn-around time to schedule in-home service visits upon notification.</p>
<p>3. Panasonic Plasma Concierge Benefits Card: All customer information is stored that enable quick support. Includes a dedicated toll-free phone number.</p>
<p>4. Additional services intro in September: Exclusive online content, personalized product info and online chat.</p>
<p>Opinion: Finally. One of the most frustrating things about setting up a HD set is the complexity. I believe it is harder than setting up a PC! Panasonic has responded to consumers of HD, plasma-based or others, that have extreme difficulty in setting up the myriad of connections to make their TVs look like what they saw at the store. I think consumers will like it. I hope the added cost of customer service does not translate into higher prices. Any LCD TV folks reading this?</p>
