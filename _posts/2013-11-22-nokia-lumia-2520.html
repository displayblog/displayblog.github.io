<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/22/5133378/nokia-lumia-2520-review">Dan Seifert, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Without those extras and no kickstand, the 2520 feels very much like any other 10-inch tablet. Its 16:9 display is great in landscape orientation, but it's cumbersome to use in portrait mode for reading and other tasks. The 1920 x 1080 pixel panel looks great &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s really bright, has the same ClearBlack technology that Nokia uses on smartphones, and can be used outdoors without issue. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s great for browsing the web, playing games, and watching videos, but it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a bit too contrasty and harsh when you want to read a book. The 2520 has a pixel density of 218PPI, which is less than the iPad Air and other tablets in this range. But while pixels are visible if you look closely, for the most part it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not an issue and text is crisp enough to my eyes.</blockquote></p>
<p>Reading an ebook is very similar to reading text on websites, so I'm concerned with Seifert's observation that the Nokia Lumia 2520 is &acirc;&euro;&oelig;a bit too contrasty and harsh when you want to read a book&acirc;&euro;¬ù. Why the good engineers at Nokia don't understand color accuracy is more important than punchy inaccurate color is lost on me. Perhaps the problem isn't the lack of knowledge by Nokia's engineers, but by upper management.</p>
