<p>Taiwan-based Wintek will invest in a LCD module plant in India. Wintek manufactures small/medium LCD panels. The LCD module plant will specialize in modulizing mobile phone LCDs and will be located in the Nokia Telecom Special Economic Zone. Wintek's new module plant will be India's first and will supply major mobile phone brands. Currently, Wintek's largest customer is Motorola but that will change and shift to Nokia in the future according to the company.</p>
<p>Nokia plans to invest US$150 million into the Special Economic Zone to establish mobile phone and related telecommunication equipment and facilities. Wintek is currently the world's largest mobile phone panel supplier with the purchase of a G3 TFT LCD fab from struggling HannStar Display for about US$186 in September 2006.</p>
