<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20101012PD207.html">Digitimes</a> is reporting Samsung 32-inch LCD TVs have dropped to under US$399 while 40-inch "LED TVs" have dropped to below $1000 at Best Buy. Want a Vizio instead? Hop on over to Walmart for a $358 price on a 32-inch or just $548 for a 42 incher. And it's only mid-October.</p>
