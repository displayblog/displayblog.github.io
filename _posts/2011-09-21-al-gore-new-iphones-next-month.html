<p><a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/09/21/apple-board-member-al-gore-speaking-at-conference-confirms-iphone-5-in-october/">Matthew Panzarino at TNW Apple</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Former Vice President and Apple board member Al Gore has confirmed that new iPhones will be released in October. He specifically stated that &acirc;&euro;&tilde;the new iPhones would be out next month&acirc;&euro;&trade; at the Discovery Invest Leadership Summit today.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://allthingsd.com/20110921/apple-to-hold-special-event-on-october-4/?mod=socialflow">John Paczkowski at AllThingsD</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tuesday, Oct. 4.</p>
<p>That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the day Apple is currently expected to hold its next big media event, according to sources close to the situation, where the tech giant will unveil the next iteration of its popular iPhone.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/09/21/if-iphone-5-is-unveiled-oct-4-when-will-it-go-on-sale/">Philip Elmer-DeWitt at Fortune Tech</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A look at previous lag-times suggests that he is right. As the chart at right shows, the wait between iPhone introduction and sale has decreased from 171 days in 2007 to 17 days in 2010.</p>
<p>Likewise, the lag time for the iPad shrank from 66 days in 2010 to 9 days this year.</blockquote></p>
<p>Elmer-DeWitt is referring to Brian White, Managing Director of Equity Research at Ticonderoga Securities who suggested the time between announcement and availability will be short.</p>
<p>Apple likes Tuesdays to announce products. More accurately Steve Jobs likes Tuesdays. I've heard Tuesday is ideal for a couple of reasons. Most folks are just getting over the weekend and revving up on Mondays. So anything announced on Mondays might fall on sleepy ears. Having an event on Tuesday allows reporters a day during the workweek to get to Cupertino. No one likes to waste a weekend trying to get to a meeting on Monday. Tuesday is also early enough in the week for the announcement to pack news bandwidth through Friday. So Tuesday, October 4 it may well be.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs likes Fridays too. To make things available for you to buy. This also makes sense to me. Friday is a wind down day. A day when your bank account gets an ACH direct injection of funds. The day before the weekend so you can play with your new toy. I'm not a betting man, but here's my guess to when those new iPhones will be available for purchase: October 7. Yes, it's only three days after the announcement, but this time around, for federal employees and a few lucky folks, its a three day weekend thanks to Columbus Day.</p>
<p>Did Gore say iPhones as in two iPhones? You mean the low-cost iPhone 4S and the completely redesigned iPhone 5 with a larger display? Color me pessimistic, but I think Gore just meant there will be iPhones as in a black one and a white one with different storages. Like what we have now with the iPhone 4. You see Apple likes manufacturing efficiency. More accurately Tim Cook bleeds manufacturing efficiency. And building two completely different iPhones at the same time would go directly against what Cook is all about. So that's why I don't see two different iPhones being announced. If I were to pick it'd be an <a href="/2010/12/03/iphone-4s/">iPhone 4S</a>.</p>
