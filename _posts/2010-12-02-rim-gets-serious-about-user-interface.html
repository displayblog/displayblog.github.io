<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/12/tat-blackberry-redesign/">Wired</a>: Research In Motion (RIM) announced that it has acquired TAT (The Astonishing Tribe), an interface design firm based in Sweden. RIM is getting serious about user interface design it seems. I'm not a BlackBerry user but I do appreciate the simple icons.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/BlackBerry_UI_Icons-1.jpg" alt="" title="BlackBerry_UI_Icons-1" width="538" height="264" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15139" /></p>
<p>The icons are simple but have enough detail to easily figure out what they are for. There are some problems in terms of layout though. In the photo above there are six icons per row. That's too many.</p>
<p>Touch-enabled BlackBerry icons should be bigger to match the size of a finger. The UI on the iPhone probably has the best implementation: four icons per row on a 3.5-inch display. BlackBerry should do the same.</p>
<p>On the flip side, I would love to see iPhone icons in BlackBerry style.</p>
<p>There is one technical argument I'd like to make. The outline-styled simple icons on the BlackBerry are perfectly suited for an OLED display. Here's why: OLEDs consume zero power when it is black. A BlackBerry sporting the current UI design combined with a Super AMOLED would last a lot longer between charges. The UI would look fantastic too with incredibly deep blacks.</p>
<p>Back to TAT:</p>

<p>Neat ideas.</p>
