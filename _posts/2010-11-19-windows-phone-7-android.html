<p>John Gruber on <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/11/where_are_the_android_killer_apps">Daring Fireball</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A final thought, regarding Android&acirc;&euro;&trade;s relative weakness as a software platform. iOS&acirc;&euro;&trade;s exclusivity for a bunch of big-name mobile games &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; Need for Speed Undercover, Star Wars: Battle for Hoth, Monopoly, Tetris, The Sims, Assassin&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Creed &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; has been broken. Not by Android, where none of these games exist, but by Windows Phone 7, a one-month-old platform.</blockquote></p>
<p>Gruber's observation is intriguing. Why is it that Android was not able to break iOS' exclusivity on these games?</p>
<p>If potential smartphone buyers go for Android because they don't want or can't buy the iPhone then there's a good chance that these same folks will go for WP7 phones instead of Android. Why? Because there are better apps, including games like the ones mentioned above.</p>
