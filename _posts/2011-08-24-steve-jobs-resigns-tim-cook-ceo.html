<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/08/24Letter-from-Steve-Jobs.html">Letter from Steve Jobs</a>, <em>via</em> <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2011/08/24/steve-jobs-resigns-as-apple-ceo/">The Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>To the Apple Board of Directors and the Apple Community:</p>
<p>I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s CEO, I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come.</p>
<p>I hereby resign as CEO of Apple. I would like to serve, if the Board sees fit, as Chairman of the Board, director and Apple employee.</p>
<p>As far as my successor goes, I strongly recommend that we execute our succession plan and name Tim Cook as CEO of Apple.</p>
<p>I believe Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s brightest and most innovative days are ahead of it. And I look forward to watching and contributing to its success in a new role.</p>
<p>I have made some of the best friends of my life at Apple, and I thank you all for the many years of being able to work alongside you.</p>
<p>Steve</blockquote></p>
<p>... why does an individual whom I've never met have such a powerful influence. My spirit is dampened. "Dear God, please bless Steve Jobs. Amen."</p>
