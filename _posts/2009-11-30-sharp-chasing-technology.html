excerpt: "Atul Goyal, CLSA research analyst, thinks Sharp is making a mistake by chasing
  technology with its new Sakai-based LCD factory, the world's largest. I beg to differ.

  is leading in areas that give the company a technological advantage and the size
  gives it a cost advantage. <a href=\"http://\">UV2A</a> is a good example
  of both. Sharp's new liquid crystal alignment technology improves contrast, lowers
  power consumption as well as reduce manufacturing costs. Sharp's 10th generation
  LCD fabrication is the most expensive manufacturing site built in Japan's history.

  difficult and costly to transport very thin but very large LCD glass substrates.

<blockquote><p>It remains to be seen whether it makes sense for Sharp to keep seeking ever more-sophisticated production in Japan, or, as competitors have, to simply use less advanced production techniques at lower costs in places like China.</blockquote><br />
Most of the world's LCD panel manufacturing is done in South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. LCD panel production requires very little human intervention, but does require advanced technologies in many areas. After the LCD panels are produced they are shipped mostly to China where they are modularized: people put together the LCD panel with backlight units, multiple PCBs, LCD casing, etc. The modularization process is where costs can be saved by moving to lower-labor countries like China. LCD manufacturers have been doing this for quite some time, including Sharp. To assume that <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=samsung&amp;sa=Search#1363">Samsung</a>, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=lg+display&amp;sa=Search#1363">LG Display</a>, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=au+optronics&amp;sa=Search#1115">AU Optronics</a> (AUO), <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=chi+mei+optoelectronics&amp;sa=Search#1410">Chi Mei Optoelectronics</a> (CMO) and others are using "less advanced production techniques at lower costs in places like China" to manufacture LCD panels is absurd. All of these companies search for and develop advanced technology to improve display performance while reducing manufacturing costs.
