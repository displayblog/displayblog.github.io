<p>Just a quick note: The A5515K mobile phone has a 2.2" 240 x 320 TFT LCD that uses Sharp's Mobile ASV panel. ASV stands for Advanced Super View and is Sharp's proprietarily developed vertical alignment (VA) technology and offers wide viewing angles. Another cool feature of this phone is the use of nVidia's GoForce (that's Go, not Ge) 4000 to accelerate the graphics. Wow, even mobile phones have a GPU now!</p>
