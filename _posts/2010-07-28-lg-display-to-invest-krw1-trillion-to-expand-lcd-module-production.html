<p>LG Display (LGD) plans to invest KRW1 trillion to expand its LCD module production capability in the next three years from 2010 to 2013. What particular LCD modules? Tablet PC panels and OLED products. LGD will need it since it is the primary supplier for Apple's iPad. Maybe LGD will be making OLED panels for Apple in the near future?
