<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=asahi-glass">Asahi Glass</a> Co. (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=agc">AGC</a>) is the world's second largest supplier of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-glass">LCD glass</a>, only behind Corning. There are three major centers of LCD production and they are located in South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. AGC announced on July 18, 2008 that it would begin building a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=g8.5">G8.5</a> (eight point five generation) LCD glass production facility in Taiwan starting in August. This LCD glass production facility will be AGC's fifth plant in Taiwan. The total investment for the project is estimated at JPY20 billion. The G5 LCD plant is expected to be completed by early 2009 and supply <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=au-optronics">AU Optronics</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=auo">AUO</a>), <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=chi-mei-optoelectronics">Chi Mei Optoelectronics</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=cmo">CMO</a>) and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=chunghwa-picture-tubes">Chunghwa Picture Tubes</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=cpt">CPT</a>) among others.
