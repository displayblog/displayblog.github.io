<p>Delta Electronics announced that it will stop production of CCFL in March 2010. CCFL continues to be the dominant light source for LCD backlights but the transition to LED is rapid. Delta has 31 CCFL production lines in Taoyuan, Taiwan and in Wujiang, China. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=led+backlight&amp;sa=Search#1348">LED backlights</a> for LCD applications larger than 10 inches are expected to overtake those with CCFL in 2011 and capture more than 60% market share in 2012. Other CCFL manufacturers such as Wellypower, Sintronic Technology, Gio Optoelectronics, etc. have been actively shifting to LED. The transition from CCFL to LED has a few benefits: no mercury, less power consumption, and more ruggedness. Source: <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20091204PD210.html">DIGITIMES</a></p>
