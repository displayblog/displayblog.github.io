<p><a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120806/iphone-caused-crisis-of-design-at-samsung-memo/">Mike Isaac, AllThingsD</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>And the memo is rife with ammunition. Here&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Shin again, on what Samsung could do to catch up from behind:</p>
<p><em>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;I hear things like this: Let&acirc;&euro;&trade;s make something like the iPhone.&acirc;&euro;</em></p>
<p>And again:</p>
<p><em>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;When everybody (both consumers and the industry) talk about UX, they weigh it against the iPhone. The iPhone has become the standard. That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s how things are already.&acirc;&euro;</em></p>
<p>And yet again:</p>
<p><em>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Do you know how difficult the Omnia is to use? When you compare the 2007 version of the iPhone with our current Omnia, can you honestly say the Omnia is better? If you compare the UX with the iPhone, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a difference between Heaven and Earth.&acirc;&euro;</em></blockquote></p>
<p>The bit about it being the difference between heaven and earth sounds a bit too dramatic translated into English; let's not get carried away. In Korean, it's: &iacute;&bull;&tilde;&euml;&Scaron;&tilde;&ecirc;&sup3;&frac14; &euml;&bull;&hellip; &igrave;&deg;&uml;&igrave;&acute;. Which means: There's a big difference.</p>
