<p><a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/marc-newson-the-new-guy-behind-the-apple-watch-10229835.html">John Arlidge, London Evening Standard</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What about the suggestion that an object you replace after a year or two because it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s outdated cannot be a premium product because true luxury stands the test of time? <em>Long silence.</em> &acirc;&euro;&tilde;The way I see it, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s evolution, progress,&acirc;&euro;&trade; Newson recovers. &acirc;&euro;&tilde;And we are doing wonderful things. In one of the versions of the watch, the box it comes in acts as a charging device that you can use for other models. So it becomes a useful object and not something that will just sit in the top drawer of your cupboard for the rest of eternity.&acirc;&euro;&trade;</blockquote></p>
<p>True luxury stands the test of time. A Leica M9 with a Summicron lens will. An iPhone will not; it starts to fade from day one.</p>
<p>An Apple Watch, even the US$15,000 gold version, will last about a year. A fifteen year old Rolex Air-King will continue as luxury.</p>
<p>When the Apple Watch 2, or whatever it will be called, comes out in 2016 owners of the one year old Apple Watch will carefully place it in the useful box and put it in a drawer. There it will remain, forever. And forgotten.</p>
<p>That's just how it is with gadgets racing toward progress.</p>
