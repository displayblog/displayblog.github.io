<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=samsung">Samsung</a>'s original Haptic <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=smartphone">smartphone</a> was unveiled to the world back in March and sold for KRW 700,000, which is quite a lot. Even at such a premium price, Samsung sold more than 500,000 units in 1H'08 in the South Korean market. Samsung is now launching its Haptic 2 smartphones. <a id="more"></a><a id="more-2610"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=haptic">Haptic</a> implies that there is feedback and in the case of Samsung's Haptic 2 smartphones there are visual, audio and physical feedback. The physical feedback is based on micro motors that generate small vibrations. When you touch the display, the Haptic 2 responds by vibrating. The visual feedback is of course via the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=3.2"">3.2"</a> TFT LCD with capacitive multi-touch display. Starting at noon on September 27, Samsung will be available for purchase on a first-come first-serve basis at the Sinchon Anycall Studio.</p>
<p>An unique feature is that you have a customizable haptic funtion that allows you to create the type of haptic feedback you want. The original Haptic had 15 widget icons, the Haptic 2 increases that to 50 increasing the customization quotient by quite a bit. Some of those widgets include: Memo Widget, Four Resolutions (for dieting and quiting smoking, etc.) and a "Daily Life Timer". These names are just my translations from their original Korean titles so they will most likely end up being different.</p>
<p>Samsung is reporting that its new Haptic 2 touch capabilities have been enhanced with smoother drag and drop, picture flipping, fingerwriting recognition functions. There also an interesting "music therapy" function and the Haptic 2 informs you of your bio-rhythms. Samsung has put quite a bit into the Haptic 2 series smartphones and I do hope the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=multitouch">multitouch</a> experience has improved over the prior generation.</p>
