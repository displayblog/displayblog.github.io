<p>On February 15, 2008, IPS Alpha Technology announced plans to construct a Gen. 8 TFT LCD plant in Himeji City, Hyogo Prefecture, Japan. IPS Alpha currently has a Gen. 6 LCD plant running. As the name suggests, IPS Alpha makes use of In-Plane Switching (IPS) technology that was originally developed by Hitachi, who is part of the joint venture. IPS technology is best known by professionals who require great color fidelity at different viewing angles and is used extensively by companies such as Apple for its Cinema HD line of LCD monitors. Construction for IPS Alpha's Gen. 8 LCD fab is expected to begin in August 2008 with volume production to commence in January 2010. IPS Alpha is investing about JPY300 billion (about US$2.8 billion) for the new plant. The addition of the Gen. 8 fab will allow IPS Alpha to increase production from 6 million 32"-equivalent LCD panels to 21 million by 2013. The other company who is heavily invested in IPS technology is LG.Philips LCD, who will be soon changing its name to LG Display.</p>
