<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=ford">Ford</a> has revealed a gauge cluster called SmartGauge with EcoGuide that uses two LCDs. This technology will be incorporated into Ford's 2010 Fusion Hybrid and Mercury's 2010 Milan Hybrid cars. The centrally-mounted speedometer is analog but to the left and right is all high-tech with graphics that can be personalized to provide four different level of details including fuel economy, odometer, coolant temperature, gear, trip data, fuel efficiency, etc. Looks very cool!</p>
