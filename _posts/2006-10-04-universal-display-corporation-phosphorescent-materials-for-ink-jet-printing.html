<p>On September 20, 2006, Universal Display Corporation (UDC), a Ewing, New Jersey-based display materials company, announced there were significant advances in the development of its P2OLEDs, which are printable phosphorescent OLEDs. This work is being undertaken with Seiko Epson. Cost-effective, large-area OLED displays have been a pipe-dream for many years: they may continue to be for many more, but the demonstration of P2OLED materials with high light efficiencies and ink-jet printability will aid in bringing large but affordable OLED displays a step closer to reality. Seiko Epson and Universal Display has been working on P2OLEDs that are based on small-molecule PHOLED materials for almost two years.</p>
<p>The technical details are:</p>
<p>A saturated red color with CIE coordinates of (0.66, 0.34), a luminous efficiency of 7 candelas per Ampere (cd/A) and more than 14,000 hours of operating lifetime (defined as time to 50% of initial luminance) from an initial luminance of 500 candelas per square meter (cd/m2).</p>
<p>Another saturated red with CIE coordinates of (0.67, 0.33), 11 cd/A and 12,000 hours of operating lifetime from an initial luminance of 500 cd/m2.</p>
<p>A green with CIE coordinates of (0.34, 0.62), 33 cd/A and over 8,000 hours of operating lifetime from an initial luminance of 1000 cd/m2.</p>
<p>UDC&acirc;&euro;&trade;s PHOLED technology is already being manufactured using conventional vacuum thermal evaporation (VTE) equipment and have efficiences that are four times higher than traditional OLED systems.</p>
