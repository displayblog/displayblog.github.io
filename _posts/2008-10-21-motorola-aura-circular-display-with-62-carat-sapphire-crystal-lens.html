<p><a href="http://gizmodo.com/5066534/motorola-aura-the-phone-that-thinks-its-a-watch">Gizmodo</a>: The Motorola Aura mobile phone is one unique-looking phone. The Aura uses a circular display that is 1.55-inch in diameter and can display 16 million colors with a resolution of 300 dpi. According to Motorola, the Aura is the world's first mobile phone to incorporate a circular display. The display looks quite upscale. And I must say that I am somewhat (pleasantly) surprised to see Motorola break out of the tired candybar and clamshell mold.</p>
<p>To prevent scratching, much like high-end watches, the display covered with a lens that feature 62-carat sapphire crystal, "one of the most scratch-resistant materials on earth". Sounds impressive. Want to know what the price is? US$2,000. For that enormous price, you get 130 ball bearings (good for 100,000 flips) that are used to flip open the blade, 700 individual components, quad-band GPRS and EDGE connectivity, 2GB of internal memory, AGPS, a 2MP camera and a 304 stainless steel housing with chemically etched textures. The Aura will be available on December 4, 2008.</p>
<p><em>Update 2008.10.27 10:53AM PST:</em> If you want an exhaustive review of the MOTOAURA, hop on over to <a href="http://www.mobile-review.com/review/motorola-motoaura-en.shtml">mobile-review</a> where you will find all the pictures you'd ever want of the high-end couture mobile phone. Check out the screensavers especially the ones that make it a clock (like the picture above). Very nicely done Motorola!</p>
