<p><a href="http://www.toshiba.co.jp/about/press/2011_04/pr1801.htm">Toshiba</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Toshiba Mobile Display Co., Ltd. (Fukaya City, Saitama Pref.), a wholly-owned subsidiary and manufacturer of medium- and small-sized LCD displays, started partial production at its manufacturing line in Fukaya on March 28 and will resume full operation by the end of April. The company is supplying some products from Ishikawa Works, the company's other production facility in Ishikawa Prefecture.</blockquote></p>
<p>Toshiba Mobile Display (TMD) manufactures high-end LTPS-based LCDs. Although I don't know whether or not the company began manufacturing displays for Apple, the Fukaya line is on its way back to full operation. My prayers go to Japan.</p>
