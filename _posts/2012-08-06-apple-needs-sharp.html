<p><a href="http://9to5mac.com/2012/08/06/foxconn-to-keep-sharp-afloat-as-an-apple-parts-supplier/">Jake Smith, 9to5 Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple, of course, is one of the biggest parts buyers in the world, as it buys from Sharp, Foxconn, LG, Japan Display, and more.</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple's primary business with Foxconn is purchasing the company's integration services, not parts. LG? No, not LG. When you mention LG almost everyone assumes LG Electronics. It's not LGE; it's LG Display, one of the largest pure play display manufacturers in the world.</p>
<blockquote><p>Without a key supplier like Sharp, Cupertino-based Apple could face huge delays when shipping a product by not keeping up with demand.</blockquote></p>
<p>Sharp's LCD capacity is relatively small compared to South Korea-based Samsung Display, LG Display, Taiwan-based Chimei Innolux (CMI), and AU Optronics (AUO). If Sharp was no more Apple could procure enough LCDs from these four companies without having much of an impact on its ability to meet demand.</p>
<p>No doubt Sharp is a display technology powerhouse: Recently the company was first to unveil its oxide-based TFT solution called <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/11/23/sharp-igzo-based-ipad-3-retina-display/">IGZO</a>. But all major display manufacturers have been researching oxide TFTs for quite some time and it will only be a matter of time, a very short time, before volume production commences.</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple needs Sharp.</blockquote></p>
<p>No, Apple does not.</p>
