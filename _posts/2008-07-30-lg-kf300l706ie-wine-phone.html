<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lg">LG</a>'s KF300 aka L706ie aka the Wine Phone has a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=2.4"">2.4"</a> TFT LCD for the main display and a smaller 1.8" design-integrated display on the cover. The 2.4" LCD sports a pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=240-x-320">240 x 320</a>, pretty standard for clamshell designed mobile phones. I must say the picture taken by AVING is very well done as it shows its elegant design. It is hard to describe in words, but if there was a picture of the Wine Phone next to a glass of white wine it wouldn't look out of place. The Wine Phone will make its Japanese debut on August 1, 2008.</p>
