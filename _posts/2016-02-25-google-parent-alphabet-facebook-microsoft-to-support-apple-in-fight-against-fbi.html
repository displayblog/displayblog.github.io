<p>[ <a href="http://www.wsj.com/news/article_email/google-facebook-to-support-apple-in-court-1456434617-lMyQjAxMTE2MTI2NTMyMzUwWj">The Wall Street Journa</a>l ] Deepa Deetharaman and Jack Nicas:</p>
<blockquote><p>Several tech companies, including Google parent Alphabet Inc., Facebook Inc. and Microsoft Corp., plan to file a joint motion supporting Apple Inc. in its court fight against the Justice Department over unlocking an alleged terrorist&rsquo;s iPhone, according to people familiar with the companies&rsquo; plans.</blockquote></p>
<p>At first I thought the FBI wanted Apple to help unlock a single iPhone. But that's not true: the FBI wants Apple to weaken its iOS operating system so it can unlock a bunch of other iPhones. The FBI knows this will set a legal precedent so it can continue to force Apple to weaken security on its products and services. Google's parent company Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft, and probably a few more know they will be targeted to no end if the FBI gets its way with Apple.</p>
