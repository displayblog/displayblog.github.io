<p>Note: The EMP-TW2000 front projector actually uses a 3LCD system rather than DLP as stated by Trusted Reviews in the title.</p>
<p>Trusted Reviews praises the Epson TW2000 for its black levels: "In fact, I'd go so far as to say the TW2000 delivers one of the deepest black levels I've ever seen from an LCD projector." However TR notes that JVC's DLA-HD1 projector has even deeper levels with a similar price. Another weakness is a slightly blurred look on horizontal movements and finally standard definition was a bit rough due to non-optimum utilization of PixelWorks' DNX image processing. Ultimately TR concludes that the TW200 is Epson's finest to date but due to the high price it falls a bit short compared to its competitors such as the InFocus IN82 and the JVC DLA-HD1. TR gives the EMP-TW2000 a score of 8/10.</p>
<p>The EMP-TW2000 can take 1080p/24 video input and has a broader color gamut thanks to it using the xvYCC picture format. The 50,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio should yield some impressive pictures.</p>
<p>It seems the EMP-TW2000 model number is not available in the US. Instead, you have the PowerLite Pro Cinema 1080 UB series front projectors in the US. I believe these are the same models. </p>
