<p>The LCD and glass covering are separate components. In the first iPhone the two were glued together. This design change might have been due to two things: one, it is easier and cheaper to manufacture two separate items. Two, it is easier to replace if necessary. iFixit had to remove 6 Philips #00 screws to separate the glass from the LCD. The glass is where touch capability is integrated including the sensors and chips.</p>
