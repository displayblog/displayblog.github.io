<p>According to China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) the total number of 3G subscribers in China will surpass 10 million by the end of 2009. It has only been since early 2009 that China has granted three 3G mobile communication licenses. These three licensees will have invested a total of CNY143.5 billion (about US$21 billion) by the end of 2009 to establish the 3G infrastructure that includes 285,000 base stations in China. At this rate, China will become the largest, by far, market for 3G and faster mobile devices. Source: <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20091225PD202.html">DIGITIMES</a></p>
