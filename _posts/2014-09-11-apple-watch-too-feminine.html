<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/11088667/Apple-Watch-too-feminine-and-looks-like-it-was-designed-by-students-says-LVMH-executive.html">The Telegraph</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jean-Claude Biver, who heads the French group&acirc;&euro;&trade;s luxury watch division, said the US tech giant had made &acirc;&euro;&oelig;some fundamental mistakes&acirc;&euro; designing the Apple Watch.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;This watch has no sex appeal. It's too feminine and looks too much like the smartwatches already on the market,&acirc;&euro; Mr Biver said in an interview with daily Die Welt.</blockquote></p>
<p>Let me get this right. Biver thinks the Apple Watch is too feminine and therefore has no sex appeal. Oxymoronic.</p>
