<p>Samsung announced its CX225MD LCD TV, a 22" LCD TV with a resolution of 1680 x 1050. That's the first problem. A TV should have a 16:9 aspect ratio, but that resolution leads to a 16:10 aspect ratio. Not that much difference in numbers, but unnecessary black bars are not my style. Samsung makes a more glaring mistake by having a Full HD logo on the set. Full HD refers to a resolution of 1920 x 1080 and is able to display motion picture in 1080p. Not so with the CX225MD; it has only 1680 x 1050. The CX225MD does have a TV tuner and a HDMI port, but if you like to watch HD content at its regular aspect ratio, you might be a bit surprised at the output with all the scaling necessary.</p>

<p>This is definitely a mixture of features and specifications from both the LCD monitor world and the LCD TV world. A 16:10 aspect ratio is a first for LCD TVs and so is the resolution of 1680 x 1050. Of course, the inclusion of a TV tuner would make it a TV. The HDMI port also gives it away as a TV. But have we not seen LCD monitors with HDMI ports already? Also, there have been multifunction LCD monitors from Samsung that sported a TV tuner in a LCD monitor box.</p>
<p>So, what do I think of all of this? The distinction between high-end LCD monitor and a regular LCD TV has started to blur, thanks to Samsung and its CX225MD. The distinction was really just industry-made. There are many reasons why this trend will continue. First, users have started to use LCD monitors as a TV screen and a LCD TV as a monitor screen. Second, the technical capabilities have started to merge, though I would still go for a high-end LCD TV to get the best performance of both monitor and TV worlds. Third, with the addition of HD gaming consoles, the "regular" uses for LCD monitors and LCD TVs have been further blurred. We do not need an artificial distinction. Just get us large, high-resolution displays with no motion blur, high constrast ratios, and 100% NTSC.</p>
