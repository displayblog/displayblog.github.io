<blockquote><p>When current available Markdown editors are almost all for general writers, Mou is different: It's for web developers. Syntax highlighting, live preview, fullscreen mode, auto save, powerful actions, auto pair, incremental search, custom themes, HTML export, enhanced CJK characters support. I know, it's exactly the app you want.</blockquote></p>
<p>I've been fiddling with Mou for a few days and I like it. I'm not a web developer, but as an online content writer Mou might be just what I've been looking for.</p>
<p>One of the main benefits of Markdown is it lets you focus on writing while at the same time adding HTML elements. I find Markdown most helpful with lists and when I'm rereading my work for possible revisions. Reading with HTML code scattered all over the place is a visual chore; Markdown alleviates this problem. I've been trying to integrate Markdown into my workflow for quite some time with limited success.</p>
<p>TextWrangler is a decent solution. I have set it up so when I press a key combination, my work in Markdown is converted into HTML. I then copy the HTML and paste it into WordPress. This comes in handy when I want to create a quick list, but doesn't give me the confidence to completely depend on it for writing posts. What TextWrangler lacks is instant preview. And that's where Mou comes in.</p>
<p>Mou has a lot of features including custom themes and CSS, but the most important is instant preview. It has a calming effect and reassures me the Markdown code I'm typing into my writing looks the way I want it to. Mou and Markdown is a potent combination, minimizing distractions to help writers, general as well as web developers, focus on writing.</p>
