<p>In response to <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/hardware/microsoft-gets-it-right-with-windows-8-on-arm-and-why-apple-should-be-worried/18071">Adrian Kingsley-Hughes</a>, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/02/apple_should_be_worried">John Gruber</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The iPad was not designed to be all things for all people. How much better would the iPad need to be selling to convince these pundits that Apple nailed it, that they struck gold with the iPad&acirc;&euro;&trade;s concept and execution? There may well be gold in other spots on the tablet frontier, but Apple is going to keep digging in the same spot.</blockquote></p>
<p>The only thing Apple is worried about is making the next iPad the best iPad it can.</p>
