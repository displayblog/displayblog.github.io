<p>I&#39;m a sucker for simple, elegant design. I&#39;ve not seen that many in <i>any</i> product category. Motorola&#39;s RAZR come to mind as well as Apple&#39;s iPod. Other than that, not that many. LG has come out with something that will hit a cord with those who appreciate simple and elegant designs, the KV6000 mobile phone. The display first: it has a QVGA (320*240) TFT LCD that can display 262,000 colors. Not bad. In addition, it has 512MB of internal memory you can tap into for your MP3 files.
