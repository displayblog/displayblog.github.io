<p>David Robson, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140905-the-women-with-super-human-vision">BBC</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, she knows that this is a symptom of a condition known as &acirc;&euro;&oelig;tetrachromacy&acirc;&euro;. Thanks to a variation in a gene that influences the development of their retinas, people like Antico can see colours invisible to most of us. Consider a pebble pathway. What appears dull grey to you or me shines like a jeweller&acirc;&euro;&trade;s display to Antico. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;The little stones jump out at me with oranges, yellows, greens, blues and pinks,&acirc;&euro; she says. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m kind of shocked when I realise what other people aren&acirc;&euro;&trade;t seeing.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
