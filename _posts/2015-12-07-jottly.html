<p>Jottly, a Bloc.io UX Design project, is an online collaborative text editor. The live version of Jottly is at <a href="http://displayblog.com/jottly/">DISPLAYBLOG.com/jottly</a>. Jottly was the first web page I created from scratch using HTML, CSS, and a&nbsp;tiny bit of JavaScript. The goal of the Jottly landing page was to convince you to try it out by clicking on the I'm In! button at the end.</p>

<p>There are text editors, on-line text editors, and collaborative text-editors. But <em>on-line</em> collaborative text-editors are not common. And the ones that are available are either simple but not powerful enough, or too powerful and&nbsp;complex. I didn't have a lot of good examples that inspired me, so I started out with <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, a popular desktop text editor&nbsp;that was introduced to me when I was in the Full Stack apprenticeship at Bloc for three months, before I shifted to UX Design. Another text editor gaining popularity is <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>.</p>
<p><em>Personas</em></p>
<p>Before I get into the nitty-gritty of how the UI and UX were designed, I'd like to start from the very beginning. Thinking back -- it was about&nbsp;8 months ago&nbsp;and my long term memory can&nbsp;definitely use an upgrade&nbsp;--&nbsp;I believe the first thing I was asked to do was to create personas of those who would be using Jottly, and what for.</p>
<p>First was April Kim; here's her persona profile, created using InDesign:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5737/23595628855_18de2ab847_b.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The purpose of this exercise was to get a good idea of what her needs and goals were and how Jottly can help meet and achieve them, respectively. By the way, in my imaginary Jottly world April Kim is a Senior Editor at Facebook. She leads a team of seven -- located all over the globe --&nbsp;who update Facebook's Newsroom page. I created two more personas and their profiles: Jack Sato, an Aikido Instructure, and Terry Park, a Developer at IDEO. Jack is not terribly computer savvy but uses Jottly to keep track of his students and how they are doing; he uses Jottly as a journal. Terry is a hard core programmer and needs Jottly to be powerful, just as powerful if not more than Sublime Text or Atom, but also similar so as to not require a steep learning curve. At this point I was thinking Jottly will need to be both simple and powerful. The persona idea is a powerful one and helps put myself in the shoes of those who will be using the websites and mobile apps that I design.</p>
<p><em>Icon Design</em></p>
<p>Next I'd like to share how the Jottly icon was designed.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5676/22968933993_8246584559_b.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Jason, my mentor, encouraged me to come up with as many logo designs as possible. So I did just that. I took great liberty to copy many existing logo designs for word processors, text editors, and the like. Take a closer look at the one on the bottom right: that should remind you of Sublime Text's icon.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5804/23569957406_ec5279fe61_b.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>This page is filled with icon designs centered around the idea of incorporating writing tools (pencils, pens, fountain pens) and using the first letter of Jottly.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/664/23487443272_b35f80911b_b.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I took the letter 'J' and played around with it some more.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/652/22968930673_1e2dff1575_b.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Here's some more designs incorporating the shape of writing tools. The one in the middle is a stylized 'J'.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5723/23513595251_b2da620bca_b.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I wanted to see how things would look like with a 3D perspective, compartmentalizing a circle, and making the letter 'J' blocky simple.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5752/23513918071_eb4a0a97f3_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>This, created using Illustrator,&nbsp;ended up being the final design. Similar to what I wanted the web application itself to be the icon here is simple. The letter 'J' -- for Jottly, or a writing tool if using copious amounts of imagination -- leads a line, which can be thought of as a line of text. To soften the sharp edges of the letter&nbsp;'J' and the following line, tight radius corners were used.</p>
<p><em>User Interface Design</em></p>
<p>What better way to convince the web app is worth your time to try out than to show the web app itself? That's what Sublime Text and Atom do: the UI is right there front and center. Sublime Text nicely animates the UI. I wanted to do that too. I did, but the challenge was that it was not responsive to different page widths, and neither is the animation on Sublime Text. I decided responsiveness was more important. So instead of animations I chose a few choice images. These images are in SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format. Resize the browser window and the UI images -- along with all other elements including the icon and text -- should respond accordingly. A quick geeky note: viewports (vw, vh) were used instead of px or em to maximize text size responsiveness.&nbsp;Check it out at <a href="http://displayblog.com/jottly/">DISPLAYBLOG.com/jottly</a>.</p>

<p>I took design cues from multiple sources. The tabs were from web browsers. The right- and down-facing triangles to open folders were borrowed from Apple's operating system, as were the + button to create a new folder or document.</p>
<p>At first the text editing portion of the UI was blank and filled with Lorem Ipsum gibberish. I thought that was a waste of an opportunity for something more useful&nbsp;and decided to put in descriptions and instructions in there instead.</p>
<p><em>Testimonials</em></p>
<p>I went back to my three personas -- April, Jack, and Terry -- for my testimonials. Before this project I didn't think much of testimonials, but I learned they are powerful. Testimonials connect you to those who are already using the product. I code a little and journal too, so I connect to what Jack (journal)&nbsp;and Terry (code) have to say.</p>
<p><em>Call To Action</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5811/22969639253_23635be82f_o.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I stuck with the three words --&nbsp;Write, Share, and Collaborate -- throughout the landing page. I've read on multiple occasions that repetition helps with memory.</p>
<p>Many signup forms require your name, email address, and some form of agreement to a bunch of terms and conditions by way of clicking a button. I think that's an unnecessary hurdle for testing out a web app. So I got rid of all of that and required the one piece of information I thought was essential: your name. Your name would be used throughout the user interface to make the experience yours. I would ask for additional information -- such as your email address and password -- if you decided to save your work on Jottly.</p>
<p>This is where the rubber meets the road: have I successfully persuaded you to click on the I'm In button to try Jottly? If you haven't already, hop on over to <a href="http://displayblog.com/jottly/">DISPLAYBLOG.com/jottly</a> and let me know if I have. Or not.</p>
