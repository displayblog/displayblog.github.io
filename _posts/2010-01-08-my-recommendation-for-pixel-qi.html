<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/08/pixelqi-screens-to-be-used-by-major-manufacturer-in-2010/">Engadget</a>: Pixel Qi has a brilliant LCD technology that allows you to completely turn off the backlight and use it in reflective mode. Benefits? Low power consumption compared to other LCDs and much faster response times compared to E Ink. Yes, Pixel Qi's 3Qi LCD technology is perfect for portable devices that require long battery life and excellent response. But one thing must change.</p>
<p>In most every review of some tablet or another the biggest disappointment is the viewing angle. This tells me that there is no one that has really thought through what type of experience a portable reading device should provide. If a user cannot see text in portrait mode compared to when it is landscape the product is a complete failure. Even the iPhone isn't perfect though the 3.5-inch is quite a bit better than almost all other mobile phones (smartphones, superphones, etc.) at most angles. Pixel Qi has the same problem: viewing angles are terrible. So, why is it terrible?</p>
<p>TN. Twisted Nematic. That's the type of LCD that is cheapest to manufacturer. And in this case you do get what you pay for: terrible viewing angles. Nearly all notebook PCs make use of TN-type LCDs and nearly all of them have terrible viewing angles. LCD monitors except for those that use PVA and IPS panels suck too. Same thing applies to TVs. If Pixel Qi wants to succeed in providing a solid viewing/reading experience on its 3Qi LCDs, I strongly recommend the company working with either Samsung (PVA) or LG Display (IPS). My preference, if you have been reading this blog long enough, is without question IPS. Just look at how beautiful Apple's new 27-inch iMac is. Simply gorgeous! Combine 3Qi and IPS and you've got a one-two punch that would knock out any thing out there right now.</p>
<p>Pixel Qi grafted a 3Qi LCD into a Lenovo IdeaPad S10 and showcased it during CES 2010. Next to a Kindle the 3Qi LCD looks quite nice with the backlight off. Just imagine not having to wait a second to turn the page when reading, being able to playback video, and doing pretty much what you'd expect to do on a regular LCD without having to worry about battery life if you want to hunker down and finish off the last 100 pages of <em>Outliers</em>. BTW, I'm rereading this excellent book!</p>
