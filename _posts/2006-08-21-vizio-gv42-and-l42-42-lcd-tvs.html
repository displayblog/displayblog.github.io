<p>The GV42 42" LCD TV has a 1366 x 768 resolution, 1600:1 contrast ratio (probably "active" not discreet), 8ms response time and a $1600 price tag. You'll need a CostCo card to get it. If you don't have a CostCo card but a Sam's Club card instead, you can get a very similar L42. Vizio's L42 has  the same features but lacks a chip to enhance the contrast ratio and stays put at 800:1. But you save $100 since the L42 is only $1500 at Sam's. Both have 178-degree viewing angles as well.</p>
<p>Table stands are a rip. We all know that and Vizio is nice enough to include one with the price. But like I've said many times before, why go so big if you don't have the pixels to fill it with. Wait for 1080p. Your PS3 will thank you.</p>
