<p><a href="http://www.chimei-innolux.com/opencms/cmo/modules/news/IRNews/irnews_0126.html?__locale=en">Chimei Innolux</a> (CMI) announced March 2011 unaudited revenues of NT$46.6 billion, up 24.7% M/M. Large-area LCD unit shipments increased 19.8% M/M to 11.7 million; small/medium unit shipments were up 28.5% M/M to 37.7 million.</p>
<p>For the first quarter in 2011, revenues decreased 4.6% Q/Q to NT$124 billion. Large-area unit shipments also decreased 4.1% Q/Q to 33.6 million units. Small/medium unit shipments for the quarter also decreased, by 17.6% Q/Q, to 101 million. Unit shipments are meaningless unless average diagonal sizes are included and the most meaningful metric for a LCD manufacturer would be area shipments, which is used by LG Display.</p>
<p>It seems LCD shipments for CMI turned up in the last month of the first quarter, which is generally a weak quarter for many LCD suppliers. However with <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/04/11/hitachi-displays-hdp-taps-chimei-innolux-cmi-for-ips-lcd-production-for-smartphones/">Hitachi Displays tapping CMI to manufacturer small IPS LCDs</a> for smartphones, CMI will get a small boost in both small/medium unit shipments and revenues going forward.</p>
