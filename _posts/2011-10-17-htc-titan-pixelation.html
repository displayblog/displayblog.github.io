<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/17/htc-titan-review/">Engadget</a>: 4.7-inch, 800x480, 198 ppi. Pixels are visible on text and graphics. This isn't HTC's fault: Microsoft requires 800x480 on Windows Phones. Pixelation in a world of 326-ppi iPhones is not competitive. Viewing angles are good though with rich colors and deep blacks.</p>
