<p>ViewSonic's VP2655wb is part of the company's "Pro Series" of LCD monitors. There is the 19-inch VP905b and the 23-inch VP2365wb. Joining the two is the larger 25.5-inch VP2655wb sporting a proper 16:10 IPS TFT LCD with a 1920 x 1200 pixel format. Static contrast ratio of 1000:1 is quite good while the viewing angles at greater than 10:1 contrast ratio of 178/178 is excellent. Brightness at 400 cd/m2 is about 30% brighter than average LCD monitors. I'm glad ViewSonic decided to use an anti-glare LCD for its VP2655wb Pro Series LCD monitor. Connectivity options include VGA, DVI and a 4-port USB hub. Finally, ViewSonic is touting its 118% NTSC wide color gamut: make sure to use a hardware color calibration tool to match your the hardware/software in your workflow. The MSRP of US$1299 is expensive but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002R0JJYY?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=displ0f-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002R0JJYY">Amazon</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=displ0f-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B002R0JJYY" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> has it for $978.99 as of this writing. The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/08/06/database-ips-lcd-monitor/">IPS LCD Monitor Database</a> has been updated with this model.
