<blockquote><p>Despite weak demand in the LCD TV market due to the increasing popularity of smartphones and tablet PCs, the traditional boom season in the third quarter should help panel makers such as LG Display and AU Optronics (AUO) increase capacity utilization rates sequentially. Market watchers predict South Korea-based panel firms are likely to turn profits in the third quarter.</blockquote></p>
<p>Due to inventory concerns, LG Display decreased its overall capacity utilization to 70% in July, while AUO dropped to 80%. Third quarter capacity utilization rates usually increase in anticipation of large fourth quarter demand for LCD goods, primarily TVs.</p>
