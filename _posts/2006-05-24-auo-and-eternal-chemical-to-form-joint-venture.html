<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/displays/a20060522A6031.html">DigiTimes</a>: On May 19, Eternal Chemical based in Taiwan announced that it will form a joint venture with AUO to develop components for LCD production. AUO will form this joint venture through its Konly Venture Corporation affiliate with each claiming 45% stake. AUO's BOD has not approved this joint venture as of yet. Eternal has a division that provides photoresist materials and optical films. Photoresist is a process to manufacture color filters (CF). With CF costs a large portion of the cost of LCDs, many are researching ways to completely eliminate CFs or to reduce the cost.</p>
<p>AUO has made several investments to vertically integrate some key components to LCD manufacture. For CCFLs, Wellypower has been tapped with a 10% stake. AUO has a subsidiary called Raydium Semiconductor that provides driver ICs. Daxon Technology, a member of the BenQ Group provides polarizers. Another BenQ Group member, Darfon Electronics, provides inverters to AUO. AUO also has a 28% stake in Cando, a supplier of CFs.</p>
