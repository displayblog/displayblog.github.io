<p><a href="http://www.ubergizmo.com/15/archives/2008/10/samsung_spf71e_digital_photo_frame.html">Ubergizmo</a>: The Samsung SPF-71E is a 7" digital photo frame. Although <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">all the some blogs out there are stating a 4:3 aspect ratio, I'm going to trust my eyes and call it as I see it: IT IS WIDE. The 7" digital photo frame should have a pixel format of 800x480. Or it could have the lower pixel format of 480x234, but that would be really low. The brightness is 200 cd/m2 and has a contrast ratio of 500:1. There is some internal memory (120MB) and a SD port. Two colors are available: white and pink. Otherwise, there doesn't seem to be anything that's really special. Except for the price: just $100.</p>
