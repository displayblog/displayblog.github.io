<p>In a couple of days, SID 2006 attendees will be able to experience the 100" LCD TV panel manufactured by LG.Philips LCD. It is the largest LCD panel in the world and was developed back in March but has not been introduced to the public. It is built on LPL&#39;s G7 fab with a motherglass dimension of 1950 x 2200, or something like that. The panel boasts 6.22 million pixels and has a response time of 5ms. With the total number of colors at 1.07 billion, the colors will be quite brilliant, though the human visual system is limited to the millions-range. Contrast ratio is at 3000:1.</p>
