<p>Are you often outside in the sun with not-enough battery power on your <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=macbook&amp;sa=Search#1348">MacBook</a>? QuickerTek Inc. has a solution for you: Apple Juicz, a solar charger. There is a US$700 27 Watt model and a 55 Watt one that costs $1200. Quite expensive. It takes some time to charge your MacBook from as little as 6 hours to as much as 12. If you absolutely need to recharge your MacBook and you're far <em>far</em> away from a power outlet, maybe the Apple Juicz can help.
