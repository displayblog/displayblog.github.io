<p>Chunghwa Picture Tubes (CPT)... BTW, what a weird name that is: Picture Tubes? The world is going flat and tubes are going out the window. Anyway, CPT acquired a 22% stake in Sintronic Technology. Sintronic is a CCFL manufacturer that produces cold-cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs). CPT paid about $9 million through it&#39;s wholly-owned subsidiary Grand Cathay Optronics, making CPT the largest shareholder of Sintronic. That makes sense since CPT is Sintronic&#39;s largest customer.</p>
<p>Why is CCFL so important? It takes 16 CCFL lamps to luminate a 32" LCD TV. That&#39;s a lot more than the 2 you need to light up a LCD monitor or just one for a NBPC. With LCD TV shipments expected to continue growing by another 20 million+ this year, many folks have talked about the possibility of a CCFL shortage and in some cases high-quality CCFLs with U- or S-shapes are in short supply as they reduce the number of CCFLs needed leading to a reduction of cost. High-quality CCFLs generate more color gamut from the average CCFL&#39;s 72% NTSC to almost 80% NTSC buy using better phosphor coatings. So, CPT is making a smart move that cost them only $9 million to secure any CCFLs they might need.&nbsp;</p>
