<p><a href="http://en.expreview.com/2011/03/18/samsung-unveils-27-inch-monitor-with-ultra-wide-band-tech/15446.html">EXPreview</a>: The Samsung SyncMaster C27A750 is a 27-inch wireless LCD monitor that makes use of Ultra Wide Band (UWB). Unfortunately the large 27-inch LCD packs only 1920x1080 pixels. You would think a 27-inch LCD would sport a pixel format of 2560x1440. Connectivity options include HDMI, VGA, two USB 2.0, and two USB 3.0 ports. The rather nicely designed C27A750 is priced at &acirc;&sbquo;&not;600 and is expected to be available at the end of April in Europe.</p>
