<p>Tim Cook took a few minutes to share "The State Of The Mac". The Mac is doing really well.</p>
<p><em>iLife '11</em><br />
Same five apps, but updated. Demos three.</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhoto '11: New full screen modes, Facebook enhancements, Emailing photos, New slideshows (very cool), Big leap in books, Letterpress cards. I wonder if there's a letterpress business card option.</li>
<li>iMovie '11: All new audio editing, One step effects, People finder, News and sports themes, Movie trailers.</li>
<li>GarageBand '11: Flex Time, Groove Matching, More guitar amps & effects, New piano & guitar lessons, "How Did I Play?" Five million people use Garageband to make music.</li><br />
</ul><br />
Free with every new Mac. $49 upgrade. Available today.</p>
<p><em>FaceTime</em><br />
Began with iPhone 4. Then iPod touch got it. Now FaceTime comes to the Mac: Mac-iPhone 4-iPod touch. Automatic re-orientation of iPhone 4 & iPod touch in portrait and landscape. Beta release available today on Apple.com.</p>
<p><em>Mac OS X</em><br />
Lion: OS X meets the iPad. Summer 2011.</p>
<p>Jobs:</p>
<blockquote><p>We're making it very simple.</blockquote></p>
<p>What we learned from the iPad: Multi-Touch gestures, App Store, App Home screens, Full screen apps, Auto save, Apps resume when launched.</p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-touch gestures: Touch surfaces don't want to be vertical. Ergonomically terrible. Touch surfaces want to be horizontal. Trackpad (built-in, standalone) and the Magic Mouse. Not on the display.</li>
<li>Mac App Store: Best place to discover apps, One-click downloads, Free & paid apps (70/30 split), Automatic installation, Automatic app updates, Apps licensed for use on all your personal Macs. Will open within 90 days. Apple will be accepting apps starting November. Looks quite a bit like the iTunes Music Store: simple, easy to navigate, purchase, and install. By the way, you don't need to install. It auto-installs just like the apps on the iPhone and iPad.</li>
<li>Launchpad: Home screens for Mac. A full-screen grid of all the apps. And there are multiple full-screen pages by gesturing, just like on iDevices. Folders too. Excellent.</li>
<li>Full Screen Apps: The green dot zooms some apps into full screen mode.</li>
<li>Mission Control: Combines Expose, Full screen apps, Dashboard, Spaces.</li><br />
</ul></p>
