<p><a href="http://www.displaymate.com/OLED_Tablet_ShootOut_1.htm">Raymond Soneira</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Based on our extensive Lab tests and measurements, the Galaxy Tab S is the Best Performing Tablet Display that we have ever tested, not surprisingly with performance that is almost identical to the <a href="http://www.displaymate.com/Galaxy_S5_ShootOut_1.htm">OLED Galaxy S5 Smartphone</a> that we recently tested and found to be the Best Performing Smartphone Display. The Galaxy Tab S establishes new records for best Tablet display performance in: Highest Color Accuracy, Infinite Contrast Ratio, Lowest Screen Reflectance, and smallest Brightness Variation with Viewing Angle. Both Galaxy Tab S models offer Quad HD 2560x1600 pixel displays (with 287 to 361 pixels per inch), currently the highest for Tablets, with 4.1 Mega Pixels, double the number on your HDTV. Where the Galaxy Tab S does very well but does not break performance records is in maximum display Brightness &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; the current record holder for Tablets is the Nokia Lumia 2520 with 684 nits, while the Tab S has 546 nits with Automatic Brightness On and 415 nits under manual Brightness (10 percent lower for mixed content with 50 percent Average Picture Level APL and 25 percent lower for an all white screen). High screen Brightness is only needed for High Ambient Light, so turning Automatic Brightness On will provide better screen visibility and also a longer battery running time. Its record low Screen Reflectance of 4.7 percent further improves the effective screen Brightness, resulting in a very high Contrast Rating for High Ambient Light with Automatic Brightness On.</blockquote></p>
<p>The OLED display incorporated in the Samsung Galaxy Tab S displaces the Amazon Kindle Fire HDX as the top performing tablet display. The 9.7-inch IPS LCD used in the iPad Air is bumped down to number three.</p>
