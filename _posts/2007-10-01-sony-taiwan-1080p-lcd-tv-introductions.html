<p>On 2007.09.29, <strong>Sony Taiwan</strong> introduced two 1080p LCD TVs series: X and W with three different sizes for each series: 40", 46" and 52" that will be available in October. The 52" (KDL-52X3500) will cost NT$219,000 (US$6719) and the 40" (KDL-40W3100) will be NT$74,900 (US$2297). Sony expects total demand for LCD TVs in Taiwan to reach 700,000 units in 2007. </p>
<p><strong>Sharp</strong>'s 42" Full HD LCD TV is priced at NT$109,000, significantly higher than Sony's KDL-40W3100, by NT$34,100, even compensating for the extra 2" in size.&Acirc;&nbsp; Competitors have announced that they will not enter into a price war in the short term with Sony. This will most likely lead to Sony capturing a significant amount of market share. Not only does Sony have a strong brand presence worldwide, when Sony's TVs can be had for substantially less, the decision would be quite simple, in my opinion.</p>
