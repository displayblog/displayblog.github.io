<blockquote><p>.. if Apple is doing an end run around the carrier by putting its own SIM inside the iPhone, it could do what Google with its NexusOne could not, which is create an easy way to sell a handset via the web without carrier involvement. Much like it helped cut operators out of the app store game, Apple could be taking them out of the device retail game.</blockquote></p>
<p>Here's the rumor: Apple and Gemalto are working on a special SIM embedded directly into an iPhone. Get the iPhone from an Apple Store, retail or online, choose your carrier and off you go. Carrier need not get involved.</p>
