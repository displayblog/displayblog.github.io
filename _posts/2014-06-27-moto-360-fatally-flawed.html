<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/25/5843028/up-close-with-the-moto-360-the-best-looking-smartwatch-yet">David Pierce, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The 360 has a big, round screen that goes completely edge to edge except for one small cutout at the bottom &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; that's where the display drivers are, I'm told, and it was essentially an unavoidable design oddity.</blockquote></p>
<p>It's not small. It's not perfectly round. And it's an ugly permanent reminder of both.</p>
