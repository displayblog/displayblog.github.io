<p>Naturally, I'll be focusing on the display portion of the reviews.</p>
<p><a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/laptops/hp-mini-210-hd/4505-3121_7-33939694.html#reviewPage1">cnet</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The 10.1-inch wide-screen display offers a 1,366x768-pixel native resolution, which is becoming more common over traditional 1,024x768-pixel versions. The higher resolution makes sense if you're going to using the built-in HD video processing hardware to watch HD video, and we just generally like having a little more pixel real estate on the screen. We also like the slick look of the edge-to-edge glass over the entire display, even if it makes the surface even glossier and more reflective than usual.</blockquote></p>
<p>1024x768? I have never seen this pixel format on a netbook. The iPad on the other hand. cnet probably meant to say 1024x600. The glass cover protects the LCD and makes it look cool, but it adds weight and there is an air gap between the cover glass and LCD. If dust gets trapped in there, there is no way to get it out.</p>

<blockquote><p>The display on the HP Mini 210 that we reviewed performed well. The 1366 x 768 resolution provided enough room to work on two documents side by side and the screen was able to go bright enough to satisfy my needs. Unfortunately the display is glossy, which means using it outdoors or in some bright lighting situations can be a pain. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not the glossiest display I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve used and if you don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t plan to use the Mini 210 outdoors it may not be an issue for you.</blockquote></p>
<p>Two documents side-by-side? You must be joking! Each document will only have 683x768 pixels. I don't think this is workable. I would recommend 1920x1200 or 1920x1080 if you're thinking about working on two documents side-by-side. And glossy <em>will</em> be an issue if there are sources of bright light behind you.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2358269,00.asp">PCMag</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The 10.1 inch LED backlit display has a maximum resolution of 1024 by 600 pixels. The panel is covered with an edge-to-edge, anti-glare coating that helps deliver a sharp picture with bright, bold colors, but as with most glossy treatments, it tends to reflect ambient light. Viewing angle performance is quite good for such a small screen, although colors do lose a little luster when viewed from an extreme side angle.</blockquote></p>
<p>Maximum pixel format is 1366x768 on the HP Mini 210. Also, viewing angle performance doesn't depend on display size: don't expect poor viewing angles as display size gets smaller. You should expect good viewing angles regardless of size.</p>
<p><a href="http://review.techworld.com/personal-tech/3214558/hp-mini-210-review/">TechWorld</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The screen has a native resolution of 1024x600 and it's bright enough to use outdoors and indoors with the lights on. It has a glossy plastic pane that extends from edge to edge. This will reflect light, which will possibly infuriate you while you try to view photos and videos.</blockquote></p>
<p>I recommend getting the Mini 210 with 1366x768. And no, it isn't bright enough to use outdoors. Unfortunately, there are very few netbooks you can buy without a glossy display.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/02/25/hp-mini-210-hd-edition-review/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Mini 210's 10.1-inch screen's flush bezel makes the 1366 x 768 resolution display look higher class than most other netbooks, but while colors look bright and the extra pixels make 720p content look crisp, the glossy coating is extremely reflective. Vertical viewing angles good enough when the screen was tilted back, but horizontal viewing angles were quite horrendous. [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>Viewing angles are terrible so plan on using the Mini 210 all by yourself. If you're okay with the 1024x600 version of the Mini 210 netbook, Amazon sells it for US$339.90. I recommend the Mini 210 with 1366x768, so search for "Mini 210 HD," but I'm having a hard time finding these.</p>
