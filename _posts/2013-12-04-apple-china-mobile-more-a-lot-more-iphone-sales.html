<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/4/5176722/apple-signs-china-mobile-deal-wsj">The Verge</a>. According to <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303722104579238851680806982">The Wall Street Journal</a>, Apple signed an agreement with China Mobile, the world's largest carrier. Apple's iPhone 5c and 5s already supports China Mobile&acirc;&euro;&trade;s proprietary TD-LTE network and are expected to be available later this month. I wonder which of the two &mdash; the company behind the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s most popular smartphone versus the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s largest carrier &mdash; gained the upper hand. My guess: Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s overall profits will soar, but profit margins will drop.</p>
