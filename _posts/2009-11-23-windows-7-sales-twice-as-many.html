<p>Steve Ballmer is excited. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=windows+7&amp;sa=Search#1348">Windows 7</a> sales in its first few weeks, starting October 22, are double that of any previous version. No specific numbers were shared but Vista sold 20 million copies in its first month. Windows 7, including boxed copies and ones included in PCs, might be in a run for 40 million. This is a big deal since OS profits make up almost 50% of Microsoft's total profits. Putting Vista behind will be cathartic as well.
