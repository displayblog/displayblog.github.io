Here is an update to Mitsubishi's laser-based rear projection TV (RPTV). As you can see in the picture below, Mitsubishi has done a tremendous job of making a 10" thick RPTV look quite sexy and very desirable. There are other factors that might warrant a closer look especially in light of current economic conditions.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/mitsubishi_laservue_02.jpg" alt="Mitsubishi LaserVue: Laser TV" /></p>
<p>Mitsubishi's LaserVue RPTV will come in two sizes: 65" and 73". These RPTVs that sport leading edge lasers as light sources instead of the conventional UHP or more advanced LEDs will be up for grabs in Q3'08. Here are some specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Color Gamut: 200% NTSC</li>
<li>Frequency: 120Hz</li>
<li>Brightness: 500 cd/m2</li>
<li>Power Consumption: 200W</li><br />
</ul><br />
The 200W power consumption is just half of comparably sized LCD TVs and one third of plasma TVs. The 200% NTSC is amazing and the laser light source will probably have a very long life time and will decrease in brightness much slower than LED and much MUCH slower than UHP. Prices are expected to be commensurate to similarly sized LCD TVs and plasma TVs, so I'm guessing in a world where every penny counts and energy consumption is a very big concern, Mitsubishi has timed the LaserVue's introduction quite well.

<p><strong>Original Post</strong><br />
Mitsubishi's laser TV has a name: LaserVue. The company will start selling the laser illuminated rear projection TV (RPTV) in Q3'08. That's as early as July. This is according to those who attended Mitsubishi's event to introduce its new HDTV products on April 4. Art Berman, Insight Media consultant, reports that color is one big advantage of Mitsubishi's LaserVue.</p>
<p>
Mitsubishi's LaserVue TV was sandwiched between a comparably-sized Sharp LCD TV and a Pioneer plasma TV. Berman noted that the red content on the LaserVue was "so intensely red that it made the reds in the LCD and plasma look distinctly orange." He also noted that black levels were much darker than the LCD or plasma. On the other hand, the LaserVue had relatively less uniformity when a "white field of view flashed across the screen." This might be a concern for some who usually watch shows that are bright or for those who will be connecting game consoles such as the PS3 or XB360.<br />
</p>
<p>
Mitsubishi is claiming that its LaserVue RPTV consumes less than 50% of an equivalent sized LCD or plasma TV. This is characteristic of RPTVs in general, but it is good to know that a laser-based light source does not consume more power than one that is based on UHP or LED. In the looks department, the LaserVue RPTV had a bezel that was less than 1" thick. But whether the LaserVue RPTV will become a success has much to do with price. Unfortunately, Berman reported that Mitsubishi's LaserVue RPTV will have a premium price.<br />
</p>
<p>
I am not sure how much of a premium this is, but my guess is that the LaserVue RPTV will have to be at most equal to the price of comparably-sized LCD and plasma TVs; most likely considerably cheaper to achieve success. Color is definitely important, but with our current economy, consumers will most likely purchase TVs that they can afford, and that is getting smaller and cheaper than before.<br />
