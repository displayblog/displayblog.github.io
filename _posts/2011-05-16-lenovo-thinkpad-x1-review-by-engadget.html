<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/16/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-review/">Dana Wollman</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As we said, the X1 has a 13.3-inch, 350-nit display fashioned out of edge-to-edge Gorilla Glass. We think that scratch-resistant panel is a brilliant addition, and hope more notebook makers start incorporating it. The one trade-off, though, is that in adopting Gorilla Glass, Lenovo traded a matte, easily viewable display for a highly reflective one. The screen is glossy in a way that's likely to irk and disappoint a lot of people -- not least among them, ThinkPad loyalists. While we were watching a movie, the screen was too reflective from the sides, and appeared washed out when we viewed it head-on, with the lid pushed down. Worse, it'll pick up fingerprints just from you opening and closing the lid.</p>
<p>To Lenovo's credit, of course, it appears to have opted for a reflective panel for the sake of durability -- a noble cause if ever there was one. In other words, there's no evidence its design team jumped on the glossy-is-sexier bandwagon. Unfortunately, the X1's resolution is limited to 1366 x 768. It's a shame, especially since the X301 was offered with a 1440 x 900 option. The X1's pixel count will be sufficient for web surfing and word processing, but it's disapointing that the company would cut the pixels on a laptop it hopes will be sexy and versatile enough to strike a chord beyond the boardroom.</blockquote></p>
<p>The ThinkPad X1 is a premium ultra-slim and ultra-light 13.3-inch notebook PC and has the Apple 13.3-inch MacBook Air as one of its targets. But the strange decision by Lenovo to limit the pixel format on the X1 to just 1366x768 make it less competitive to Apple's offering that has moved on to 1440x900. As Wollman mentioned the X300 series had the higher resolution option.</p>
<p>The Gorilla Glass option on regular notebooks don't make sense to me. What value does it provide? We don't touch the display all that much to warrant protecting it. The keyboard scratching the display? That's easy: just make sure the display doesn't touch the keys. Gorilla Glass not only adds reflections it adds two additional things that go against the goal of building a thin and light notebook PC. The 15-inch or larger Gorilla Glass tough thin adds thickness. And weight. There is also an air gap between the cover glass and the actual LCD that can be the source of visual annoyance.</p>
