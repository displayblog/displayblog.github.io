<em>"One has to use the brakes..."<br />
KY Lee, Chairman, AUO</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=au-optronics">AU Optronics</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=auo">AUO</a>), the largest LCD manufacturer in Taiwan, has announced that it will delay the construction of two LCD fabrication plants by at least six months. AUO was originally planning to commence construction of the buildings for its <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=g10">G10</a> and G11 LCD fabs in July 2009. Pushing that out by at least six months brings down CAPEX for 2009 to about zero. Chairman Kuen-Yao (KY) Lee stated admitted that, "One has to use the brakes and slow down a bit on a downhill path." Right he is the road is downward and it is quite slippery: this is a good time to use those brakes.</p>
