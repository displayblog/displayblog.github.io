<p>On April 23, 2008, Merck, a pharmaceutical and chemical company based in Germany, announced net profits of &acirc;&sbquo;&not;239.1 million in Q1'08 after posting a loss of &acirc;&sbquo;&not;8.3 million (US$13.2 million) a year earlier. The Q1'07 loss was mostly due to high interest payments on debt and Serono acquisition-related write-downs. Growth was driven by all divisions according to the company. Merck expects 2008 revenues to increase 5% to 9% while operating margin is expected to be in the range of 23% to 27%.</p>
<p>Merck forecasts 5% to 10% revenue growth and 47% to 52% operating margin in its liquid crystals division in 2008. Operating margins in the 50% range is incredibly strong. Merck has a dominant position in the liquid crystal market with about a 65% market share due to its very popular liquid crystals for both vertical alignment (VA) and in-plane switching (IPS). Merck's closest competitor is Chisso of Japan. Merck's market position is strong because its liquid crystals leads in performance and that's what is required in a fast growing segment: LCD TVs. </p>
<p><em>Update 2008.04.30</em><br />
VA liquid crystals are used by companies such as Samsung, Sharp, AU Optronics (AUO), Chi Mei Optoelectronics (CMO) while IPS liquid crystals are used by LG Display, IPS Alpha, Hitachi and a couple of others.</p>
