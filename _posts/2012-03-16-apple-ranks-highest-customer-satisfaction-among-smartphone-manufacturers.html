<blockquote><p>For a seventh consecutive time, Apple ranks highest among manufacturers of smartphones in customer satisfaction. Apple achieves a score of 839 on a 1,000-point scale and performs well in all factors, particularly in ease of operation and features. HTC (798) follows Apple in the smartphone rankings. </p>
<p>LG and Sanyo rank highest in overall customer satisfaction with traditional handsets, in a tie (716 each). LG performs well in all four factors, while Sanyo performs particularly well in ease of operation.</blockquote></p>
<p>We respond to products and services that are easy to use. If more effort went into making things easier to use rather than on improving technical specifications just to have an updated version many brands would be in better shape.</p>
