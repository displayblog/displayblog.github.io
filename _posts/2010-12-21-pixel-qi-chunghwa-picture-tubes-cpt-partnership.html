<p><a href="http://pixelqi.com/blog1/2010/12/21/pixel-qi-and-cpt-announce-manufacturing-partnership/">Mary Lou Jepsen</a> at Pixel Qi:</p>
<blockquote><p>This alliance started early last summer when CPT showed a transflective screen of its own design at a Taiwanese trade show. Discussions between the two companies at that show made it apparent that Pixel Qi and CPT should work together to bring stronger product to market faster. A close alliance was formed and the teams have been working together quietly all fall. They have created samples of a 7&acirc;&euro;¬ù 1024&Atilde;&mdash;600 screens scheduled for mass production in early Q2 2011, which will be first publically shown at the CES 2011 exhibition in Las Vegas in early January 2011.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Pixel Qi-infused CPT 7-inch transflective LCDs are most likely targeted for tablets. If so, I would recommend quickly moving to 1280x800 as Gingerbread and Honeycomb will be supporting this pixel format. High-end Android tablets in 2011 will probably sport LCDs with 1280x800 instead of 1024x600.</p>
