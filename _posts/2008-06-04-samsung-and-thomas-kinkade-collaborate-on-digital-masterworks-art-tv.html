<p>On June 3, 2008, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=samsung">Samsung</a> Electronics held a press event at the San Francisco Asian Art Museum. Samsung collaborated with The Thomas Kinkade Company to develop a prototype <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a> that combines technology with art. The exhibit had a very nice frame and according to Linda Mariano, VP Marketing and Licensing, the same quality of frame is used for the real non-digital versions of Thomas Kinkade's paintings.</p>

<p>The quality of the art work that was being shown on Samsung's 46" LCD TV was superb. The texture of the digital art looked as though quite real.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="http://crave.cnet.com/8301-1_105-9959308-1.html">CNET article posted by Erica Ogg</a>, there are plans for touch capability to manipulate the lighting or colors of the artwork. That might be fun, but I hope there is a "Back to Original" button since I'm going to guess that Thomas Kinkade is a much better painter than most. Thomas Kinkade has also digitally created original art that matches the LCD's aspect ratio of 16:9.</p>
