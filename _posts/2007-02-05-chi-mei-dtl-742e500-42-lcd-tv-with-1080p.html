<p>Chi Mei's DTL-742E500 is a 42" LCD TV with a pixel format of 1920 x 1080 that enables it to display Full HD or 1080p content. The DTL-742E500 is currently shipping in Taiwan and Europe with a US rollout in the second quarter of 2007. A Faroudja DCDi scaler is used for the 42" LCD TV that should enhance the front screen performance when the video source is less than 1080p, which is pretty much everything except for movies in Blu-ray format, PlayStation 3 games, and 1080p content piped via your PC.</p>

<p>Of course, Chi Mei procured its LCD TV panel from its subsidiary Chi Mei Optoelectronics (CMO). CMO is the second-largest LCD manufacturer in Taiwan behind AU Optronics (AUO). The LCD TV panel features a 1200:1 contrast ratio, a brightness of 500 cd/m2, viewing angles of 176 degrees, and a response time of 6.5ms. There are two HDMI inputs and then the price. And the price is a very affordable $1665. Incredible.</p>
