<p>Toshiba's TB62750FTG, a white LED driver IC, incorporates over-voltage protection and thermal shutdown functions resulting in power-efficiencies of 80% enabling longer battery life for mobile applications. Also, the TB62750FTG Step-Up DC-DC Converter combines over-voltage protection, high-precision current regulation (+/-2% of target value) and power-efficiency with an optimized circuit design that minimizes the size enabling small footprint devices. There are two modes that the TB62750FTG can operate in: Light Mode and Flash Mode. Light Mode is ideal for continuous operations and Flash Mode has a higher current of 800mA and a 300ms maximum light time.</p>
