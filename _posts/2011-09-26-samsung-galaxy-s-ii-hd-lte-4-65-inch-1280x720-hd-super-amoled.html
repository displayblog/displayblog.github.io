<p><a href="http://www.samsung.com/sec/news/newsRead.do?news_group=productnews&news_seq=29201">Samsung (Korean)</a>: The Samsung Galaxy S II HD LTE* is the first to sport the company's HD Super AMOLED technology, which packs 1280x720 pixels into the 4.65-inch display for a resolution of 316 ppi. For comparison the 3.5-inch 960x640 Retina Display on the iPhone 4 has a resolution of 326 ppi. Though the Galaxy S II HD LTE comes up a bit short, both can be classified as displays beyond our retinal capabilities when about twelve inches away.</p>
<p>The big question I have regarding the HD Super AMOLED display is whether it sports the Nouvoyance PenTile Matrix sub-pixel structure or the standard RGB-stripe. I was under the impression it was very difficult if not impossible to cram RGB-stripe 1280x720 pixels into a 4.x-inch display. The state-of-the-art for LCD is the 4.5-inch 1280x720 AH-IPS LCD manufactured by LG Display used in the upcoming <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/09/19/lg-lu6200-optimus-lte-4-5-inch-1280x720-ah-ips-lcd/">LG LU6200 Optimus LTE</a>, which packs a resolution of 329 ppi.</p>
<p>According to Samsung the HD Super AMOLED features a 110% color gamut, 180/180-degree viewing angles, and refers to the Galaxy S II HD LTE as, "an HD theater in your hand". An itty bitty HD theater, sure. But I am really excited that the display industry is marching ahead toward high pixel count smartphone displays. 1280x720 is perfect for those who are 720p HD video aficionados. A lot of digital cameras capture 720p and the unscaled 1:1 pixel mapped videos will go a long way in providing a superb 720p HD watching experience.</p>
<p>The 110% color gamut means that colors will pop, but without proper color control those poppin' colors will also be far from accurate. OLED displays have been known to sport wayward colors.</p>
<p>Other specs include: 8 megapixel camera, 1080p HD video playback, TV-out <em>via</em> a Mobile High-Definition Link (MHL) adapter, NFC, WiFi ABGN, Bluetooth 3.0+HS, 9.5-mm thickness, Adobe Flash support. Adobe Flash. Good luck with that. The Samsung Galaxy S II HD LTE will be available on KT, LG U+, and SK Telecom in South Korea.</p>

<p>* That's <em>four</em> suffixes: this could be a world record for the largest number of suffixes on an electronic device!</p>
