<blockquote><p>One detail of the report that bears special attention is the fact that the Ivy Bridge platform, both mobile and desktop, will support up to three independent displays, with one of those displays being an internal one.</blockquote></p>
<p>Intel's mobile CPU roadmap was leaked by <a href="http://vr-zone.com/articles/intel-s-mobile-ivy-bridge-cpu-line-up-revealed/14148.html">VR-Zone</a> earlier today.</p>
