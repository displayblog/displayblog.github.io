<blockquote><p>Based on our extensive Lab tests and measurements, the Galaxy Note 4 is the Best performing Smartphone display that we have ever tested. It matches or breaks new records in Smartphone display performance for: Highest Absolute Color Accuracy, Highest Screen Resolution, Infinite Contrast Ratio, Highest Peak Brightness, Highest Contrast Rating in Ambient Light, and the smallest Brightness Variation with Viewing Angle. Its Color Management capability provides multiple Color Gamuts &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; a major advantage that is not currently provided by any of the other leading Smartphones. The Galaxy Note 4 delivers uniformly consistent all around Top Tier display performance [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>An OLED display is the most color accurate display on a smartphone. Now that's something; OLED has come a long way from the days of overly contrasty and over saturated colors.</p>
<p>The 5.7-inch OLED display sports a pixel format of 2560x1440 good for a resolution of 515 pixels per inch. Compare that to the just announced iPhone 6 Plus: 5.5 inches, 1920x1080, 401 ppi. The iPhone 6 Plus doesn't even come close. It's not about specs? Sure it is, especially when you can see the difference. </p>
<p>There's a lot to like about the OLED display in the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. And that stylus is tempting too.</p>
