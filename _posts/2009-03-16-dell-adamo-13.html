<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/03/17/dell-adamo-announced-1-2ghz-core-2-duo-1-999/">Engadget</a>: Dell has officially announced the first model in its Adamo line of ultra-sexy notebook PCs: Adamo 13. The 13 probably refers to the size of the display, which is 13.4" and the Dell press release states that it is a 16:9 HD display. I'm guessing it's 1366 x 768.&Acirc;&nbsp;As you may already know pictures of Adamo show an extremely well-designed and very thin notebook PC. Up until now the internal specs have not been known. Well, the wait is over and it is a bit of a let down. The CPU is a 1.2GHz Core 2 Duo U9300. Slow. RAM will be 2GB. Okay if you'll be running 32-bit operating systems but the funny thing is that it will be loaded with Vista Home Premium SP1. The 64-bit version. Where's the extra 2GB? The only thing that's kind of worthy of the $1999 price is the 128GB SSD--I hope it's the fast kind. Dell is touting that you can get Adamo by Dell branded color-matched peripherals. TUMI has jumped in with an exclusive line of bags too. Hmm... the Adamo is certainly a sexy notebook, but it's not very powerful.</p>
<p><em>Update 2009.03.17 9:58AM PST</em>: Want a little boost in performance and connectivity? Well for $2699 you can equip the Adamo 13 with a 1.4GHz CPU, 4GB RAM and a built-in 3G card. That's $700 extra! A bit too rich for my taste, although I do like the styling.</p>
