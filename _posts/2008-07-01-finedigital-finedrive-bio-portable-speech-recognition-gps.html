<p>FineDigital has announced a fine GPS device. And I hope others follow suit with voice recognition because it can get a bit stressful poking about trying to get some information from the GPS device while trying to drive. Not recommended. FineDigital's FineDrive Bio GPS unit can be controlled via speech recognition.</p>

<p>The functions are quite a bit for a GPS unit including: Navigation, DMB, Movies, MP3 (top row), Photo Album, Entertainment, External Input, System Settings (bottom row). I'm interested to find out what type of "entertainment" is included with the FineDrive Bio. The 7" wide LCD with a pixel format of 800 x 480 should be enough for a lot of these functions. As you can see from the top picture, you can split navigation and DMB (TV) functions: not legal in the US, but allowed in South Korea. In fact, I've been in several taxis in South Korea with more than a couple LCDs with at least one showing live TV. It was actually pretty cool to get the news while going to work, and not driving myself.</p>
