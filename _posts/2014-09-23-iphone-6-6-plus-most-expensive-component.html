<p>Arik Hesseldahl, <a href="http://recode.net/2014/09/23/teardown-shows-apples-iphone-6-cost-at-least-200-to-build/">Re/code</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The most costly component in both phones is the combined display and touchscreen. The displays come from LG Display and Japan Display, costing $45 on the iPhone 6 and $52.50 on the iPhone 6 Plus. The cost for the smaller 4.7-inch model is only four dollars more than the four-inch display used on the <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130924/teardown-analysis-shows-iphone-5s-costs-at-least-199-to-build-173-for-the-5c/">iPhone 5s</a>.</blockquote></p>
<p>These numbers are merely estimates by a market research company.</p>
