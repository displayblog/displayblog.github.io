The Samsung 2263DX is an interesting concept! The rather normal 22" LCD monitor is tagged along by an additional 7" LCD monitor that has a decent pixel format of 800 x 480. You can use the 7" LCD for anything you'd like such as email notification, video conferencing, instant messaging, etc. The 7" can be located on the left, right or top and is connected via a UbiSync USB connection. Kudos to Samsung for adding a little something extra. Will the additional display improve productivity? We'll see. Maybe it might be used for improved gameplay instead! For instance, if game developers used the extra screen for GPS, status information for engine, robot, self, etc., that might actually improve gameplay. Of course, you'd want to improve the main monitor first since it's really not high-performance.</p>
