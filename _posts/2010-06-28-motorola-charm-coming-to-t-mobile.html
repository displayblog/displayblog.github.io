<p>Motorola's Charm is an unusually wide candybar smartphone. The built-in QWERTY hardware-based keyboard looks to be be quite type-able thanks to its size. Charm runs Android 2.1 and Motorola's UI skin MOTOBLUR with improved Facebook and Twitter integration. I'm not sure what to think about the overall hardware dimensions but it is definitely something refreshing. Ah, yes, now I know: it looks like a Peek. You can find pictures at&Acirc;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/27/motorola-charm-coming-to-t-mobile-with-enhanced-android-2-1-mo/">Engadget</a> and according to the site the Charm from Motorola is headed to T-Mobile.</p>
