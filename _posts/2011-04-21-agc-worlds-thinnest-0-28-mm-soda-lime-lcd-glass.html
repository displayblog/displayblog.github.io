<p><a href="http://www.agc.com/english/news/2011/0421e.pdf">AGC</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>AGC announced today it has developed the world's thinnest soda-lime glass substrate for touchscreens, measuring just 0.28 mm or 15% less than the currently thinnest commercial substrate at 0.33 mm, as well as being 15% lighter, promising to further shrink smartphone and tablets in the near future.</blockquote></p>
<p>AGC uses the float process of manufacturing LCD glass substrates and will begin mass production of this ultra-thin 0.28-mm soda-lime glass later this month.<br /></p>
