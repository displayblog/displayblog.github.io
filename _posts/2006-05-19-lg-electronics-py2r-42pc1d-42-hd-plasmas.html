<p>LGE's PY2R series of plasma TVs in 50" and 60" sizes have won awards for its design from iF Design and Red Dot. These plasmas have LG's XD Engine that improves all aspects of the picture including brightness, contrast, color and signal noise reduction. LG improved upon what was good and made it better by developing a "Clear Filter" that replaces the heavier glass filter. The Clear Filter is made with a thin film and has anti-reflective characteristics in addition to reducing glare and weight. The PY2R has a pixel format of 1366 x 768, what I call true HD in the plasma market. On the other hand the 42PC1D has a pixel format of 1024 x 768, which I call simply HD because it really does not have enough horizontal pixels to take a 720p HD signal with 16:9 aspect ratio. The 42PC1D will go for roughly US$2500.&Acirc;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dlmag.com/1643/lg-breaks-in-with-new-plasma-s.html"></a></p>
