<p><a href="http://youtu.be/9Pp7nDmb5K4">Good video</a>: "Sony has always brought you new experiences, and now you can enjoy the best of Sony in a smartphone."</p>
<p><em>Update 2013.03.11:</em> Perhaps not. Vlad Savov, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/11/4084004/sony-xperia-z-review">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Color accuracy and the automatic brightness adjustment are both well calibrated on the Z, however Sony&acirc;&euro;&trade;s latest flagship retains a weakness from its predecessors: poor viewing angles.</blockquote></p>
<p>One of the most important features of... actually the display <em>is</em> the smartphone. Without a perfect display there is nothing you can do to the rest of the smartphone to make it perfect. I cannot believe Sony blew the most simple thing when it comes to a smartphone display: viewing angles.</p>
