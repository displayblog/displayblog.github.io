  the best was this: MULTITOUCH Warcraft!!! Warcraft III was running on what looked
  like a 50\" plasma TV and the guys at PQ Labs (<a href=\"http://multi-touch-screen.net/\">http://multi-touch-screen.net</a>)
  were having a lot of fun so I had to record it. Take a look:\r\n\r\n<object width=\"480\"

<p>At Interactive Displays 2009, there were a lot of interesting things but the best was this: MULTITOUCH Warcraft!!! Warcraft III was running on what looked like a 50" plasma TV and the guys at PQ Labs (<a href="http://multi-touch-screen.net/">http://multi-touch-screen.net</a>) were having a lot of fun so I had to record it. Take a look:</p>
<p><object width="480" height="385" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/zwTfZ7B9N9M&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/zwTfZ7B9N9M&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object></p>
<p>Another video after the jump. <a id="more"></a><a id="more-5612"></a></p>
<p>Here's another with some quick multitouch action that the guys at PQ Labs put up on YouTube:</p>
<p><object width="480" height="385" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/Tmyadv4p6HI&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Tmyadv4p6HI&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object></p>
