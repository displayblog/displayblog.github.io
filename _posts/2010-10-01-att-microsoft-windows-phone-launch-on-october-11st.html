<blockquote><p>Microsoft will receive the marketing support of AT&T, which will be the initial exclusive U.S. carrier to sell the Windows Phone 7 smartphones. AT&T plans to sell the devices the week of Nov. 8. Initially, the carrier will offer three handsets&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;one each made by Samsung Electronics Co., LG Electronics Inc., and HTC Corp.&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;as it looks to diversify its portfolio of mobile devices beyond the iPhone.<br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>AT&T seems to be the exclusive carrier for Windows Phone. Maybe AT&T is losing Apple next year. <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/01/atandt-launching-windows-phone-7-handsets-on-november-8-unveiling/">Engadget</a></p>
