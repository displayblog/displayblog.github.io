<p><a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120327/flat-panel-tv-sales-flatten-in-u-s/">John Paczkowski, AllThingsD</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Market research firm IHS iSuppli said Tuesday that U.S.-bound shipments of flat-panel TVs will drop 5 percent in 2012, slipping to 37.1 million units from 39.1 million units in 2011. And that decline will likely continue for the next few years. By 2013, IHS figures shipments will drop to just below 35 million; by 2015, they&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll be hovering around 34.2 million.</blockquote></p>
<p>We all agree that no one knows one whit about what's going to happen this year, next year, or three years from now. Right? OK. Second, iSuppli isn't known to be accurate, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/02/24/isuppli-claim-chowder"><em>at all</em></a>. And Paczkowski titles the post as TV sales while iSuppli is guessing TV shipments. I would think by now everyone in the universe knew the difference between sales and shipments; I guess I was wrong. And finally, a TV is not a TV is not a TV. IHS iSuppli seems to think one shipment of a 55-inch TV is the same thing as a 32-inch TV. You and I well know it's not. So what does it really mean when IHS iSuppli says on a Tuesday that U.S. TV shipments will drop 5% in 2012 to 37.1 million units? Not a damn thing.</p>
