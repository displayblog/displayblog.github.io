<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/11/18/tpp_wikileaks_white_house_claims_to_support_cellphone_unlocking_but_treaty.html">Derek Khanna, Slate</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In particular, the legislation would ensure that jailbreaking&mdash;which is installing a different operating system, or altering the existing operating system, on your phone, tablet, or e-reader&mdash;would also be illegal without permission from the Librarian of Congress (making a permanent fix impossible,). What type of nation would arrest <a href="http://cir.ca/news/evasi0n-jailbreak-tool-proves-popular">23 million</a> people for installing a different operating system, or altering an existing one, on their own device?*</blockquote></p>
