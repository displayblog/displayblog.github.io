<p>BenQ's MP510 is a front projector that uses DLP technology. The MP510 is available in the South Korean market for 698,000 KRW or about US$750. The box itself is a glossy white and has a 160W lamp with a lifetime of 2000 hours (3000 hours if used in economic mode) with a brightness of 1500 lumens. Contrast ratio is a respectable 2000:1. Inputs include VGA, Component Video, S-Video and Composite Video.</p>

<p>With a "MSRP" of US$750, I would guess street prices will be around $650, which will make the MP510 quite a bargain. Of course, HD fans will need to pass since the 800 x 600 resolution will not be enough for HD content. However, for DVD, SD, and simple PC-based presentations, the resolution is capable. In terms presentations, the MP510 even has a presentation timer.</p>
