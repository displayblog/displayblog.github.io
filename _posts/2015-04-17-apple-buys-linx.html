<p><a href="http://www.wsj.com/article_email/apple-buys-israeli-camera-technology-company-linx-1429037790-lMyQjAxMTI1NjE4NDAxMjQzWj">Orr Hirschauge and Daisuke Wakabayashi, The Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>LinX develops and markets miniature cameras for tablets and smartphones. Using an array of sensors that capture multiple images at the same time and proprietary algorithms, LinX says its cameras can gauge depth and create three-dimensional image maps.</blockquote></p>
<p>High Dynamic Range or HDR as it is implemented in iPhones today takes advantage of one image sensor and rapidly capturing multiple photos with different settings. With LinX technology an HDR photo could be taken almost instantly. I don't know about creating 3D image maps, but it could come in handy if Apple  decides to jump into virtual reality.</p>
