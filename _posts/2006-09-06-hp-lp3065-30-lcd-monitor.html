<p>It's taken HP a while to offer its own 30" monster. The LP3065 30" LCD monitor touts the same 2560 x 1600 resolution as Dell's <a href="http://displayblog.wordpress.com/2006/05/08/dell-3007wfp-backlight-uniformity-problems/">3007WFP</a> and Apple's 30" Cinema HD. The LP3065 will have a 8ms response time, a significantly upgraded 92% NTSC color gamut compared to the other two, with an estimated price tag of around $1999 on November 1, 2006, when it ships. The LP3065 will sport an enhanced CCFL backlight that has better phosphors, commonly refered to as a Wide Color Gamut CCFL (WCG-CCFL).</p>

<p><em>Update 2006.09.08-23:36<br />
</em>The display features a contrast ratio of 1000:1, 178-degree viewing angles, a brightness of 300 cd/m2 and three dual-link DVI-D inputs. Brightness can be better since most large-sized LCD monitors sport around 400 cd/m2, but with the enormous amount of pixels getting in the way of the backlight, it is understandable that brightness is only an acceptable 300 nits. The most likely supplier of these beautiful panels would be LG.Philips LCD (LPL) as they are the key supplier to both Dell and Apple.</p>
<p><em>Update 2007.01.02</em><br />
ExtremeTech has completed a review of the LP3065. The LP3065 does not have an OSD and gives you just four buttons on the lower right: power, input, + and -. The + and - buttons are there to change the brightness settings only. All of the other settings such as color, contrast, gamma, etc. are done using the control panel that comes with your graphics card. The review states that the panel manufacturer is LG.Philips LCD (LPL). HP stated that the next-generation will incorporate video processing capabilities later in 2007. Gray-to-gray response times are 6ms while the rise/fall response time is 12ms. Compared to Dell's 3007WFP, the review noted better brightness, larger contrast ratio, and better uniformity. With color and contrast calibrated, ExtremeTech stated the result as "nothing short of spectacular". One thing that I did not know was the native support of 2560 x 1600 from games such as Guild Wars, Gothic 3 and Medieval 2!</p>
