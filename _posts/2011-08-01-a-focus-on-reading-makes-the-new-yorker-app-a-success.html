<p>Pamela Maffei McCarthy, Deputy Editor of The New Yorker, <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/01/business/media/new-yorker-on-ipad-shows-viewers-want-to-read.html">The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>That was really important to us: to create an app all about reading. There are some bells and whistles, but we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re very careful about that. We think about whether or not they add any value. And if they don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t, out the window they go.</blockquote></p>
<p>The New Yorker iPad app has been most successful for Cond&Atilde;&copy; Nast:</p>
<ul>
<li>iPad readers: 100,000</li>
<li>iPad app annual subscribers: 20,000</li>
<li>Print subscriber downloads: 75,000</li>
<li>Single issue purchasers: thousands per week</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>David Remnick, Editor of The New Yorker:</p>
<blockquote><p>What do people read The New Yorker for? To read.</blockquote></p>
<p>I'd like to see an iPad feature that turns the LCD into an E Ink, so I can really get some reading done.</p>
