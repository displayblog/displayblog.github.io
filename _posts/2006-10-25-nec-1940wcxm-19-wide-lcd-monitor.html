<p>NEC's 1940WCXM is a 19" wide LCD monitor with 1440 x 900 resolution, 700:1 contrast ratio and 300 cd/m2 of brightness. It has a VGA port and DVI inputs. The response time is a respectable 5ms. 1-watt integrated speakers come with the monitor. Nothing very interesting about this monitor, though the price is okay at $269.99. Dell's new 20" wide at just a few more dollars would be the better choice as it comes with 1680 x 1050 resolution. In my book, the more resolution you have, the better it is. Can we get a 19" wide with 1680 x 1050 resolution?
