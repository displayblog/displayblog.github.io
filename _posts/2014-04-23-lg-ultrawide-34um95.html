<p><a href="http://www.lg.com/uk/monitors/lg-34UM95">LG</a>: The LG UltraWide 34UM95. The high tech industry seems to love attaching the word &acirc;&euro;&tilde;ultra&acirc;&euro;&trade; in front of everything: Ultra HD, UltraWide, Ultrabook. (Don't forget <em>Ultraman</em>!) UltraWide is LG's marketing-speak for 21:9, which is the aspect ratio a lot of feature films use. Have you noticed black bars on the top and bottom when you watch movies on your 16:9 smartphone? That's because feature films are ultra wide.</p>
<p>A typical high end 16:9 monitor sports 2560x1440. Stretch it out to 21:9 and you get 3440x1440, and that's what the 34UM95 has. The 21:9 aspect ratio will undoubtedly be great for watching 21:9 feature films and games, but I think ultra wide monitors can be a great replacement for multiple monitor setups too. Instead of having three 1280x1024 monitors you can have almost the same display area with three 1146x1440 windows on the 34UM95. Or instead of having two 1600x1200 monitors you can have two 1720x1440 windows. Having a single large monitor also means no thick bezels in between monitors, less power cables, less DVI/VGA/HDMI cables, less visual clutter, and less power consumption.</p>
<p>Other specifications include a terrific viewing angle (178/178 left-right/up-down degrees) thanks to it being an IPS LCD, 8-bit pixels for 16 million colors, and the surface is treated with anti-glare and a 3H hard coating. The last bit of good is the color gamut of 99% of sRGB. sRGB is the color space most cameras use, what's generally used for printing, and most of what you see on the Internet. The 2009 17-inch MacBook Pro, which was touted as having 60% more color space than the previous generation, is what I'm using to type this post; it sports 72% NTSC or about 100% sRGB. Just because a display supports 100% Adobe RGB, a much larger color space, does not mean the graphics on the Internet, your smartphone, your point-and-shoot, your printouts at CostCo, Target or Walgreens will.</p>
<p>LG also claims the 34UM95 can display 1 billion colors. That's partially true. The sub-pixels are not 10 bit; they are 8 bit: 256 (2^8) levels of gray multiplied by itself three times for each of the three sub-pixels equals about 16 million colors. LG uses FRC or Frame Rate Control to dither the grays to make each sub-pixel act like it is 10 bit, for a grand total of over 1 billion levels of gray (2^10 is 1024 and then to get all the grayscale combinations: 1024x1024x1024). Add in a color filter on top of those gray levels and you get color.</p>
<p>The LG UltraWide 34UM95 is a fantastic monitor for watching feature films, gaming, and work, if you can afford it. The 34UM95 will be released on April 30, 2014 and can be pre-ordered on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IJUFGDE/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00IJUFGDE&linkCode=as2&tag=displ0f-20">Amazon for US$1484.65</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=displ0f-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00IJUFGDE" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.

<p>PS: This 34-inch display is marketed as a monitor, which sounds crazy to me because the largest display we have in our home is a 34-inch Sony XBR CRT TV. Yes, it is ancient technology and millions throughout the world are kicking their CRT TVs to the curb and replacing them with LCDs, but I must tell you: there is not much out there that can compete with the picture quality of a Sony XBR CRT TV. I digress. The reason why a 34-inch display can be marketed as a monitor is because our visual system looks for height to figure out if it is big or not. A 21:9 34-inch monitor doesn't look any bigger than a 27-inch 16:9 to us because both the 34-inch and 27-inch is about 13 inches tall. Big, but not really.</p>
