<p>Boy Genius Report (BGR) acquired some hot information regarding <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dell">Dell</a>'s roadmap for its Latitude line of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=notebook-pc">notebook PC</a>s. Around November of this year, Dell is planning to introduce a convertible <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=tablet-pc">tablet PC</a>, its XT2. And around the January 2009 timeframe Dell will be phasing out its current XT.</p>
<p>Most likely the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=12.1"">12.1"</a> LCD will sport a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led-backlight">LED backlight</a> and the XT2 is geared to earning Energy Star and EPEAT ratings. The chassis seems to be moving toward using magnesium alloy to make it tough and light. Finally, and I don't know why it took so long, the XT2 will probably have a backlit keyboard.</p>
