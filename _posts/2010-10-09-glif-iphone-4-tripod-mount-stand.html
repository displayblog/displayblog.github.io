<p>Glif is exactly what I'm looking for, and a lot more. Just two days ago I gave up using a Motorola RAZR, stopped by an Apple Store, and upgraded to an iPhone 4. After using the iPhone 4 for just a few days I believe it is good enough to replace your point-and-shoot digital camera. And the best thing about using the iPhone 4 as your camera is that you take it almost everywhere you go.</p>
<p>I originally got word about Glif <em>via</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/10/04/glif">Daring Fireball</a>. Here's what Glif is all about according to Dan Provost and Thomas Gerhardt on <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/danprovost/glif-iphone-4-tripod-mount-and-stand">Kickstarter</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The idea for the Glif was first formed when we realized the iPhone 4 is literally the best camera we've ever owned. With the addition of HD video recording and High Dynamic Range photography, it's clear Apple is positioning the iPhone as a very high quality portable camera. But because of its small form factor (and Apple's minimalist design approach) it will never contain a threaded nut for attaching a tripod - standard on almost all photo and video cameras. Solutions for mounting an iPhone to a tripod exist (DIY or otherwise) but they are typically bulky and cumbersome. Our goal was to create something small, simple, and elegant.</blockquote></p>
<p>Glif is very exciting to me. I'm looking forward to getting a 3D printed Glif a little after November 2nd, when the Kickstarter project funding ends.</p>
