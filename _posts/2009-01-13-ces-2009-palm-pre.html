<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=palm">Palm</a> unveiled its Palm Pre <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=smartphone">smartphone</a> at CES 2009. The external design of the Pre is quite simple and is elegant in its own slighty cute way with slightly more rounded edges compared to the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=iphone">iPhone</a>. What quickly differentiates the Pre from an iPhone is the existence of a QWERTY keyboard--a physical one that slides out, toward the bottom. That means you'll be typing with the physical keyboard in portrait mode only. A lot more information after the break.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-3855"></a></p>
<p>In terms of size, the Pre is a bit smaller than the iPhone when the QWERTY keyboard is hiding and slightly larger then the keyboard is extended. Similar to the iPhone there is just one physical button on the front face and is used to access the "cards". We'll come back to the card concept later. In addition to the physical button, right next to it (left and right) is a touch-enabled gesture area where soft <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led">LED</a>s glow in response to finger gestures.</p>
<p>As you can see from the picture above, the Pre is able to multi-task by having multiple windows that look like cards that float about. I believe you simply have to flick your finger toward the left or right to see the semi-hidden and fully-hidden cards.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=3.1"">3.1"</a> capacitive touch-enabled TFT LCD is flush with the face of the device, similar to the iPhone. That simply means that Palm has used either a glass or plastic cover over the LCD. The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=480-x-320">480 x 320</a> pixel format in landscape mode is identical to the iPhone's but with the smaller 3.1" (versus iPhone's <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=3.5"">3.5"</a>) the Pre has a higher pixel density.</p>
<p>Palm's Pre has a unique charging solution: Touchstone. Touchstone is an inductive charging system that charges the Pre without any cable connected to the smartphone. Just place the Pre on top of the Touchstone charger and... it starts charging. Very cool.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><img class="size-full wp-image-3857 aligncenter" title="palm_pre_back" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/palm_pre_back.jpg" alt="palm_pre_back" width="314" height="489" /></p></p>
<p>The 3MP webcam (versus the 2MP on the iPhone) has a LED flash (the iPhone doesn't) and can be continuously shot without saving. The battery is also removeable--a feature that is a must for power users. With the A-GPS chip onboard the Pre might have a dedicated GPS navigation software pre-installed, but that's just a guess. Two features that the Pre absolutely trump the iPhone on are the ability to connect as a 3G modem via Bluetooth and the ability to use it as a USB mass storage device.</p>
<p>The Pre will come in two versions: CDMA and GSM. CDMA versions will be available through Spring while the GSM version is yet undecided. Unfortunately the Sprint version will not be a global phone and will not have GSM access.</p>
