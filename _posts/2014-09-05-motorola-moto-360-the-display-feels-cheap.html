<p>David Pierce, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/5/6108947/moto-360-review">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The screen looks great at a glance, but not under close scrutiny: its 320 x 290 resolution is low enough that you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll see jagged edges on letters and can easily make out individual pixels, and the beveled edges of the Gorilla Glass give off a sort of shimmering moir&Atilde;&copy; pattern. The edges almost glitter, making everything harder to read and just a little bit dirty looking. (It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a fingerprint magnet, too, which doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t help.) It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the only thing about the 360 that looks or feels cheap.</blockquote></p>
<p>The display should be the most awesome thing on a display-centric device like a smartwatch.</p>
