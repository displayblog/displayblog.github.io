<p><a href="http://www.bang-olufsen.com/beovision-85-press">Bang & Olufsen</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Not only does the BeoVision 4-85 plasma panel qualify as &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Full HD&acirc;&euro;&trade;, which means razor sharp details, rich, lifelike colours and smooth movement of objects on the screen; it is also Bang & Olufsen&acirc;&euro;&trade;s first TV concept that includes 3D technology using active shutter glasses. In addition, with the help of Automatic Colour Management to counter the effects of age, it delivers exceptional picture quality, ensuring the same high level of performance year after year.</blockquote></p>
<p>Good design: check. 85 inches: check. Full HD: check. Plasma: okay. 3D: mmm. Active shutter glasses: Eh.</p>
