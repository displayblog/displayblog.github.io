<p>Chris Plante, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/22/6827863/apple-iphone-6-plus">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Instead, I did what a human does when they have a piece of technology to get rid of. I posted on Craigslist. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Person with iPhone 6 Plus looking to trade for iPhone 6 normal, plus a little cash.&acirc;&euro;¬ù I received a lot of responses, because I was one of the few people not asking for $1,500 or more.</p>
<p>At 2PM, I met a stranger at the AT&T on Broadway and we made the trade. He was thrilled. I was thrilled.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>That's when it hit me. I was miserable, too. I spent all this money on something that I thought would make me happy, and instead I felt like trash. I mindlessly pre-ordered the wrong phone from Apple, and my punishment was being treated like a desperate grunt with a loose wallet.</blockquote></p>
<p>A piece of technology will not make you happy. I will not lie to you, I am tempted to get an iPhone 6 Plus. But when I really think about the reason why (I can get rid of my iPhone, iPad, camera, and simplify my life) the humongous iPhone will not make me happy by simplifying my life. My life is not complicated because I have to haul around two additional gadgets, two more cables, and manage two more gadgets. My life is complicated because there are so many things my heart is running after, instead of just one.</p>
<p>Stop thinking a new piece of technology will make you happy; it will not. I am telling myself, more than anyone. Besides <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/09/13/tim-cook-making-a-better-phone-in-every-single-way/">the iPhone 6 Plus is ugly</a>.</p>
