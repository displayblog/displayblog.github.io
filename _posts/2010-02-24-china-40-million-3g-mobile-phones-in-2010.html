<p>Topology Research Institute, a Taiwan-based market research firm, expects 3G mobile phones to top 40 million units in China for 2010. China's 3G technology is called TD-SCDMA and the total number of 3G service subscribers will balloon to 71 million by the end of 2010. No doubt China will soon become the largest market for a lot of things including 3G mobile phones. Source: <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20100224PB203.html">DIGITIMES</a></p>
