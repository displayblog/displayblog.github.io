<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=fe-technologies">FE Technologies</a>, a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sony">Sony</a> spinoff, demonstrated its 19" <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=nano-spindt-fed">nano-Spindt FED</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=field-emission-display">Field Emission Display</a>) running Gran Turismo 5 on the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=playstation-3">PlayStation 3</a> at <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=240hz">240Hz</a>. The nano-Spindt screen has more than 10,000 electron sources that are called the nano-spindt emitter. That's 10,000 nano-Spindt emitters per pixel. To produce light a fluorescent substance is exposed to electrons. FED has a very wide viewing angle and has no motion blur challenges. Those features will challenge both LCD and plasma technologies. In addition, FED has really deep blacks.&Acirc;&nbsp;Behind the RGB sub-pixels are 10,000 nano-Spindt emitters. You can get a better idea by looking at the diagram below. The nano-Spindt emitter is the cone-shaped element (left) and there are 10,000 of them (middle) that make up the RGB-based pixel (right).</p>

<p>Unlike an LCD, there is no backlight structure since the nano-Spindt emitter generates light when electricity is run through. There is some space requirement for the vacuum portion but is overall much thinner than LCDs. You can see that the structure of the FED is extremely simple, although the fabrication of the nano-Spindt emitters will require extreme precision. Being thin and consuming lower power will prove to be very important features since now and in the future these will be differentiating features that get consumers' attention.</p>
