<p>The 23" LCD monitor sports an aspect ratio of 16:9 and features a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a> pixel format: good for watching HD. The only connection seems to be a DVI-I input; it would have been much better if there was an HDMI connection too since the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1080p">1080p</a>-capability looks to be limited to whatever you can feed it from the PC. Of course, you can opt to purchase a HDMI-to-DVI cable: usually they are too expensive but I've seen some good deals on eBay recently. Speaking of good deals, the P2370L looks to be a very good deal at just $399.</p>
