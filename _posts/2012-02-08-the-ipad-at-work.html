<blockquote><p>The thing I found the hardest to get used to on the iPad was the lack of windows. On the Mac, I think nothing of arranging a Web browser and a text editor, or two text-editor windows, side by side and then referring to one while typing in the other. On the iPad, that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s impossible, as I found on the morning of day three when I tried to start composing this story from my notes.</blockquote></p>
<p>This too was the biggest change I experienced when I experimented with an iPad as my only work computer. Unfortunately, I was not able to adapt; going from a 17-inch MacBook Pro with a 1920x1200 pixel format to an iPad demanded too much of a change in the way I work.</p>
