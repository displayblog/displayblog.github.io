<p>Do I think Steve Jobs would want to wear 3D glasses to watch 3D stuff on the iPad? I don't think so. What I do think is that CPT, Chunghwa Picture Tubes, wanted to showcase it's 9.7-inch 4:3 3D LCD at Display Taiwan 2011. And what better way to do that than to stick it inside the most popular tablet? CPT seems to have chosen passive 3D technology.</p>
