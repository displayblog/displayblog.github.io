<p><a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/aboutsamsung/news/newsIrRead.do?news_ctgry=irnewsrelease&amp;news_seq=9982">Samsung</a>: On July 24, 2008, Samsung introduced its innov8 mobile phone that incorporates a 8MP digital camera. The name is a clever play with the number '8' as it is pronounced 'innovate' and it so happens '8' is the number of megapixels for the camera. Although there are mobile phones with cameras that have even more pixels, in this case 8 would be more than enough for most. I just hope the quality is good enough so you can leave your digital camera at home. The camera might be good enough but with the small 2.8-inch TFT LCD, I wonder if you can experience all the goodness the camera captures...</p>
