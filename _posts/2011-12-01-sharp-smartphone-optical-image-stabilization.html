<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/12/1/2602518/sharp-develops-worlds-thinnest-smartphone-camera-throws-it-in-some">Jeff Blagdon, The Verge</a>:</p><br />
<blockquote>
<p>Over in Japan, Sharp has been hard at work developing the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s thinnest optically image-stabilized smartphone camera, the company announced today. The RJ63YC100 is a 12.1-Megapixel, 1/3.2-inch shooter measuring a meager 11.0 x 11.0 x 5.47 millimeters. The module is backlit, with both optical image stabilization and 1080p video capture.</p> </blockquote>
<p>The next batch of high-end smartphones will most likely sport optical image stabilization in their cameras. Imagine the already superb camera in the iPhone 4S additionally paired with optical image stabilization. I was then going to say, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;I think the days of point-and-shoot cameras are numbered.&acirc;&euro;¬ù But the problem with high-end smartphones are not their US$199 entry price. The big problem with them is the 24 monthly bills that can amount to some serious cash drainage. Not everyone can afford to or want to chain themselves to a two-year smartphone commitment. So this is what I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll say instead: The days of point-and-shoot cameras are over when the camera in the iPhone 4S plus optical image stabilization gets inside the iPod touch.</p></p>
