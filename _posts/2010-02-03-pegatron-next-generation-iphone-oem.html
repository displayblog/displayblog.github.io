<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20100203PD223.html">DigiTimes</a>: The current iPhone 3G and 3GS smartphones are manufactured by Foxconn Electronics. The next generation iPhone will be built by Pegatron Technology. A little history: On the first of January, 2008, Asustek Computer split into three separate companies with Pegatron Technology focusing on manufacturing PC-related devices such as motherboards and add-in cards for third-party customers. If this is true, Pegatron seems to be an interesting choice for Apple.</p>
