<p>Panasonic's PT-AE1000U is a LCD projector with a Full HD resolution of 1920 x 1080. The PT-AE1000U sports a 11,000:1 contrast ratio, has a brightness of 1,100 ANSI lumens, 14-bit color correction and costs $5,999. A bit on the pricey side, but if you want to see all two megapixels of HD content, this is an option.</p>

The box itself has a nice simple design with the lens located right in the middle. I hope the prices for 1080p projectors come down (a lot!) because this is the cheapest way to get a 100" screen on the wall. Just make sure all of the curtains are down and the lights are off and get a big tub of popcorn.</p>
