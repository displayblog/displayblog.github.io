<p>That's the model number of the 9.7-inch IPS LCD panel in iPad, meaning LG Display is the manufacturer. And without saying the 1024x768 pixel format-touting panel sports a LED backlight. I hope this is a signal that LG Display will be developing small IPS LCD panels for other applications such as notebooks. I'm especially looking for <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/02/07/2010-macbook-pro-ips-core-i7/">next-gen MacBook Pro notebooks to incorporate IPS LCDs</a>.
