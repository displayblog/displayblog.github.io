<p>As of September 17, 2014 (today) iOS 8 is available. A couple of caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>TOO BIG: The iOS 8 update might be too big if you are attempting to update over the air using a WiFi connection. The solution is to connect your iPod, iPhone, or iPad to your computer and update using iTunes.</li><br />
<br /></p>
<li>iCLOUD DRIVE: Do not upgrade to iCloud Drive during the setup process. At the moment iCloud Drive is not compatible with OS X 10.9 Mavericks, the latest operating system from Apple. Many apps will not work with iCloud Drive. Syncing with your Mac will not work, unless your Mac is updated to OS X 10.10 Yosemite, which will be released later this year (source: <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2014/09/17/developers-warn-ios-8-users-not-to-upgrade-to-icloud-drive-before-os-x-yosemite-release/">9to5 Mac</a>).</li><br />
</ul></p>
