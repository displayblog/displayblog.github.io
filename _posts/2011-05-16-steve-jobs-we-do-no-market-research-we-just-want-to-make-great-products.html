<p><a href="http://www.ifo-roadtrip.com/db/apple-retail-quotes/">Steve Jobs</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We do no market research. We don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t hire consultants. The only consultants I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve ever hired in my 10 years is one firm to analyze Gateway&acirc;&euro;&trade;s retail strategy so I would not make some of the same mistakes they made [when launching Apple's retail stores]. But we never hire consultants, per se. We just want to make great products.</blockquote></p>
<p>And to think that I'm surrounded by folks in market research at SID 2011.</p>
