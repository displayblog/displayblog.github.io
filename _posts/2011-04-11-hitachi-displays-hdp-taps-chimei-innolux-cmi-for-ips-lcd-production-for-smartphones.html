<p><a href="http://www.hitachi-displays.com/en/news/2143902_18571.html">Hitachi Displays</a> (HDP):</p>
<blockquote><p>HDP has requested to Taiwanese LCD manufacturer Chimei Innolux Corporation (hereafter referred to as CMI) for the contracted production of small-size IPS LCDs for use in smart phones and other applications. With this operation, HDP plans to cover the loss caused by operation stop as well as prepares in case of shortage of power supply in summer. Supply capability will be improved from August 2011 with CMI panels.</blockquote></p>
<p>HDP has restored full LCD manufacturing operations as of April 5 and CMI seems poised to become a solid supplier of small/medium IPS LCDs.</p>
