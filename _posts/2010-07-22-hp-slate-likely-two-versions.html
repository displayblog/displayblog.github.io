<p>Speaking at the Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference, Todd Bradley, HP Personal Systems Group VP shared that the company's Slate tablet will be "more customer-specific than broadly deployed." The Windows-based Slate will be "for the enterprise" launched in the fall.</p>
<p>My guess? Two Slates. One very capable with lots and lots of ports for the enterprise with possibly an additional ruggedized version competing against Panasonic in vertical markets. The other Slate would be consumer focused, very pretty, with less ports.</p>
<p>I would also like to see one customized for kids that have features from both enterprise and consumer version: rugged, very light, and light on the wallet. Source: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/07/22/hp-slate-no-longer-a-consumer-product-will-arrive-for-enterpris/">Engadget</a></p>
