<blockquote>
<p>The launch of ultrabooks and Microsoft's Windows 8 OS will serve as growth drivers for the notebook industry in 2012, according to Simon Lin, chairman of Taiwan-based notebook ODM Wistron.</p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>This sounds similar to pior lofty expectations by tablet integrators. The ultrabook category leader is the Apple MacBook Air. By the time other ultrabooks hit the market in 2012, Apple will be in its third generation. <em>That</em> sounds similar too.</p></p>
