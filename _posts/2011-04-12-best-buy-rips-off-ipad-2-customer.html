<p>A pissed off Best Buy customer <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2011/04/11/best-buy-forces-customer-to-buy-service-plan-to-get-an-ipad-2-out-of-storage/">CrunchGear</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was at Best But yesterday while my girlfriend was buying a new pc and asked if they had any iPad 2 in stock and I was told no. As I strolled around I looked up and noticed at least 40 in an overhead lock up area so I inquired about them. I was told by an associate that they were all sold. Two minutes later a manager walks over and says the only way I could have one is if I puchased a 109 dollar Best Buy protection plan.</p>
<p>I said that doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t seem right. He then told to try and find one somewhere else they can do what they want. To make a long story short I purchased it just to find out if that was policy. I just went to another store spoke to a manager and was told that is not policy and should have not be forced to but the coverage just to purchase an iPad. After reading the story on CNN I just wanted to follow up with you guys. After my experience I think you were correct about they way they are distributing iPads. Thanks for the time. If you need anything else just let me know.</blockquote></p>
<p>The associate lied and the manager ripped him off. It's been years since I've set foot in a Best Buy store. The only brick-and-mortar store I go to for my Apple gear is an Apple Store. The second best option is Apple.com.</p>
