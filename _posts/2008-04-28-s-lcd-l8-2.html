<p>Samsung and Sony announced on April 25, 2008 that they will establish a second G8 TFT LCD manufacturing line, 8-2, for its S-LCD joint venture.</p>
<ul>
<li>Startup Date, Glass Input Capacity, Motherglass Dimension<br />
</li>
<li>G7 Line: April 2005, 100K/mo, 1870 x 2200mm<br />
</li>
<li>8-1: August 2007, 50K/mo, 2200 x 2500mm<br />
</li>
<li>8-2: Q2'09, 60K/mo, 2200 x 2500mm<br />
</li></ul><br />
Total investment for 8-2 will be around KRW1.8 trillion (about US$1.9 billion) and will be located in the Tangjeong Complex. Initial glass substrate input capacity will be at 60K/mo. Both G8 fabs will most likely increase to 90K/mo or more in the future to meet growing demand for large LCD TVs.</p>
<p>S-LCD's 8-1 fab is optimized to manufacture 46" and 52" LCD TV panels. The G8 glass substrate is large enough to cut eight 46" or six 52" panels. Usually, optimization occurs at around six to eight cuts per motherglass.</p>
<p>I might sound like a broken record, but the push toward larger more expensive LCD TVs might backfire. Consumers in the US simply do not have the disposable incomes that they used to prior to the housing market crash. If premium LCD TVs are your thing it would do good to focus on the rich and famous that don't seem to be impacted by general economic woes (just personal ones).</p>
