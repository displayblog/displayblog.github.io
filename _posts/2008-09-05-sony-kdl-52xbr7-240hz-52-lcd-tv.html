  just posted up a review of Sony's KDL-52XBR7</a>, which is the first LCD TV
  with 240Hz stating that it \"scored higher on motion resolution test patterns\"
  and gave it a 4 out of 5 stars \"Excellent\" rating. The price will be daunting
  for some as the MSRP is US$4100. The lesser sibling, the KDL-52XBR6 with 120Hz is
  about $1000 less. Black levels were very deep for a non-LED backlit LCD TV with
  accurate colors.\r\n\r\n<strong>Original Post</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sony\">Sony</a>
  introduced a <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=240hz\">240Hz</a>
  <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv\">LCD TV</a> to
  the world during <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=cedia\">CEDIA</a>
  2008 that was held this week in Colorado. The KDL-52XBR7 is the world's first and
  the only 240Hz LCD TV. Other features include a pixel format of <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080\">1920
  x 1080</a> that can accept 1080p video without scaling. If the video is less
  than <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1080p\">1080p</a>
  the <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=bravia-engine-2\">BRAVIA
  Engine 2</a> will take care of that and make sure it perfectly fits the 1920
  x 1080 pixel format of the KDL-52XBR7. "

<p>240Hz. Wow. That's 2x faster than 120Hz. 4x faster than 60Hz. What does the KDL-52XBR7 do with all of that speed? In a 120Hz LCD TV motion interpolation is used to insert a newly created frame in between two frames. With 240Hz you get three new frames. And that means that you get "exceptional motion detail in movies, sports, and video games." I can believe that. Maybe semiconductor technology can improve much like CPUs and we can expect a 360Hz or 480Hz frequency LCD TV in the future?</p>
