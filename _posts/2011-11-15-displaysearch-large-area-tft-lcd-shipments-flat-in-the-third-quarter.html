<p><a href="http://www.displaysearch.com/cps/rde/xchg/displaysearch/hs.xsl/111115_large_area_tft_lcd_shipments_flat_in_the_third_quarter.asp">DisplaySearch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Shipments of large-area TFT LCD panels were 185.5 million in Q3&acirc;&euro;&trade;11, unchanged from Q2&acirc;&euro;&trade;11, but up 12% Y/Y. Revenues reached $19.2 billion, down 2% Q/Q and 11% Y/Y. According to the DisplaySearch Quarterly Large-Area TFT LCD Shipment Report, panel makers are targeting a very modest 2% growth in shipments for Q4&acirc;&euro;&trade;11, as downstream manufacturers and brands are expected to prepare for the holiday season. Revenues are not expected to grow, however, because panel prices are still not showing signs of a rebound.</blockquote></p>
<p>LCD panel shipments in terms of units don't say much at all. For example there could be 50 million 10-inch tablet LCD panel shipments in Q3'11 and 50 million 55-inch LCD TV panel shipments. Add them up and you get 100 million large-area TFT LCD panels shipped. To count the tablet LCD panels as equal to LCD TV panels is obviously wrong: in terms of diagonal size the LCD TV panel is 5.5 times larger.</p>
<p>The resulting total unit shipments have little meaning. Q3'11 large-area TFT LCD shipments were 185.5 million units. What does that mean? Not much, precisely because the sizes differ so greatly.</p>
<p>Area shipments as in square meters or square feet is a better more accurate metric, which is used by LG Display and Corning.</p>
