<p>On September 5, 2006, Flextronics and International DisplayWorks (IDW) entered into an agreement whereby Flextronics would acquire via a stock-for-stock merger valued at around US$300 million. IDW is a LCD manufacturer that focuses on small-sized LCD module assembly. The acquisition of IDW will help Flextronics become more vertically integrated to offer LCD design and manufacturing capability. Flextronics will combine IDW's LCD operations with its Camera Module Group, TV tuner, Wifi, and TFT module assembly operations to create a new business unit under Flextronic's Components Division. IDW will receive the bulk of LCD sourcing duties.</p>
