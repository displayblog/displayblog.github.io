<p><a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2009/12/24/apple-purchased-islate-com-in-2007-apples-new-tablet-called-islate/">MacRumors</a>: Apple has owned the iSlate.com domain since 2007 according to MacRumors. Here's Bill Keller, executive editor at the New York Times who mentioning the all important product at a presentation to the company's digital staff:</p>
<blockquote><p>We need to figure out the right journalistic product to deliver to mobile platforms and devices. I'm hoping we can get the newsroom more actively involved in the challenge of delivering our best journalism in the form of Times Reader, iPhone apps, WAP, or the impending Apple slate, or whatever comes after that.</blockquote></p>
<p>Three critical words: "impending Apple slate". Combine this with Apple's ownership of iSlate.com and the result is a rumor that Apple will call its tablet iSlate.</p>
