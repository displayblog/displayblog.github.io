<p>That's the question I would like to pose to you. I just finished reading <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/29/htc-evo-4g/">TechCrunch's review</a> of the HTC EVO 4G linked via John Gruber's <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/05/29/mg-evo">Daring Fireball</a>. The HTC EVO 4G's hardware specifications make me drool, especially the massive 4.3-inch LCD with a 800x480 pixel format. But there is a really big problem. TechCrunch's MG Siegler:</p>
<blockquote><p>Good luck getting more than 4 hours of moderate usage out of this bad boy.</blockquote><br />
I can have the most brilliant piece of technology in my hands but if it lasts just four hours when I need it to last the entire day and sometimes into the night, it really is nothing but rubbish, high-tech rubbish.</p>
