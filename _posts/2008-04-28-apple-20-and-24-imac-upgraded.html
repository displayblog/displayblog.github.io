<p>20" 2.4GHz iMac<br />
RAM: 1GB DDR2<br />
HDD: 250GB 7200RPM SATA<br />
Optical: Slot-load 8x SuperDrive<br />
GPU: ATI Radeon HD 2400 XT 128MB GDDR3<br />
Price: $1200</p>
<p>Options for 20" 2.4GHz:<br />
RAM: 4GB DDR2<br />
HDD: 500GB SATA</p>
<p>20" 2.66GHz iMac<br />
RAM: 2GB DDR2<br />
HDD: 320GB 7200RPM SATA<br />
Optical: Slot-load 8x SuperDrive<br />
GPU: ATI Radeon HD 2600 PRO 256MB GDDR3<br />
Price: $1500</p>
<p>Options for 20" 2.66GHz:<br />
RAM: 4GB DDR2<br />
HDD: 750GB SATA</p>
<p>24" 2.8GHz iMac<br />
RAM: 2GB DDR2<br />
HDD: 320GB 7200RPM SATA<br />
Optical: Slot-load 8x SuperDrive<br />
GPU: ATI Radeon HD 2600 PRO 256BM GDDR3</p>
<p>Options for 24":<br />
CPU: 3.06GHz Intel Core 2 Duo<br />
RAM: 4GB DDR2<br />
HDD: 1TB SATA<br />
GPU: NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GS 512MB</p>
<p>All of these units incorporate new Intel Core 2 Duo CPUs that have a L2 cache of 6MB and a faster 1066MHz FSB. The CPUs are manufactured with state-of-the-art 45-nm process technology that should yield smaller footprints and faster processing. Based on testing conducted by Apple using the 24" 2.8GHz with 2GB RAM, HDV rendering and encoding in Final Cut Pro should run 28% faster and Photoshop ran 22% faster in a 45-filter function test compared to a previous-generation 2.4GHz iMac.</p>
<ul>
<li>Final Cut Pro. HDV render and encode: 28% faster<br />
</li>
<li>iPhoto. Common application tasks: 27% faster<br />
</li>
<li>Adobe Photoshop. 45-filter function test: 22% faster<br />
</li>
<li>iMovie. Common application tasks: 21% faster<br />
</li>
<li>iTunes. Convert for iPhone: 21% faster<br />
</li>
<li>Safari. HTML, JavaScript, Java VM: 17% faster<br />
</li></ul><br />
The NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GS 512MB option improves graphics performance as well. Apple shows a 2.2x improvement in Quake 4 at 1920 x 1200 High Quality settings for the 2.8Ghz 24" iMac with the NVIDIA option compared to a standard 2.8GHz iMac using ATI's Radeon HD 2600 PRO 256MB.</p>
<p>I consider Apple's iMac one of the best desktop computers around for those that focus on getting things done (and with style) with the computer. Because of the rather enclosed design, the iMacs are not for those who like to tinker with the insides. The 24" iMac with a pixel format of 1920 x 1200 is a beautiful sight.</p>
<p>Personally, I would like to see easy upgradeability married with great design. With this combination, I think there would be less material impact on the environment. Imagine an iMac where you can easily replace the CPU, GPU, LCD, entire motherboard, RAM, HDD, optical drive, etc. Instead of an entire computer being retired, it could just be a small SDRAM module or a HDD.</p>
<p>The iMacs are generally earth-friendly as they use a healthy dose of recyclable glass and aluminum and are rated EPEAT Silver and Energy Star 4.0. It seems Apple colored the backside of the iMac black.</p>
