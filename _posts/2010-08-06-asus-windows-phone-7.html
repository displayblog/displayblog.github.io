<p>Is this a real Windows Phone 7 from ASUS? <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/08/06/asus-windows-phone-7-debuts-in-the-wild/">Engadget</a>'s Vlad Savov seems to think the display tech is OLED. My question is: where is ASUS getting these OLED panels from since there is a major shortage thanks to Samsung Mobile Display hogging all of them for its own Samsung-branded smartphones? Pantech is moving from OLED to LCD due to the shortage (source: <a href="http://nexus404.com/Blog/2010/08/04/pantech-suspends-use-of-amoled-due-to-shortage-the-amoled-shortage-hits-pantechs-cell-phone-line/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+ThoughtsFromTheSidelines+(TFTS)">TFTS</a>). HTC is doing the same for Desire and Nexus One (source: <a href="http://techblips.dailyradar.com/story/htc-makes-super-lcd-screens-for-desire-and-nexus-one/">TechRadar</a>).</p>
