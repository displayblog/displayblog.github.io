<p>Casey Johnston, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/01/heres-what-you-will-look-like-while-using-smart-glasses/">Ars Technica</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The potential uses of a pair of smart glasses are easy to fixate on: simply glance to one side at the tiny screen and check your e-mail, make sure you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re walking in the right direction according to your maps app, see what the weather will be like later in the afternoon. But some realities about the glasses have yet to be addressed&mdash;for one, what we all might look like using these things.</blockquote></p>
<p>There are still significant technical hurdles, such as miniaturization, for smart glasses such as Google Glasses to become a reality, but the biggest hurdle has nothing to do with technology.</p>
