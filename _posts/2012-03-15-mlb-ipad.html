<p>Cincinnati Reds, manager of video scouting, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/story/2012-03-13/MLB-ipad/53533498/1">Rob Coughlin</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Look around the clubhouse. Just about every single (player) has an iPad they can use to prepare for a game.</blockquote></p>
<p>Regarding the new iPad:</p>
<blockquote><p>With the '3,' now you're going to be able to see the grip on the baseball, perhaps even the rotation of the baseball and be able to (better) break down mechanics. A decade ago (the latest) was VHS tapes, then the quality of video improved when everything went digital. Now, the next step is getting everything in high definition. The clearer the picture, the clearer you can see what the pitcher is trying to do.</blockquote></p>
