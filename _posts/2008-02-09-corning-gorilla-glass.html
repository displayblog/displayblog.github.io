<p><a href="http://www.corning.com/news_center/news_releases/2008/2008020803.aspx">Corning</a>On February 8, 2008, during its annual investor meeting in New York, Corning introduced a new type of glass geared for touch display applications. The new type of glass is called Gorilla and can withstand daily use and abuse without being scratched. The glass is fusion-formed and does not require any polishing. The Gorilla glass is now commercially available and is being supplied to mobile device manufacturers. I hope most glass used in mobile devices as well as notebook PCs, LCD monitors and LCD TVs can have scratch-resistance built-in.</p>
