<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/01/samsung-galaxy-tab-review/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Tab doesn't have a Super AMOLED screen like its Galaxy S smartphone brothers, but the 1024 x 600-resolution LCD is still stunning. It's notably better than most other tablet screens we've seen of late, which, of course, means that the first thing we noticed was its stellar viewing angles. (You know us and our hang-up with viewing angles.) Tilting the screen off-axis doesn't cause color distortion and sharing it with a friend didn't require us to make any adjustments.</blockquote></p>
<p>In terms of displays, Samsung seems to be putting some good ones into their high-end gadgets. The Galaxy Tab included.</p>
