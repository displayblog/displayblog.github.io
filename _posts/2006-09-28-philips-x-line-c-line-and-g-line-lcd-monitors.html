<p>C-line is the entry-level boring line. G-line is the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;multitainment&acirc;&euro; monitor line and the X-line is the performance line. So don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t waste your time with the C-line unless you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re really strapped for cash. You have to give it to Philips to come out with another bastardized word like &acirc;&euro;&oelig;multitainment&acirc;&euro;. Can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t they have simply stuck with entertainment? Anyway&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; on to the monitors. The X-line comes in 17&acirc;&euro;&sup3;, 19&acirc;&euro;&sup3;, 19&acirc;&euro;&sup3; wide, 20&acirc;&euro;&sup3;, and 20&acirc;&euro;&sup3; wide sizes with Philips&acirc;&euro;&trade; SmartImage Lite, an image enhancement technology with presets for video playback, web browsing, etc. and the monitor adjusts brightness, contrast and sharpness to make the picture look the best. Personally, I like to control these settings. These X-line monitors also come with Philips&acirc;&euro;&trade; Perfect Panel warranty that guarantees a defect-free display.</p>
<p>The 20&acirc;&euro;&sup3; model, the 200XW7, has a resolution of 1680 x 1050 (although Philips puts that at WSXGA, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s actually a WSXGA+ panel). The 200XW7 features the Super Ergo Base that allows it to tilt, rotate and swivel up to 90 degrees.</p>
<p>Both X and C models provide less than 5ms response times (on-off). Not the fastest, but certainly fast enough for most applications including some 3D gaming. The X and C lines have both VGA and DVI inputs and the X-line comes with USB connections.</p>
<p>IMO&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; Too many names and too many lines. Just come out with one set of great monitors that can do everything. There isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t much room for three lines in this razor-thin-margin market. Check out what Apple is doing: make the design great, procure great LCD panels, and sell it simply: they just have a total of three models! Of course, lower prices than Apple would be better.</p>
