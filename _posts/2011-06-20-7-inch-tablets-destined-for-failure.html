<p><a href="http://allthingsd.com/20110620/consumers-dont-want-tablets-they-want-ipads/">Berstein Research</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We find that consumers are not interested in form factors that deviate from the benchmark set by Apple. Few consumers, less than 15 percent prefer the 7&acirc;&euro;&sup3; screen size versus the 10&acirc;&euro;&sup3; screen of the iPad. Over 50 percent of respondents are firmly in favor of the 10&acirc;&euro;&sup3; screen, which leads us to conclude that the 7&acirc;&euro;&sup3; tablet models recently launched, like the BlackBerry PlayBook, are destined for failure. Consumer&acirc;&euro;&trade;s preference for the 10&acirc;&euro;&sup3; form factor explains the lukewarm response to Samsung&acirc;&euro;&trade;s 7&acirc;&euro;&sup3; Galaxy tablet and the rapid introduction of larger screen models in that series.</blockquote></p>
<p>Build 9.7-inch 1024x768 tablets. That way it will be easier for developers to build apps for other platforms.</p>
