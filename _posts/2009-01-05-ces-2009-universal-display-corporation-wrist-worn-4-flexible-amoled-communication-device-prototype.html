<p>On January 5, 2009, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=universal-display-corporation">Universal Display Corporation</a> (UDC) announced that it will exhibit a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=4"">4"</a> wrist-worn flexible <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=amoled">AMOLED</a> communication device prototype at CES. The AMOLED is fabricated on metal foil, is portable, rugged and comformable. The prototype communication device is the result of marrying UDC's phospherescent OLED (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=pholed">PHOLED</a>) technology with the benefits of a flexible <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=oled">OLED</a>. UDC has been working with the US Department of Defense through a program sponsored by the US Army Communication Electronics Research and Development Engineering Center (CERDEC) to make this future technology a reality today. What this all means is that our tax dollars are hard at working in bringing ultra-cool display technology that was developed for the Department of Defense, to you.</p>
