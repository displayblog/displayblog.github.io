<blockquote><p>[...] while the 40WL753 is capable of producing occasionally spectacular pictures, they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re ultimately defined - for us movie and console game lovers, at least - by that dreaded backlight inconsistency. So much so that we actually felt tense while watching films as we found ourselves waiting for the backlight flaws to suddenly pop up.</blockquote></p>
<p>The 40WL753 is Toshiba's flagship 40-inch LCD TV and priced at just &Acirc;&pound;700, but fails to impress due to backlight inconsistency.</p>
