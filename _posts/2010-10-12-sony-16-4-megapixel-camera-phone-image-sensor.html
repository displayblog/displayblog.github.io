<p><a href="http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/201010/10-137E/index.html">Sony</a> developed a 16.41 megapixel Exmor R back-illuminated CMOS 1/2.8 image sensor for camera phones; model name is IMX081PQ. There is an even smaller 1/3.2 8.13 megapixel IMX105PQ. The 16.41 megapixel image sensor will be available in January 2011 and the smaller one in April. I can't but wonder how much <em>more</em> everything could have been if there were less megapixels.</p>
