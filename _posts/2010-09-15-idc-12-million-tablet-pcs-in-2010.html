<p><a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1732170/forecast-predicts-million-ipad-sales-2011">The Inquirer</a>: IDC expects 12 million tablet PCs to ship in 2010. Next year? The market research firm is forecasting 18 million. </p>
<p>Bear in mind that UBS Investment Research's Maynard Um pegged the number of Apple's iPad shipments to hit 28 million in 2011. Maybe IDC isn't including the iPad under tablet PC. My personal guess is that there's going to be a much-improved iPad that'll be announced in January (read <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/09/08/2011-ipad/">2011 iPad</a>) and shipments will hit closer to 40 million.</p>
