<p><a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/12/02/iphone-sales-in-china-disappointing/">Fortune</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Chinese consumers bought 8-10 million smartphones last quarter, up from 2-3 million in the same period last year.</blockquote></p>
<p>Massive growth.</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple and RIM sold fewer than 500,000 last quarter [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>That's just 5%. I used 500,000 iPhones and 10 million overall smartphone sales in the third quarter for the sake of simple math. iPhone's third quarter shipment share goes up to 6.25% if 8 million is used.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Android smartphones made up 50% of third quarter smartphone sales in China. 50%!</p>
