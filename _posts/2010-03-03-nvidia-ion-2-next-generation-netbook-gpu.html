<p>NVIDIA claims 10 times the graphics performance of run-of-the-mill netbooks and up to 10 hours of battery life. Unofficially known as Ion 2, the new GPU that works with Intel's Atom Pine Trail CPUs in concert with the company's Optimus technology improves performance as well as battery power.</p>
<p>You can now expect smooth HD video playback and the ability to play some high-power games, for a long long time: Optimus automatically switches between the Ion 2 and integrated GPUs.&Acirc;&nbsp;Acer's Aspire One 532G (10-inch) and Asustek's 1201PN (12-inch) will be the first to feature NVIDIA's Ion 2. Apple should take careful note of the automatic GPU switching feature. Source: <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20100303PR205.html">DIGITIMES</a></p>
