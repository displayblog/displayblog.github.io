<p>On April 13, Toshiba Corp. announced plans for a 30"-class OLED TV to be launched in 2009. That's just just a little over 1 1/2 years away. Toshiba is considering a 30"-class OLED TV and the company's President and CEO, Asutoshi Nishida announced that Toshiba is certain that an OLED TV can be launched in 2009. Prior to this announcement, Toshiba looked further down the road around 2015 to 2016 for the commercialization of an OLED TV. Nishida stated that Toshiba's OLED TV would be bigger than what Toshiba Matsushita Display Technology Co., Ltd. (TMD) have developed. TMD created a 21" prototype OLED siplay that was announced just four days earlier. Toshiba's OLED display will be made out of polymer organic EL materials for the high-end and low molecular weight materials for commodity models. Sony just showcased a 27" OLED TV. TMD will be the OLED panel supplier to Toshiba. Nishida is convinced that OLED technology is superior to LCD and also that consumers will be too once they are exposed.<br />

Promises regarding OLED-based devices such as mobile phones, notebook PCs, monitors and even TVs have been made, many many times. Toshiba made promises about SED, the technology jointly developed with Canon that Toshiba had to pull out of due to legal issues. As far as I know, there is great difficulty in mass manufacturing OLED displays beyond a couple of inches. I am not sure Toshiba will be able to volume manufacture 30"-class OLED TVs by 2009. If the company is successful, and I hope it is, 2009 will be a very interesting year.</p>
