<p><a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/news/telecom/Soon-mobile-phones-in-India-will-carry-radiation-tags/articleshow/11214178.cms">Shalini Singh, The Times of India</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>India has so far been following a SAR limit of 2 watts/kg in accordance with ICNIRP (International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection Association) norms. An inter-ministerial committee has now curtailed the SAR level for mobile handsets further to 1.6 watts/kg average over a six minute period and taken over a volume containing a mass of 1 gram of human tissue. The SAR level shall now be displayed on handsets. </blockquote></p>
<p>Five safety precautions:</p>
<blockquote><p>Use a wireless, hands-free system with a low power Bluetooth emitter; ensure that cellphone has a low SAR; keep voice calls short or send text messages instead - an advice that applies especially to children, adolescents and pregnant women; use cellphone when signal quality is good; and finally people with active medical implants should preferably keep mobile handsets at least 15cms away from the implant.</blockquote></p>
<p>A healthier option than even a Bluetooth headset is the built-in speakerphone, which is what I use whenever possible. And children love to play with smartphones like the iPhone, my kids included. When I let them play with an iPhone I make sure it is in airplane mode and teach them why.</p>
