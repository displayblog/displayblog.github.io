<p>Young Optics Incorporated (YOI) announced shipment of its pico projector by Q2'08 - Q3'08. YOI's pico projector TI's DLP chip and RGB LED as the light source. The pico projector is rated to consume less than 1 watt with a brightness of 7 lumens, according to the company. YOI expects the pico projector to comprise 3% of the company's revenues for 2008. On the other hand, YOI is decreasing its emphasis on RPTV optical modules and instead focus on high-end optical engines for video walls.</p>

Pico projectors solve the problem of small screens that are attached to mobile phones. But, and this is a big but, pico projectors require some sort of surface for the projected image. For instance, if you are on a subway and want to view your YouTube video via the pico projector that is built-in, how would you go about setting it up? Or, if you're in a business meeting and want to share your presentation that you smartly stored on your mobile phone, would you force three or more corporate officers to crowd around a tiny screen?<br />

Maybe there are other, more useful, purposes for the pico projector, but I am having a difficult time figuring out what that could be.<br />
