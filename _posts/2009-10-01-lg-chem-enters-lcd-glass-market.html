<p><strong>No Worries</strong> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=corning&amp;sa=Search">Corning</a>'s CEO and chairman Wendell Weeks commented that LG Chem's entrance into the LCD glass market may not pose a major threat. Here are the three main barriers to entry that Weeks shared:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Obtain know-how on basic LCD glass manufacturing.</li>
<li><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Develop product that meets the industry's stringent technical requirements.</li>
<li><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Volume product to meet customer demand.</li>
<li><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Be cost competitive with an industry that has been reducing costs for the past 20 years.</li><br />
</ol><br />
<strong>Point 1</strong> LG Chem has an agreement to use Schott's glass making technology. A couple of years ago, Schott attempted to enter the LCD glass market but did not gain much market share. For about two to three quarters Schott struggled to gain any major customers and eventually exited the market. Knowledge transfer is not easy but will not be an insurmountable barrier to entry.</p>
<p><strong>Point 2</strong> I'm not sure if LG Chem will need to meet the industry's stringent technical requirements as long as it meets LG Display's requirements. My guess is that both LG Chem and LG Display will work closely together to make sure the glass substrates work with the LCD equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Point 3</strong> Yes, it does take time to ramp up but I'm sure both LG Chem and LG Display know that and will plan accordingly. In the mean time SCP can continue supplying LG Display some glass.</p>
<p><strong>Point 4</strong> The US car industry has been manufacturing cars longer than any other. The long history certainly has not protected the US car industry from being overtaken by newcomers. The last point does not make any sense at all. LG Chem can integrate the best-of-class in terms of equipment and technology to streamline manufacturing costs and be competitive with Corning or any other company who has been manufacturing LCD glass substrates for 20 years.</p>
<p><strong>Not Major</strong> I believe Weeks is telling the truth when he states that LG Chem's entrance into the LCD glass substrate industry does not pose a major threat. It won't. For now. The reason being that LG Chem will be solely supplying LG Display for the time being. SCP has been supplying some LCD glass substrates to LG Display but eventually will lose out to LG Chem at both locations in Paju and Gumi. Not a major threat but I'm sure it's not pleasant for Corning.</p>
