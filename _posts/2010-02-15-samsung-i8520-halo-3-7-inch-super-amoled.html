<p><a href="http://www.samsungmwc2010.com/pressrelease_ProductSpecs_02.html">Samsung</a> <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/02/14/samsung-i8520-halo-with-3-7-inch-super-amoled/">Engadget</a>: The Halo (i8520) from Samsung is the first Android (2.1 to be exact) smartphone sporting the company's Super AMOLED display. What's so super? The 3.7-inch Active Matrix OLED (AMOLED) display most likely manufactured by Samsung Mobile Display (SMD) features touch sensors that are embedded into the structure of the OLED. The Super AMOLED will be thinner and have more optical clarity. The pixel structure is probably the 2x2 sub-pixel PenTile Matrix that allows for a visual resolution equivalent to that of a 800x480 RGB stripe sub-pixel structured LCD.</p>
<p>Other specs include: 8MP autofocus camera with flash, 640x480 front-facing camera, video capture at 720/30p, DivX &amp; Xvid playback, Bluetooth 2.1, 3.5-mm headphone connection, WiFi BGN, A-GPS, 16GB internal storage, microSD, stereo speakers, DLNA, quad-band GSM/EDGE, tri-band UMTS 900/1900/2100, and &Acirc;&nbsp;an integrated Digital Light Processing (DLP) pico-projector. Because of the integrated pico-projector, the depth of the Halo is a thick 14.9 mm. Availability is slated for Q3'10.</p>
