<p>The folks over at iFixit bought a brand new DSi as soon as it went on sale and immediately took it apart. Here are some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Matte Black Skin Rougher</strong> than the DS Lite but easier to grip. Might be more scratch resistant.</li>
<li><strong>Less Battery Capacity</strong> DSi uses 840mAh compared to the Lite's 1000mAh.</li>
<li><strong>No More Game Boy Advance Port</strong> Instead you get a new SD slot.</li>
<li><strong>WiFi</strong> You can download DSiWare through Nintendo's online download library.</li>
<li><strong>Two Integrated Cameras</strong> VGA (640 x 480, 0.3MP) for pictures and video.</li>
<li><strong>Disassemble in 10 Minutes</strong> Experienced folks can disassemble the DSi in about 10 minutes. And you don't need a tri-wing screwdriver. Should make tinkering with the DSi quite fun. And easy.</li>
<li><strong>Samsung Is In</strong> Nintendo tapped Samsung for the flash memory and MMC controller: MoviNAND 256MB.</li>
<li><strong>September 2008</strong> That's around when it was manufactured. Nintendo wanted to make sure everyone who wants a DSi could get it before releasing it six months later.</li><br />
</ul><br />
Hop on over to iFixit for the complete teardown.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2009.04.07 5:42PM PDT</strong>: I just received some additional information about the LCD displays from iFixit and it seems they are tagged with these numbers:</p>
<p>Display #1:<br />
TX08D37VCA3<br />
N007S8992709</p>
<p>Display #2:<br />
TX08D36VCA2<br />
N071S88S0711</p>
<p>Anyone know what these part numbers might be referring to?</p>
