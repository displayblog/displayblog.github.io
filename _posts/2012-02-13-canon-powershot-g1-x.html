<blockquote><p>Our affection has everything to do with the large sensor, fast lens and the overall physicality of the camera -- its design, feel, and the accessibility of its controls. If you want a tool for capturing high-impact images, and not necessarily for adding impact to your images, then the G1 X ought to suit you fine.</blockquote></p>
<p>US$800. And it's a bit big to put in your pocket. I know you can't cheat physics when it comes to light: With everything else the same, a bigger faster lens and bigger pixels on the image sensor means better photos. But big also means less convenient. Big means tired-out shoulders, arms, and hands. Big means you might not ever have the option to take that photo because you left it at home.</p>
<p>I was at my buddy SooSang's house the other day and witnessed something I thought I wouldn't witness. He wanted to take a photo of our kids around the dinner table, and he goes and gets his Canon S95. The thing is he already had his iPhone 4S on him. So I asked him why he did that. "The S95 takes better low-light pictures," is what he said.</p>
<p>The iPhone 4S has a pretty good camera, but the top point-and-shoots are still better. So I made a prediction: "The iPhone 5, if Apple pushes the camera sub-system like I think Apple will, will make most point-and-shoots obsolete." I'm waiting for <a href="/2012/01/06/2012-predictions/">the next iPhone</a> to get my next camera.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/14/2775567/canon-powershot-g1-x-review">David Pierce, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even Canon&acirc;&euro;&trade;s own PowerShot S100 and S95 take stellar pictures, have slightly faster lenses than the G1 X, and both are legitimately pocketable cameras &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; those seem like better portable companions to a DSLR. Too many choices is never a bad thing for camera buyers, but I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m not sure the G1 X stands out enough from its competitors to be worth the premium.</blockquote></p>
