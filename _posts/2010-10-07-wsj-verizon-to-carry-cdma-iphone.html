<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703735804575536191649347572.html">The Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>AT&T Inc. is about to lose its lock on the iPhone.</p>
<p>Apple Inc. is making a version of its iPhone that Verizon Wireless will sell early next year, according to people familiar with the matter, ending an exclusive deal with AT&T and sharpening the competition with Google Inc.-based phones.</blockquote></p>
<p>If true, that would also mean more carriers in Korea and Japan will be able to sell the CDMA iPhone. I would be quite excited to see SK Telecom, the best in Korea in my opinion, carry the iPhone.</p>
