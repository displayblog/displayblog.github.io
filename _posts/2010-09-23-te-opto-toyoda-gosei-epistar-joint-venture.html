<p>Toyoda Gosei brings technology to the LED table while Epistar brings low-cost manufacturing. TE Opto, the joint venture between the two companies, will be established on November 1st. Toyoda will have 51%, Epistar 40%, and Town Hill 9% of shares. Great technology with aggressive pricing sounds like a winning strategy.
