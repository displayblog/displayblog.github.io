<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-31/sony-toshiba-hitachi-to-merge-lcd-businesses-form-state-backed-venture.html">Bloomberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sony Corp. (6758), Toshiba Corp. (6502) and Hitachi Ltd. (6501) agreed to divest their liquid-crystal display businesses to a government-backed fund amid mounting competition from South Korean and Taiwanese producers.</blockquote></p>
<p>Innovation Network Corp. of Japan (INCJ) will own 70% of Japan Display K.K. after an investment of &yen;200 billion. Sony, Toshiba, and Hitachi will divide up the remaining 30%. Japan Display will use the infusion of capital to construct new display production facilities.</p>
