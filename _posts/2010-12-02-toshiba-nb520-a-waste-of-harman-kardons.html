<p>The Toshiba NB520 is a 10.1-inch netbook and packs two 2-watt Harman Kardon speakers, which are wasted.</p>
<p>Great audio adds to the experience of watching movies, but the 10.1-inch LCD lacks pixels: 1024x600. Forget HD. At a cafe? You'll probably want to put on headphones. And at home you'd turn on the stereo for music, the TV for movies, or the desktop for HD stuff online. So what good are these supposedly great Harman Kardon speakers on a netbook?</p>
<p>PS: Is that perforated leather? I can get used to that, but they probably aren't.</p>
