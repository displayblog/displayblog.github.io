<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/12/13/sharp-integrated-cognitive-creation-60-inch-4k-lcd-goes-from-p/">Engadget</a>. <a href="http://www.sharp.co.jp/corporate/news/121213-a-2.html">Sharp</a> (Japanese): 4K is upon us, for a price. The Sharp ICC PURIOS LC-60HQ10 is a 60-inch 4K LCD TV with a 3840x2160 pixel format, with a unique technology.</p>
<p>ICC stands for Integrated Cognitive Creation, which was developed by I-cubed Research Center. ICC is a fancy name for: "We want you to feel like you're seeing the real thing." How? By using real-world optical signals, not electrical ones, to form pictures with perspective, three-dimensionality, and texture that are as close to the real world as possible. In other words, screen resolution (ppi) changes depending on where the object is located within a picture. For example, let's consider a house across a 100 meter bridge. The part of the bridge closest to you will have the highest resolution, the house lowest, and parts of the bridge in the middle. This suggests the TV understands perspective and that's probably why the word 'cognitive' has been used. Here are some hardware specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Size: 60 inches</li>
<li>Pixel Format: 3840x2160</li>
<li>Contrast: 700:1</li>
<li>Viewing Angle: 176/176</li>
<li>Backlight: LED</li><br />
</ul><br />
And the price: &yen;2.62 million or about US$31,000. Available February 20, 2013. <em>Hat tip to Paul S.!</em></p>
