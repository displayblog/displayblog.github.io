<p>Sony's new VGN-N17L, unlike the name might suggest, has a 15.4" LCD instead of a 17". There isn't much information out there about the VGN-N17L, but from looking at the pictures at Akihabara News, the way the keyboard has been designed into the design is very similar to Apple's PowerBooks. Some have noted the resemblance to the MacBooks, but from my point of view there isn't much similarity there aside from the color. The keyboard on a MacBook is very unique and somewhat less usable than a typically-designed keyboard.</p>

<p>The marketing departments of Sony and Samsung (among others such as LG) are doing a very good job of taking photographs that try to bring these beautiful machines into regular surroundings. Of course not everyone's surrounding has a beautiful person such as in the picture.</p>
