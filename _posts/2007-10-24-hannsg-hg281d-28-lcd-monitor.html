<p>Hanns.G is a subsidiary of Hannspree, the name behind some very intriguing consumer electronics designs. Hanns.G's HG281D is a fairly large 28" LCD monitor that has the same pixel format (1920 x 1200) as that of much smaller ones. Recently, Lenovo announced a 22" with the same 1920 x 1200 pixel format. So, what's the big deal? Well, it's big and that means fonts will be much easier on your eyes. Second, you can have this monster of a monitor for under $700! You have both VGA and HDMI inputs, so you can use this as a 1080p TV or a monitor. <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/print_article2/0,1217,a=217920,00.asp">ExtremeTech</a> seems to knock the HG281D because it doesn't have any USB ports, but who the heck needs USB ports when you have wireless USB just around the corner or when a simple and cheap USB hub will do. They also think that there is an optimum color temperature when in fact color temperatures vary from brand to brand and from geographic region to geographic region. For instance, Sony tweaks the color temperature a bit cooler than average while LG Electronics does the opposite. Anyway, if you're not a color snob, and you appreciate larger fonts, a great price and the flexibility to use it as a TV, the HG281D sounds like a good deal.</p>
