<p><a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/05/19/mistake-one">Marco Arment</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I hate typing on it, I hate the trackpad, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s slower than I expected, the screen is noticeably blurry from non-native scaling to get reasonable screen space, and I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t even find it very comfortable to use in my lap because it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>too</em> small.</blockquote></p>
<p>Non-native scaling will always be blurry, compared to native scaling. In <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2015/04/17/2015-macbook/">my initial observation of the 2015 MacBook</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is one thing about the MacBook that is weird: the hardware-level pixel format is 2304&Atilde;&mdash;1440, but you can only run it as high as 1440&Atilde;&mdash;900.</blockquote></p>
<p>Just look at that ugly number: 2304. Couldn't make it 2560? Or if hitting a 16:10 aspect ratio was so important, why not go all the way to 2560x1600? Would have been tidy, and standard.</p>
<p>Speaking of keyboards and trackpads: More travel, not less. I know this is over the top, but I'd like a mechanical keyboard in a laptop. Like the good old days. And the trackpad on my 2009 MacBook Pro is failing. My two cents: make the trackpad simpler, so it can last longer, and if it breaks easily fixable. This new trackpad on the 2015 MacBook looks quite complex and I bet replacing it when it breaks will be expensive.</p>
<blockquote><p>This concerns me more than you probably think it should. Not only does it represent compromised standards in areas I believe are important, but it suggests that they don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have many better ideas to advance the products beyond making them thinner, and they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re willing to sacrifice anything to keep that going.</blockquote></p>
<p>Nailed it.</p>
