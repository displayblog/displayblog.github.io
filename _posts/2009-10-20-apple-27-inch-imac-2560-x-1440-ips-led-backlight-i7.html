  The new iMacs come in two sizes: 21.5-inch and 27-inch. I'll concentrate on the

  left over. You can do that with 1920 x 1080 but a lot of websites are designed with
  a width of 1024 that requires horizontal scrolling, which I don't like at all. I
  am not 100% happy that Apple has decided to go 16:9 but I'll have to face reality:
  the iMac is a consumer-oriented product and so 16:9 was inevitable. You can watch

  Blu-ray title in full window mode within a window! That's how many pixels there
  are on the 27-inch. The LCD is also class-leading and very bright at 375 cd/m2. "

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>GPU</strong> You can power the quad-core 27-inch iMac with ATI's blazing fast Radeon HD 4850 GPU with 512MB of GDDR3 memory. You can step down the GPU on the dual-core 27-inch to a Radeon HD 4670 with 256MB. You can connect a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=30-inch&amp;sa=Search#1379">30-inch</a> monitor (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=2560+x+1600&amp;sa=Search#1379">2560 x 1600</a> resolution) to the 27-inch iMac and run both displays simultaneously at full resolution. The 27-inch iMac can also act as an external display accepting an external DisplayPort source.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>CPU</strong> There are two kinds of quad-cores on the 27-inch: 2.66GHz i5 or the 2.8GHz i7. Plus you can combine the ultrafast i7 with up to 16GB of memory!</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Connectivity</strong> You get WiFi ABGN, Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR and Gigabit Ethernet. There is one FireWire 800, four USB 2.0 and a SD card slot. I guess in Apple's mind external memory storage is moving toward a single standard: SD.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Ultimate</strong> The new iMac with the 27-inch IPS LCD with LED backlight and 2560 x 1440 resolution coupled with one of the fastest CPUs (i7) around make it as close to ultimate as you can get in an all-in-one.</p></p>
