<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20090918PD206.html">DigiTimes</a> is reporting that industry sources are expecting 2-3M LCD TVs to be sold during the National Day holiday in China. This optimism is based on large LCD TV sales during previous holidays. Here are some facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Labor Day (May): 1.36M units, up 75% Y/Y</li>
<li>Dragon Boat Festival (May): ?M units, up 94% Y/Y</li>
<li>First half of 2009: Up 65% Y/Y</li><br />
</ul><br />
And then some expectations:</p>
<ul>
<li>National Day (October): 2-3M units expected</li>
<li>Popular sizes during the holiday: 32-inch (less than US$400) and 42-inch (less than US$800)</li>
<li>CY2009: 22-25M units expected</li><br />
</ul><br />
42-inch LCD TVs are already around US$650. An example is <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=lg&amp;sa=Search">LG</a>'s 42LH20, a 720p 42-inch LCD TV, selling for just <a href="http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=4636759&amp;Sku=L49-4254%20BX">US$649.99 at TigerDirect</a> at the time of this writing. On the same site you can also find a Sylvania LD320SS8, a 32-inch 720p LCD TV, for just US$349.99. If major TV brands aggressively drop prices during China's National Day holiday to lower than even these mentioned, not buying a LCD TV might be hard to resist for Chinese consumers.</p>
