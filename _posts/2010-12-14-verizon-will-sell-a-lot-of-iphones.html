<p>John Gruber at <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/12/14/frommer-verizon-iphone">Daring Fireball</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If AT&T can sell 14 million iPhones in four quarters (selling to a base of subscribers who&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve had the iPhone available to them since 2007) why wouldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t Verizon (selling to a base of subscribers who&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve been starved of the iPhone) be able to sell more? I expect Verizon to sell more iPhones than AT&T does.</blockquote></p>
<p>Gruber is probably right, especially if the next iPhone uses Verizon's LTE network. That means much faster connections to the Internet and more reliable calls, but it also means messier bills.</p>
