<p>Lots of LG related news today! Here's another one: LG Electronics unveiled its limited edition, 18-karat gold Iron Man slider mobile phone on April 2 during the CTIA Wireless conference in Las Vegas. Unfortunately, the Iron Man phone will not be sold in stores and will be used as part of Paramount Pictures' promotion campaign for the Marvel Studios film Iron Man, which will be in theaters on May 2. I'm definitely going to watch Iron Man! You can, however, try to win yourself a LG Iron Man phone (just 100 will be made) that's reportedly worth about $2000 by visiting <a href="http://www.insidethesuit.com">www.insidethesuit.com</a>. At the time of this writing, this site is under construction and simply says, "Coming Soon..."</p>

LG's Iron Man phone is a customized LG Shine (KE970) but with the bling-bling 18-karat gold covering. Unfortunately, that doesn't quite do it for me. The Iron Man is about really advanced technology. Gold? That's not really advanced. If the LG Shine was covered using some really cool metals that makes it nearly indestructible and/or sported some advanced display technology such as a mirrored touch LCD, face/voice recognition, etc., that would have done much more in developing some excitement over the product. 18-karat gold? Blah.<br />
