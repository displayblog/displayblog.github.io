<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=msi">MSI</a>'s Wind netbook is not available yet. But OS X 10.5.2 has been loaded on to it. Now you have a $399 (plus OS X 10.5.2 license cost) <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=os-x">OS X</a> netbook! Pretty crazy cool.</p>

<p>Every time OS X is installed onto a PC of some sort, I am tempted to try to install OS X onto my own <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dell">Dell</a> Inspiron 9300. I've failed several times and I don't know why I keep trying. I think it might have to do with the fact that I can get a OS X system for practically nothing. It also has something to do with the fact that I'll need to spend at least $1099 to get a new OS X <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=notebook-pc">notebook PC</a>. The choice is between many trial and error (most error) sessions and hoping that one day it'll work or fork over $1099. After a few more failed attempts, I might just go out and get a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=macbook">MacBook</a>.</p>
