  HD viewing. Although the 16:9 aspect ratio is familiar as in HD, the resolution
  is worthless. 1600 x 900 is not 1280 x 720 as in <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=720p&amp;sa=Search\">720p</a>

  Full HD. Everything HD will need to be both scaled vertically <em>and</em> horizontally

  Oh really? Do we really want executives to be purchasing really expensive notebook
  PCs? And ones that have a 16:9 screens so they can watch HD content? In this day
  and age where executive pay at financial institutions is being determined by the
  president because they are deemed too excessive, why is Dell trying to sell a really
  expensive notebook PC with what seems to be an HD focus? You want these overpaid
  executives to watch HD shows and movies on their Zs?\r\n\r\n<strong>Matte</strong>
  There is one good thing about this premium ultra super duper high definition A plus
  LED whatever LCD: it is matte! We're going back to matte and it is finally time.

<p><strong>Matte</strong> There is one good thing about this premium ultra super duper high definition A plus LED whatever LCD: it is matte! We're going back to matte and it is finally time. After the break: No Wires Ma!, Two Brains, Ugly Butt.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-7202"></a></p>
<p><strong>No Wires Ma!</strong> The Z has wireless charging and wireless external display connectivity. The Z has built-in power coils in the base of the notebook and charges wirelessly via a magnetic inductive stand (a $200 option). Wow. But wait. What if you want to charge it but don't want it on the stand? You'll need to go wire. I usually work on my notebook and its flat on the desk. The Z also makes use of Ultra Wide Band (UWB) wireless technology: a $200 wireless dock allows you to connect all of your wireless peripherals. And the dock connects via UWB to the Z. Very cool.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-7206 aligncenter" title="Dell_Latitude_Z_16inch_Notebook_Front" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Dell_Latitude_Z_16inch_Notebook_Front.jpg" alt="Dell_Latitude_Z_16inch_Notebook_Front" width="559" height="348" /></p></p>
<p><strong>Two Brains</strong> The Z has two CPUs: one for the power-hungry Windows and the other for Dell's Latitude-On. The later gives you access to email and a browser without booting into Windows and is powered by an ARM CPU. The Intel ULV CPU powers regular Windows. I wonder how long the battery lasts...</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7205" title="Dell_Latitude_Z_16inch_Notebook" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Dell_Latitude_Z_16inch_Notebook.png" alt="Dell_Latitude_Z_16inch_Notebook" width="490" height="381" /></p>
<p><strong>Ugly Butt</strong> Does the bezel around the LCD need to be so thick? The bezel on the bottom is thick enough for me to wonder if someone hit the Z with an ugly stick. Twice. I would rather forgo the touch capability on the bezel for a thinner one. Add to the thick bezel the way the LCD opens and you've got some challenges opening this thing up in a plane. Instead of the LCD sliding down like it does on Apple's MacBook notebook PCs, the Z sits on top of the chassis requiring a bit of height. And the big bulge in the back! I would have gotten completely rid of that horrendous butt. Instead Dell attempted to make it into the focal point of the Z's product design. Sigh.</p>
<p><strong>Puzzling</strong> The Latitude Z from Dell is quite impressive in many ways. It is the first notebook PC to feature wireless charging and wireless peripheral connectivity via UWB (both expensive options). I also think it's the first notebook to sport two CPUs. There are other technical features but it feels as though the company slapped a lot of technology together without a singular theme to the Z: Why on earth would I want to reach out and touch the right bezel of the LCD to open up some applications? 1600 x 900? Puzzling. Wireless charging is great but on a stand that lifts it up and forces you to use an external keyboard, mouse and monitor? And to do that I need to spend an extra $200 to do it wirelessly? And finally why the ugly butt?</p>
