<p>Most 20" monitors have a pixel format of 1600 x 1200 with a 4:3 aspect ratio. The new wide versions are 16:10 with a 1680 x 1050 pixel format.</p>

<p>One of the most popular 20" wide LCD monitors is Dell's 2007WFP. I just checked Dell's site (Home &amp; Home Office) and the price is <a href="http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;cs=19&amp;sku=320-4688">$390.15 </a> before any coupons. It is still a bit expensive for some, but I think it's a very good value for the majority. Viewsonic wanted to offer a 20"-class LCD monitor for a bit less.</p>
<p>Viewsonic has come out with a cheaper 20" solution by dropping the resolution to 1400 x 1050. The aspect ratio is 4:3, so that stays the same. I did a quick <a href="http://www.pricegrabber.com/p__ViewSonic_20_VG2021M_Analog_Digital_LCD_Monitor,__19271031/sort_type=price">PriceGrabber</a> price search and the cheapest price seems to be roughly in the $330 range supplied by one of the top merchants (<a href="http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=232503&amp;affiliate=pricegrabber">ZipZoomfly</a>).</p>
<p>Is a $60 premium worth the wide and the extra resolution of 200 additional horizontal pixels? I think so, especially when you add a coupon or two to drop the price down to around $350.</p>
<p>Now this is still an up-in-the-air topic and anything could happen. I'm talking about Vista and high-resolution support. If my fonts are going to simply look better without getting smaller when I use higher-resolution displays with Vista, I would seriously consider purchasing a new LCD monitor with as many pixels as I can afford. In this case, if I had to choose between the Dell 2007WFP and the Viewsonic VG2021M, I'd go for the Dell. Plus, it's wide!</p>
