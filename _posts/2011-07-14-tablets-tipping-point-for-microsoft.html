<p><a href="http://www.asymco.com/2011/07/14/is-the-tablet-computer-a-new-pc-or-post-pc">Horace Dediu</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The picture that emerges is that while Windows continues to be dominant with 84% of units sold in the last quarter, the growth belongs to tablets which captured about 90% of it. If Windows remains marginal on tablets, the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;PC market&acirc;&euro;¬ù will likely tip away from Microsoft in two years (depending on how quickly Apple can build iPads.)</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/07/14/we-view-a-tablet-as-sort-of-pc/">Microsoft thinks a tablet is a sort of PC</a>. Apple thinks otherwise. The result for the second quarter: 90% of growth in the PC market was due to tablets, which is dominated by the iPad.</p>
