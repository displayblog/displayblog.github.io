<blockquote><p>Yes, I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m leaving Engadget as well. In fact, I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m already gone &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; my last day was March 4th. I hadn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t told anyone in order to afford our team the chance to transition in relative peace and quiet. Not that there&acirc;&euro;&trade;s anything quiet about an Engadget workday.</blockquote></p>
