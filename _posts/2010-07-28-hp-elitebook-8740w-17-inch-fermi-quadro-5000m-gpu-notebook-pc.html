<p><a href="http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF06a/321957-321957-64295-3740645-3955549-4138087.html">HP</a>: The Fermi-based Quadro 5000M GPU has been stuffed into HP's EliteBook 8740w, a very expensive 17-inch notebook PC that starts at US$2,676. The Quadro 5000M sports 2GB of VRAM and 320 CUDA cores. The 8740w can be maxed out with 16GB of RAM and Intel's Core i7 Extreme Edition, internally. Externally the crazy mobile box is ruggedized and isn't phased by vibration, dust, humidity, altitude and extreme temperatures. You need to render the next Avatar in extreme conditions? The HP EliteBook 8740w might be the best notebook PC available. Unless...</p>
<p>Unless you need you need pixels. HP decides to use acronyms that don't mean much of anything. What is WXGA+? I'm guessing it is 1440x900. And if it is the EliteBook 8740w isn't elite at all. The pixel format isn't even 1680x1050 let alone 1920x1080 or even 1920x1200. You need the 8740w to render? It's got the power but the display is not up to the task, at all.</p>
