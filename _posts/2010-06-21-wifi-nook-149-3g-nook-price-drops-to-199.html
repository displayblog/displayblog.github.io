<p>A WiFi-only NOOK (model number BNRV100) has been confirmed and priced at US$149 by Barnes &amp; Noble. For more detailed info check out the complete <a href="http://www.barnesandnobleinc.com/press_releases/2010_june_21_nook_wifi.html">press release</a>. The price of the 3G-capable NOOK has dropped $60 to $199. There is also an updated firmware (version 1.4) that allows free connections to AT&amp;T's wireless hotspots. The WiFi-only Nook is available as of today. I look forward to even more affordable e-book readers in the near future.</p>
