<blockquote><p>The big sticking point will inevitably be the resistive touchscreen. Before the moaning starts, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not too bad &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; after a long time with capacitive smartphones it does take some adjusting but we were playing Angry Birds in no time, and the optional stylus helps a lot. Yes, we&acirc;&euro;&trade;d prefer capacitive; yes, we&acirc;&euro;&trade;d prefer multitouch; but it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not the deal-breaker it&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll be made out to be. Tasks that require a lot of swiping and dragging may soon come to grate, and the fixed buttons at the foot of the screen were also a little unresponsive, but this wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t the final firmware so we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll reserve judgement until we get our finished review sample.</blockquote></p>
<p>Not all resistive touchscreens are bad. Statum's solution is quite good actually. Read <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/09/11/stantum-resistive-multitouch/"><em>Stantum: Resistive Multitouch</em></a>. But something tells me the resistive technology used in these Creative ZiiO tablets isn't that great. Not only that touch is not multitouch. Who doesn't do multitouch these days?</p>
<p>The 7-inch version is limited to just 800x480; that's less than what we see on the 3.5-inch iPhone 4's LCD rocking 960x640. At least the 7-inch 8GB ZiiO is cheap: just &Acirc;&pound;200 including VAT and &Acirc;&pound;220 for the 16GB version. The larger 10-inch sports a 1024x600 pixel format and goes for &Acirc;&pound;250 (8GB) and &Acirc;&pound;270 (16GB). Both are very cheap but not all cheap stuff are worth it.</p>
