<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/12/27/lg-bringing-worlds-largest-led-backlit-3d-lcd-hdtv-to-ces-72-i/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[LG will] be bringing the planet's largest LED-backlit 3D LCD HDTV to CES 2011 next week, with the LZ9700 handling both 2D and 3D content and offering TruMotion 400Hz [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>Who cares about 3D? I don't. But actually, my sister mentioned how fantastic it was to watch <em>How to Train Your Dragon</em> on a 3D TV with active-shutter glasses. I must say I did enjoy watching Avatar in the theaters in 3D, but I also enjoyed watching Avatar in 2D just as much. If you are a 3D fan, and there are only a few of you out there, and if you have the space and the financial wherewithal to purchase the largest 72-inch LED-backlit 3D LCD TV in the world, then maybe the LG LZ9700 is something to look forward to.</p>
<p>Two things: what is with that brownish neck? And Dvorak says <a href="/2010/09/24/dvorak-3d-bad-for-your-eyes/">3D is bad for your kid's optical nerves</a>.</p>
