<p><img src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/lenovo_thinkpad_x1_133_ultraslim_notebook_pc.jpg" alt="" title="lenovo_thinkpad_x1_133_ultraslim_notebook_pc" width="449" height="70" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19565" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www1.partnerinfo.lenovo.com/us/en/pdf/US_Channel_Update_041311.pdf">Lenovo (PDF)</a>: The ThinkPad X1 is a 13.3-inch ultra-thin notebook PC with a thickness of just 21.5 mm (0.85 inches). The LED backlit LCD with a 1366x768 pixel format is covered by Corning's Gorilla Glass. Comparisons to the Apple MacBook Air and the Samsung Series 9 come naturally since both are ultra-thin and ultra-light 13.3-inch notebooks.</p>
<p>Ranking based on thickness:</p>
<ol>
<li>Samsung Series 9: 0.64 inches</li>
<li>13.3-inch MacBook Air: 0.11 - 0.68 inches</li>
<li>Lenovo ThinkPad X1: 0.65 - 0.85 inches</li><br />
</ol></p>
<p>In terms of weight, the ranking is the same:</p>
<ol>
<li>Samsung Series 9: 2.89 pounds</li>
<li>13.3-inch MacBook Air: 2.90 pounds</li>
<li>Lenovo ThinkPad X1: 3 - 3.8 pounds</li><br />
</ol></p>
<p>In terms of pixel density, or resolution, the MacBook Air with a pixel format of 1440x900 good for 128 ppi beats the other two's 118 ppi.</p>
<p>There is a unique feature on the X1 called RapidCharge, a battery technology that recharges the non-removeable battery to 80% in just 30 minutes. That's mighty impressive.</p>
<p>But at the end the ThinkPad X1 outclasses itself with a price of &#8355;2585 (about US$2919). The Samsung Series 9 looks comparatively cheap at just $1650. Interestingly the MacBook Air from Apple, often criticized for being overpriced, is the cheapest among the three, by a good margin: the base model starts at $1299.</p>
