<blockquote><p>Here&acirc;&euro;&trade;s one great example, shared by sound designer Jim McKee on <a href="http://99percentinvisible.org/post/3230995265/episode-15-the-sound-of-the-artificial-world">the 99% Invisible Podcast</a>. The sound of your iPhone or iPad unlocking itself? It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s actually the sound a vice grip makes opening itself up.</blockquote></p>
<p>The podcast is short and sweet. Listen to it and then unlock your iPhone; it's pretty nifty.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.02.22:</em> Speaking of digital sensory signals. <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1817965/martin-lindstrom-buyology-marketing-personal-touch-sensory-cues">Martin Lindstrom, Fast Company</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Having worked with sensory signals throughout my career, I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve come to appreciate how the smallest sensory details can have the greatest impact. Take, for example, the sound and feel of opening a bottle of water. You&acirc;&euro;&trade;re at least subconsciously familiar with the subtle click of a breaking seal. However, let&acirc;&euro;&trade;s say you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re in India, where the water bottles open silently. When I heard about the absence of the subtle click, I questioned the safety of the water. Apparently I wasn't alone: I remember reading about a competitive water bottler who took advantage of this, changed the top so that it clicks, and gained a competitive advantage in the water market place. People believe the water is safer.</blockquote></p>
