<p><a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/5606/razer-blade-review/9">AnandTech</a>: The Razer Blade sports a matte 17.3-inch AUO B173HW01 V.5 LCD. Great contrast ratio and color gamut, but brightness and color accuracy were lacking. Vivek Gowri and Jarred Walton:</p>
<blockquote><p>My only real complaint is that in a notebook of this caliber, it would have been nice to see an IPS display.</blockquote></p>
