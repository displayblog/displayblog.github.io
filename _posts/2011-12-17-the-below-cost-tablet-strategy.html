<p><a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/135844/why-the-ipad-is-the-most-hated-gadget-ever/">Mike Elgan, Cult of Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the under-appreciated reality of all this: HP, RIM and Amazon have all moved millions of touch tablets into the market at below cost. This has caused two problems for the market. First, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s created a domino effect. HP&acirc;&euro;&trade;s fire sale on the TouchPad cut demand for the BlackBerry PlayBook, reducing unit sales. That contributed to RIM&acirc;&euro;&trade;s need for a fire sale of its own. (Plus, Amazon has probably long intended to sell below cost.)</p>
<p>All this crazy, unexpected discounting has both artificially taken market share away from the various Android tablets, and re-set consumer expectations about how much a touch tablet is supposed to cost.</p>
<p>Now, the only way to sell a non-iPad tablet in any significant quantity is to sell it below cost.</blockquote></p>
<p>One important point has been left out. The only way to hit price points significantly lower than US$499 is to build tablets that are much smaller than 9.7 inches. 8.9-inch tablets are 0.8 inches smaller, but cost $400; these tablets are in a dead zone. To get the price way down and completely away from competing against the iPad the display size needs to come all the way down to 7 inches. And at that size the price has been set at $199 by Amazon and Barnes & Noble. Both companies are probably losing money selling at that price, but both plan to recuperate the losses by selling content <em>via</em> their tablets. Brands like LG or Samsung have enough financial wherewithal to compete in the money losing 7-inch tablet market, but they don't have a content store the likes of Amazon and Barnes & Noble, and it will be almost impossible to make money in the long run.</p>
