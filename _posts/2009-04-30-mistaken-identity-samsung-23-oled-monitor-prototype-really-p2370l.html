<p><strong>Mistake</strong> The post about <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/04/29/samsung-23-oled-monitor-prototype/">Samsung's 23" OLED monitor prototype</a> that featured on megawhat.tv seems to be the result of a mistaken identity. Unfortunate: I was getting quite excited there for a second. There are many reasons for why the 23" OLED monitor is most likely a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=23%22+lcd+monitor&amp;sa=Search#1585">23" LCD monitor</a> with a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=led+backlight&amp;sa=Search#1693">LED backlight</a>. The reasons are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Energy Star sticker: I don't think Energy Star approves prototypes.</li>
<li>No PR from Samsung: A 23" OLED monitor would be big news. And Samsung would be milking it! But there is absolute silence...</li>
<li>1.6cm thickness: That's thin, but thick for an OLED display. It should be 1/10 of that.</li>
<li>Viewing angles: Picture quality washes out when looked from the side; OLEDs don't do that, but most LCDs do.</li><br />
</ul><br />
Ron at <a href="http://www.oled-info.com/samsung-23-oled-monitor-video-fake">OLED-Info</a> picked up on these clues. The 23" OLED monitor is probably <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/01/13/ces-2009-samsung-p2370l-23-lcd-monitor-with-led-backlight/">Samsung's P2370L</a>. The P2370L also has a dynamic contrast ratio of 2,000,000:1, sports a LED backlight and is 1.65cm thick.</p>
