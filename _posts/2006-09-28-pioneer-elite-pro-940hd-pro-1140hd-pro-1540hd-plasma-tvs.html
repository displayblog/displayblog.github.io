<em>Pioneer Elite PRO-1140HD</em></p>
<p>Technologies that these three plasma TVs have:</p>
<p>First Surface PRO Color Filter: Improves contrast ration via a newly designed glass and provides more detail in dark scenese.</p>
<p>Redesigned Deep Encased Cell Structure: The red and blue phosphors have been improved resulting in more brightness.</p>
<p>Crystal Emissive Layer: This layer is bonded directly to the plasma glass that results in more panel efficiency (brighter) and results in better contrast.</p>
<p>Home Media Gallery: These three Elite plasma TVs are the first to have this feature that allows connection to a home network via Ethernet or USB and gives direct access to movies, music and photos that are accessible on the network.</p>
<p>Other features include a built-in NTSC and ATSC tuners, two HDMI inputs, CableCARD, and 60,000-hour lifetime (20 years at 8 hours per day). When all is said and done, these &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Elite&acirc;&euro;¬ù plasma TVs are not all that elite. First of all, the PRO-940HD has a resolution of 1024 x 768&acirc;&euro;&ldquo;this isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t even HD. How can you display 720p HD content that has a resolution of 1280 x 768 on this? You can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t, unless you scale it down. PRO? Laughable. Also, if you really want an elegant interface that links up a HD TV to networked multmedia, wait for Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s iTV.</p>
