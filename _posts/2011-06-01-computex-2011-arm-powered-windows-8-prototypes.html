<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/01/microsoft-reveals-arm-powered-windows-8-prototypes/">Engadget</a>: Foxconn, Quanta, and Wistron unveiled Windows 8 prototypes at Computex 2011 powered by chips from Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, and NVIDIA. Although Microsoft is going about it the wrong way by forcing brands to initially work with a single chip supplier, I think Windows 8 will be on everything: netbooks, smartbooks, ultrabooks, notebooks, tablets, desktops, etc.</p>
