<p>I have never heard of Walsin Technology Corporation (WTC) before. WTC is a component maker based in Taiwan. Back in April, WTC opened a new R&amp;D center in Kaohsiung, Taiwan to research high-capacitance multi-layer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs). Just as a side note, RoHS complaint capacitors require lead to be absent and has pushed manufacturers to use a pure tin plating and without lead in the termination. The R&amp;D center is roughly 40,000 square feet and will cost about US$62 million.</p>
<p>WTC will focus on X5R material based MLCCs at the new R&amp;D center. Currently, most Taiwanese passive-component makers are using Y5V material to produce high-capacitance MLCCs. Most Japanese manufacturers such as Taiyo Yuden are already using X5R material for their MLCCs. Yageo, a Taiwan-based competitor to WTC, will be concentrating on X5R MLCCs in 2006 comprising 80% of MLCC production. But I digress...</p>
<p>PSA, for Passive System Alliance, is the brand that WTC will be using for its LCD monitors. WTC will be working with HannStar Entertainment starting this month. HannStar Entertainment had a previous working relationship with CMO to distribute two of its brands: CMV and PolyView but CMO discontinued that relationship.
