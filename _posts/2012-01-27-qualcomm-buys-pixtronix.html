<p><a href="http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4235298/Qualcomm-buys-MEMS-display-startup">Petere Clarke, EE Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Pixtronix display &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; called PerfectLight &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; is based on a MEMS-based digital micro shutter that modulates light from an RGB LED backlight. A high switching speed makes it suitable for applications ranging from full-speed video to e-reader operation and Pixtronix claimed that the display offered greater than 170 degree viewing angles, more than 3,000:1 contrast ratio and 24-bit color depth at one quarter of the power consumption of equivalent size and resolution liquid crystal displays.</blockquote></p>
<p>Full color, video capable, affordable tablets that last four times as long. Sounds good.</p>
