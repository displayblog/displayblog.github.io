<p>On June 24 Research In Motion (RIM) announced first quarter results ended on May 29, 2010. The main highlight was that BlackBerry smartphone shipments grew 43% Y/Y to 11.2 million pushing the cumulative total number of BlackBerry shipments to over 100 million. BlackBerry subscribers also increased 60% Y/Y to 46 million with 4.9 million new ones added in the first quarter. Read the <a href="http://www.rim.com/investors/documents/pdf/pressrelease/2011/Q1_press_release.pdf">press release</a> (PDF) for more details. Even with tremendous buzz and demand for Apple's iPhone 4 it seems the enterprise continues to favor the BlackBerry from RIM. Not surprising, for now.</p>
