<p>Just a quick note on the displays that NEC is using on its N902iX flip-phone: 1" external LCD with 120 x 90 resolution that can display 65K colors. The main display is a 2.5" 345 x 240 (a bit weird, but NEC calls it QVGA+, the "+" adds 5 additional rows) and is able to display 262K colors. The main display has an oustanding color gamut of 72% NTSC. This is something that I haven't seen on actual manufactured mobile phones. I have seen 72% NTSC display modules at trade shows however. Good stuff NEC. Source: <a href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS3110082615.html">Linux Devices</a></p>
