<blockquote><p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;What we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re dealing with is small green tomatoes,&acirc;&euro; he said of the Gear&acirc;&euro;&trade;s first-generation growing pains. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;And what we want to do is take care of them and work with them so they become big, red ripe tomatoes. And what you want to be sure of is that you don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t pluck the green tomato too early and you want to make sure that you don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t criticize a small green tomato for not being a big, red ripe tomato.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>The problem for Samsung is that consumers ponying up US$300 for it wants it to be big, red, and ripe.</p>
