<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/17/2955185/dolby-glasses-free-3d-prototype-philips-hands-on">David Pierce, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dolby is <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/12/2943695/dolby-phillips-glasses-free-HD-3D-format">working with Philips</a> to manufacture the displays, which use a sheet of undulated plastic to deflect pixels in various directions &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; there are 26 different viewing angles in all. Because the image is being sent in so many directions at once, the display has to be incredibly high-resolution to look good (the prototype was a quad-HD TV), which is why Dolby reps said the same impressive viewing angles are going to be harder to achieve on smaller devices like smartphones. The companies are waiting for the higher-res displays to be more mainstream, and less expensive.</blockquote></p>
<p>Higher resolution LCD TVs are coming and their prices will fall; it's a matter of when not if. 3D should move away from having to wear glasses, permanently.</p>
