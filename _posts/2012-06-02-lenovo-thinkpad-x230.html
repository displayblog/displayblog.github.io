<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/1/3055686/lenovo-thinkpad-x230-review">Nate Ralph, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The 12.5-inch display, by contrast, is excellent. The 300-nit matte IPS panel is a regular, welcome guest on Lenovo&acirc;&euro;&trade;s ThinkPad X series (it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the same display that appeared on the X220, actually), and it doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t disappoint. The horizontal and vertical viewing angles are generously wide, and text and images remained clear and decipherable at all angles. The screen is also fairly visible outdoors in bright, direct sunlight. There is one caveat: the X230 is cursed with the same 1366 x 768 resolution as its predecessor. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d love to see a higher resolution panel attached to this keyboard (and the rest of the laptop, I suppose), but as it stands it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s just great.</blockquote></p>
<p>An IPS LCD on a notebook is rare, and the 125-ppi 12.5-inch LCD is no slouch, but a 1440x900 pixel format would have been perfect.</p>
