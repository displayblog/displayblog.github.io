<p>Alex Varanese marries 1970s design with modern technology with his project <a href="http://www.behance.net/Gallery/ALT1977-WE-ARE-NOT-TIME-TRAVELERS/545221">ALT/1977: We Are Not Time Travelers</a>. Here's what Varanese has to say about post-modern retro:</p>
<blockquote><p>The irony is that all post-modern, smugly self-referential retro porn aside, I'd gladly trade in my immaculately designed 21st century gadgets for these hideously clunky, faux-wood-paneled pieces of &Atilde;&frac14;ber-kitsch. Sorry, Apple.</blockquote></p>
<p>Ummm... nope, I'm keeping my immaculate Apple gear. But, there are many retro-cool ALT/1977 items and I like the Pocket Hi-Fi the best. Red LEDs!!!</p>
