<p>The Samsung P310ME Pocket Imager is the company's second generation mobile projector. Samsung's first was its SP-P300 that was released in late 2006. The P310ME feature a DLP chip with a pixel format of 800 x 600, which may sound a little less than standard, but the P310ME is very small and can easily fit on your hand. Not only is it small, it weighs just 1.5lbs. Frequent business travelers want, or need, less weight and if you've got a lot of presentations to make on the road, the SP-P310ME will help lighten your burden.</p>
<p>Reviews of the SP-P310ME is hard to come by. I found one from <a href="http://www.pricegrabber.ca/rating_getprodrev.php/product_id=63746028/id_type=masterid/st=product/sv=review">PriceGrabber</a> and three from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Pocket-Imager-P310-Projector/dp/B000OV3TJY/ref=pd_bbs_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1210019353&sr=8-1">Amazon</a>. The user on PriceGrabber seems to like that it is nearly silent and doesn't heat up all that much. The size and weight was not surprisingly a strong point as was the instant on and off feature. Now the weaknesses of the SP-P310ME is the brightness or lack thereof. Although the 16:9 aspect ratio is supported the user states that it isn't that great. Reviewers on Amazon also noted that because of the lack of brightness the SP-P310ME performs well in dark rooms.</p>
<p>If you want to get nitty-gritty into all the optical internals, there is a <a href="http://www.oscintl.com/Tear_Down_Reports/samsung_sp-p310ME.htm">tear-down report of the SP-P310 optical system</a> from Optical Short Course International (OSCI), but you'll need to pay $1495.</p>
