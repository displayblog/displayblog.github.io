<p><a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120807/samsungs-2010-report-on-how-its-galaxy-would-be-better-if-it-were-more-like-the-iphone/">John Paczkowski and Ina Fried, AllThings D</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Authored by Samsung&acirc;&euro;&trade;s product engineering team, the document evaluates everything from the home screen to the browser to the built in apps on both devices. In each case, it comes up with a recommendation on what Samsung should do going forward and in most cases its answer is simple: Make it work more like the iPhone.</blockquote></p>
<p>The document titled "Relative Evaluation Report on S1, iPhone" is available on <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/102317767/44">Scribd</a>. Samsung did not copy just the overall look of the iPhone, Samsung made the way it looks and functions more like the iPhone in every possible way.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.08.10:</em> Same goes for the <a href="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1288167/46.pdf">Behold 3</a> (PDF) also known as Vibrant.</p>
