<p><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/39227/">David Talbot, MIT Technology Review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>German researchers armed with smoking candles have come up with a cheap and easy way to coat surfaces so that oil droplets bounce or roll right off. The advance could eventually lead to eyeglass coatings and tablet computer screens that can evade the mark of even the greasiest fingerprints.</blockquote></p>
<p>Those "German researchers" are researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz. I wear eyeglasses so the thought of not having to clean off fingerprints is nice. Multitouch and cover glass on smartphones and tablets means dirtied displays with even more fingerprints. Hope these guys go from research to production sooner than later.</p>
