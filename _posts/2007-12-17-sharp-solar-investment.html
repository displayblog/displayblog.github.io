<p><span>On December 14, Sharp's Chairman Katsuhiko Machida announced that the company will be investing JPY100 billion ($US877 million) on a solar cell factory that will be located in Sakai, Osaka Prefecture. The solar cell factory will manufacture thin-film solar cells starting in fiscal 2009. With an annual production capacity of 1,000 million watts, Sharp's solar cell factory will be the world's largest. The solar cell factory will be adjacent to Sharp's G10 LCD fab that is currently under construction. Similar to LG.Philips LCD's Paju site where many suppliers have co-located with the firm's G7 LCD fab, Sharp is expected to have many suppliers co-located with its G10 LCD fab and its solar cell factory. </p>
<p><span>In other news, on November 26, Sharp announced that it is with Namaste Solar Electric to bring solar power to Colorado&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Nyland neighborhood, located in Lafayette. Nyland was built in 1990 as one of the first cohousing communities in the country. Namaste Solar will install 23 Sharp OnEnergy solar systems in the community by the end of 2007: 22 on homes, and one on the community-owned and operated Wood Shop. Sharp OnEnergy solar electric systems use a proprietary simplified, flexible mounting system to make installation faster, easier and more cost-effective. Nyland is a cohousing community of 42 private homes, built by Wonderland Hill Development Company, located in a rural setting six miles outside of Boulder, Colorado with an expansive view of the Rocky Mountains. There are approximately 135 resident members who share meals, meetings, workshops and miscellaneous events at the common house, a centerpiece of the neighborhood. Namaste Solar Electric is a values-based, employee owned solar electric company dedicated to the betterment of the planet by bringing clean, reliable, and affordable renewable energy technologies to homes, businesses, and nonprofits throughout the Front Range. Integrating both holistic and traditional business methods, Namaste Solar is currently the #1 solar electric company in Colorado with more than 350 solar electric systems installed since 2005. Namaste Solar's work at Nyland will offset more than 4100 tons of CO2. </p>
<p><span>Sharp's Solar Energy Solutions Group, based in Huntington Beach, California, is a unit of Sharp Electronics Corporation, the U.S. subsidiary of Sharp Corporation, Osaka, Japan.

<span>The picture above shows Sharp's Solar Racking System that is available on its OnEnergy packages. All lines and mounting hardware are significantly reduced and every component can be assembled using one socket for roof lags and one socket for bolts resulting in reduced installation time and helps to make servicing more convenient.</p>

<span>Cohousing is a type of collaborative housing that attempts to overcome the alienation of modern subdivisions in which no one knows his or her neighbors and resulting in a lack of sense of community. The typical cohousing community has 20 to 30 privately-owned, single-family homes arranged in a way to encourage interaction with neighbors. Interaction is encouraged through extensive commonly shared amenities like a common house, workshops, gardens and a greenhouse. The common house often includes a dining room and kitchen where residents prepare meals for each other on a rotating basis, a kids' playroom, guest rooms, craft room, exercise facility and meeting rooms. Cohousing communities are designed and managed by the residents as an intentional neighborhood where people are consciously committed to living as a community. Most cohousing communities share an environmental ethic with a commitment to "living gently on the land" in terms of building eco-friendly homes, using organic gardening methods, and incorporating community recycling and composting.   This type of housing began in Denmark in the late 1960's and spread to North America in the late 1980's. There are now more than a hundred cohousing communities completed or in development across the United States and Canada.</p>
