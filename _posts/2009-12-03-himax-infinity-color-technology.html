<p>Himax's Infinity Color Technology (ICT) is an image processing technology that saves power for LCD TVs and LCD monitors. The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=backlight+unit&amp;sa=Search#1363">backlight unit</a> (BLU) of a LCD consumes the most energy and typical solutions have centered around content adaptive backlight control (CABC). CABC does indeed reduce power but also loses gray scales leading to lower quality images. Gray scale lose can be mitigated by using a 10-bit LCD panel but that is an expensive solution. The ICT, unlike CABC, improves image quality as well as reduce power consumption by up to 50%. Himax has initiated design-in processes for LCD panels and LCD monitor manufacturers. Volume production is expected to commence in the first half of 2010. Better images while consuming less energy? That's a win-win.
