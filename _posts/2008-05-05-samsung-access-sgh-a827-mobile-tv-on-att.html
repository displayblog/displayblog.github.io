<p><a href="http://www.mobiledia.com/phones/samsung/access.html">Mobiledia</a>, <a href="http://www.intomobile.com/2008/01/14/samsung-a827-access-to-bring-up-atts-lower-end-mediaflo-tv-lineup.html">IntoMobile</a>, <a href="http://www.phonescoop.com/phones/phone.php?p=1463">Phone Scoop</a>: Samsung's Access (SGH-a827) is the first mobile phone to offer AT&T Mobile TV, which delivers full-length TV content from top networks including CBS Mobile, Comedy Central, ESPN Mobile TV, FOX Mobile, MTV, NBC 2GO, NBC News2Go and Nickelodeon. That is a lot of content and will keep those who love watching TV glued to the a827. Make sure to note your service agreement as charges can pile up quickly. The a827 has a dedicated TV button to show one of its main features. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the design is ho-hum. There is almost nothing special about it. It would have been nice if it was a slider design since when you're watching TV, there is no need for you to have all-the-time access to the numeric keypad.</p>
