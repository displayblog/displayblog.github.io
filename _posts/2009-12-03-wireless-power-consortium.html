<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=rim&amp;sa=Search#1348">RIM</a> just joined 20 other manufacturers in the Wireless Power Consortium. A major goal for the Wireless Power Consortium is to develop a wireless charging standard called Qi. Why? Of course for our convenience! And because it is cool. I say forget about it. Wireless charging is quite inefficient and wastes a lot of energy. Do we want that just so we don't have to mess with wires? I'd take wires over a bigger electricity bill. I'm finding ways to reduce my electricity bill and if that takes a bit of inconvenience, no problem. Besides the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/10/12/ctia-mobile-device-power-standard-micro-usb/">CTIA Wireless Association will be going to a single universal charging cable standard for mobile phones with micro-USB</a>.
