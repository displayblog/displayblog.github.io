<p>I was just over at <a href="http://gizmodo.com/385262/lenovo-parodies-macbook-air-ad-for-x300">Gizmodo</a> browsing through interesting posts and came up to this video. Lenovo has done a very good job of showing a couple of limitations on the MacBook Air and then making sure that viewers see clearly how the X300 is just as thin but superior in some ways. There is one very important feature of the X300 that needs to be mentioned: the pixel format on the 13.3" LED backlit LCD is 1440 x 900, which is quite a bit more than the MacBook Air's 1280 x 800.</p>
