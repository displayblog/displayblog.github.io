<p><a href="http://logictv.com/blog/2008/6/13/Exclusive_Photos_of_Toshiba_s_Hot_New_Qosmio_X305_Gaming_Laptop__901.aspx">LogicTV</a>: The Toshiba Qosmio X305 looks like a super capable gaming machine. The NVIDIA GeForce GTX has 1GB of video RAM. 1GB!!! And this is on a notebook PC. Wow. The 3GHz Intel Core 2 Duo is probably the most powerful CPU to grace a notebook. The 7200RPM 200GB HD is pretty standard for a fast portable unit and so is the maximum RAM capacity of 4GB. Everything about Toshiba's Qosmio X305 focuses on one thing: hard core gaming. Except one thing.</p>

<p>The 17-inch TFT LCD is the right size, but the pixel format? It's just 1680x1050. What was Toshiba thinking. Get almost everything right and then trip over one of the most important component of making the ultimate portable gaming rig. 1680x1050. That's a shame. Toshiba: next time you're planning on making a super duper portable gaming notebook PC, please make a 1920x1200 LCD an absolute requirement.</p>
