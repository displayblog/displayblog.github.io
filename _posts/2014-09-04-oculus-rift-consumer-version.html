<p>Robert Purchese, <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-09-01-oculus-answers-the-big-rift-questions">Eurogamer</a> interviewed Palmer Luckey, original founder of Oculus VR and inventor of the Oculus Rift:</p>
<blockquote><p>DK2 took the resolution from 720p up to 1080p, reduced blur, smear and judder, and added positional/head tracking. But the resolution, although better, isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t good enough. I struggle in Elite: Dangerous targeting enemies because I can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t clearly pick them out against the backdrop of space behind them. Luckey understands the issue and says &acirc;&euro;&oelig;yes&acirc;&euro;, the resolution for the consumer version will change, will increase, although he won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t say to what. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;It is a significant increase,&acirc;&euro; I manage to get him to say.</p>
<p>The refresh rate will rise from 75Hz to 90Hz &acirc;&euro;&oelig;or higher&acirc;&euro;, apparently, and the improved design brings down both the weight and size of the headset. Will it look fairly similar to how it does [now]? &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Depends on what... fairly similar is a very amorphous term!&acirc;&euro; responds Mitchell. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;It will look like a VR headset.&acirc;&euro; But will it be recognisably Oculus Rift? &acirc;&euro;&oelig;<em>I</em> think so,&acirc;&euro; he says.</blockquote></p>
<p>DK2 stands for Development Kit 2. Luckey wants the consumer version of the Oculus Rift to stay in the US$200-400 price range.</p>
