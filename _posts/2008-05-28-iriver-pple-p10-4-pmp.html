<p><a href="http://aving.net/usa/news/default.asp?mode=read&c_num=87746&C_Code=01&SP_Num=0">AVING</a>: The newest portable multimedia player (PMP) from iriver is its P.ple P10. That is an interesting name, to say the least. The P.ple P10 sports a 33GB HDD and is powered by a RMI AU1250 CPU running at 600MHz. The OS is Windows CE. The external design is nice and simple. The UI, from looking at the picture, seems to be a bit complicated by extensively using nested menus. I would have liked a more Apple-esque "menu" system where you simply tap on functions you need without having to dig into menus so much.</p>
<p>The display is a 4" TFT LCD with a pixel format of 800x480, which is quite nice to have and seems to be becoming the standard for wide displays in the 3" to 4" range. I would hope that Apple's next generation iPhone has at least a pixel format of 800x480, in landscape orientation. P.ple P10's 4" LCD features touch capability but it is unlikely that it will support multitouch, which would have been nice.</p>
