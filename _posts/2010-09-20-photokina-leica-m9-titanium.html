<p>Thanks to Photokina there's a lot of digital camera news. Leica announced the M9 Titanium, a limited edition M9. The M9 Titanium replaces everything that was previously regular metal with titanium and a fingerprint-resistant layer. Only 500 copies will be manufactured. Included in the luxurious package is the M9 Titanium, a 35mm Summilux f/1.4 prime lens, lens hood, a newly-designed holster and a new electronic illumination system. The M9 Titanium will be available in November. The price? &#8364;22,000. Just a note: the 2.5-inch TFT LCD on the M9s have a terrible resolution with just 230,000 pixels. The LCD just seems too low class on a camera like the M9 and now the even more classy M9 Titanium. Leica: may I introduce you to some folks at LG Display?</p>
