<p>The U.S. Department of Justice, <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-31/u-s-files-antitrust-complaint-to-block-proposed-at-t-t-mobile-merger.html">Bloomberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>AT&T&acirc;&euro;&trade;s elimination of T-Mobile as an independent, low-priced rival would remove a significant competitive force from the market.</blockquote></p>
<p>Speaking of T-Mobile's low prices, the pre-paid US$100 SIM card that gives you 1000 minutes valid for one year is the best option for minimalists who rarely use a phone.</p>
