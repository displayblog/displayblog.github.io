<p><a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/12/22/samsung-nc20-netbook-leaked-121-inch-screen-big-keyboard-and-gasp-a-via-processor/">Crunchgear</a>: Intel's Atom out. VIA's nano in. At least that's the case for the Samsung NC series netbooks. The NC20, which is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001I45T9O?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=displ0f-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B001I45T9O">NC10</a>'s (link to Amazon.com's product page) big brother, will sport a VIA U225 CPU. The display grows from 10.6" to 12.1" and gets a 1280x800 pixel format.</p>
<p>The NC20 has a 1.3MP webcam but no specifications for the GPU. The other specs such as the 160GB (on the high side for a netbook), 1GB (2GB would have been better) is pretty standard. The 3.3lbs? Light but the larger MacBook Air has a 13.3" LCD and weighs 3lbs. Samsung could have done a bit better and made it weigh less.</p>
<p>Now for the price: $650. Doesn't sound too bad for a 12.1", but we're talking about a VIA CPU not an Intel Core 2 Duo. Knock off another $150.</p>
