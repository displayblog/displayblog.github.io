<blockquote><p>A tipster has sent us the above leaked slide, revealing that there's a new(er) kid on LG's block in the form of the Optimus G Pro. The 5-inch handset comes with an upgraded 1,920 x 1,080 display [...]</blockquote></p>
<p><em>Update 2013.01.21:</em> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/21/3902234/lg-joins-the-5-inch-1080p-party-with-optimus-g-pro">The Verge</a>: The LG Optimus G Pro is a go, and rumors didn't disappoint. The 5-inch 1920x1080 LCD sports a 440-ppi resolution. Unfortunately, gone are the sharp rear edges from the Optimus G, but you do get a physical home button.</p>

<p><em>Update 2013.02.13:</em> <a href="http://www.newswire.co.kr/newsRead.php?no=679199">LG</a> (Korean): The LG Optimus G Pro will be available late February and instead of the rumored 5-inch display it will sport a slightly larger 5.5-inch 1920x1080 LCD. Resolution will not be 440 ppi, but at around 400 ppi it will be significantly higher than the iPhone's 326 ppi. The display features a curved glass the company calls "2.5D Glass". This sounds gimmicky; give me a straight, symmetrical design instead.</p>
<p>LG thinned out the left and right bezels to make the large smartphone easier to hold with one hand. The result on the white version of the Optimus G Pro looks unbalanced, especially with the LCD's sharp corners so close to the overly rounded radius corners.</p>
