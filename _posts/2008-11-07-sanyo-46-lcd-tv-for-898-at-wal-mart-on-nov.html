<p>Wal-Mart will be holding a special in-store sale on Saturday, November 8, 2008. The sale will begin at 8AM and will include a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sanyo">Sanyo</a> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=46">46" LCD TV</a> for just $898. There will be a minimum of 2 per store with a per customer limit of just one. There is also a Compaq CQ50-139WM <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=15.4">15.4" notebook PC</a> that includes 2GB of RAM and a 160GB HD for just $298. There will be a minimum of 10 per store. For gaming buffs out there that have not yet purchased <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sony">Sony</a>'s <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=playstation-3">PlayStation 3</a>, you're in luck: Wal-Mart will have a minimum of 4 per store. The 80GB <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=ps3">PS3</a> will go for $399 and you get a $100 gift card. Sony's <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=psp">PSP</a> is also on sale for just $199 and this is the one with the Ratchet &amp; Clank game. The $199 price includes a $30 gift card. There will be a minimum of 4 per store. So I would recommend getting in line at your nearby Wal-Mart store if you're interested in getting any one of these great deals!</p>
