<p><a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2011/04/20/apple-grabbed-85-percent-tablet-market-share-in-2010/">The Loop</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s iPad garnered 85 percent of the tablet market share in 2010, according to new research released on Wednesday.</p>
<p>ABI Research said that Samsung&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Galaxy Tab came in second place with a distant 8 percent market share. Archos&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Internet Tablet came in with just 2 percent of the market.</p>
<p>Those three companies account for 95 percent of the total tablet market share.</blockquote></p>
<p>These results are not that surprising since Apple rebooted the tablet market with its iPad with no competition in sight for many months. 2011 should be a <em>little</em> different with many more companies, thought late, jumping in with premature tablets both in terms of hardware and software.</p>
