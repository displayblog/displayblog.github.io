<p><img class="size-full wp-image-6010 aligncenter" title="jvc_8k_camcorder_prototype" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/jvc_8k_camcorder_prototype.jpg" alt="jvc_8k_camcorder_prototype" width="500" height="328" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.akihabaranews.com/en/news-18076-JVC%20intros%20a%20new%208%20and%204k%20video%20projector%20and%20a%204k%20compact%20Video%20Camera.html">Akihabara News</a>: 4K or <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=quad+full+hd&amp;sa=Search#1600">Quad Full HD</a>. The next generation in pixels. The pixel format: 3840 x 2160. That's having four 1920 x 1080 in a 2x2 matrix. JVC has announced its 4K prototype camcorder. 3840 x 2160 = 8.29 megapixels. And that's just a single frame. At 60fps the bandwidth is incredible: 1.42 gigabytes per second!*</p>
<p>I don't know what type of image sensors JVC is using but I'm guessing they will be getting quite hot pumping that much data into a storage medium. A 60 minute 4K footage would require a bit over 5 terabytes. I guess Seagate is happy that storage needs in the future will only increase. Exponentially.</p>
<p>The 4K or Quad Full HD content problem is now partly solved: we can at least expect some professionals to start capturing video in this format. For 4K to really get going the industry needs to get this in the hands of the early adopters. How about a Canon 1Ds Mark Mark IV with 4K video capture capability? Just dreaming...</p>
<p>If you want to future proof your LCD TV investment for the long term, and you need to make that decision right now, there is really one thing do: get <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/06/22/westinghouse-digital-d56qx1-56-quad-hd-lcd-at-infocomm-2008/">Westinghouse Digital's D56QX1</a>, a 56" Quad Full HD monitor. You can also choose from a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/01/07/ces-2009-toshiba-56-quad-full-hd-lcd-tv-prototype-with-cell-processor/">Toshiba</a> or an <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/04/02/eizo-radiforce-ls560w-56-quad-full-hd-lcd-monitor/">Eizo</a>. (I'm not sure if the Toshiba is available commercially.) Just when you thought 1080p was it.</p>
<p>* Here's the math: Each pixel has 3 sub-pixels at a minimum of 8 bits. So each pixel is 24bits. 8.29 megapixels&Acirc;&nbsp; x 60/second x 24bits/pixel. 1 kilobyte = 1024 bytes.</p>
