<blockquote><p>If this is the first you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve heard the term, it refers to Windows PCs that resemble the MacBook Air &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; computers that are thin and light, use a flash drive rather than a traditional hard drive and can boot up rather quickly.</blockquote></p>
<p>Call these thin and light notebooks for what they really are: MacBook Air clones. 2011 was the year of the iPad clones. And 2012 will be the year of the MacBook Air clones.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/01/09/intel-75-plus-ultrabooks-coming-in-2012-50-percent-of-them-wil/">Intel says 75 ultrabooks coming our way in 2012</a>.</p>
<p><em>Update 2:</em> <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/140226/marvel-at-the-shamelessness-of-these-macbook-air-knockoffs-at-ces-gallery/">Leander Kahney, Cult of Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Not only do the they rip off the basic design premise &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; lightweight, portable laptops with long battery life &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; they copy the same wedge aluminum casing, wedge shape, chiclet keyboard, large, button-less trackpad, and the selection and placement of ports.</blockquote></p>
<p>Kahney gives example after example of MacBook Air clones announced at CES.</p>
