<p><a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/230428/iphone_5_edgetoedge_screen_confirmed.html#tk.rss_news">PCWorld</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>SpeechTrans TM, an app developer with links to speech recognition firm Nuance, has posted screenshots of an app running on what appears to be an iPhone with an edge-to-edge screen.</blockquote></p>
<p>Grab your iPhone 4. Look closely at how your fingers hang over the display. On an edge-to-edge display that could constitute a touch, a bad user experience design. And the bottom of the display is too close to the Home button resulting in similar unwanted touches on the screen.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> Dr. Raymond Soneira, President of DisplayMate, sent this in:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you magnify the screen shots 3X then it's then easy to see that the supposed iPhone 5 screen shot is a poorly done cut and paste job from the iPhone 4 screen shot - the screen shot pixels on the frame of the iPhone 5 are identical to the screen shot pixels on the iPhone 4 so they were lifted from the iPhone 4 rather than being from an independent screen shot. Plus the iPhone 5 screen cuts into the Home button...</blockquote></p>
<p>Edge-to-edge iPhone 5? A fraud.</p>
