<blockquote><p>My take after spending a bunch of the weekend with the iPad mini: This is <em>the real iPad</em>. With the exception of screen sharpness, everything about it is better than the bigger, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;classic&acirc;&euro;¬ù iPad &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; and screen sharpness won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be a deal breaker for the vast majority of people.</blockquote></p>
<p>I thought Apple was focusing its marketing efforts on screen sharpness: the new 13.3-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2012/06/12/macbook-pro-with-retina-display/">the 15.4-inch version</a>, the iPad (3) and the iPad (4), the iPhone 4/4S and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2012/09/23/iphone-5/">5</a>, and the iPod touch (4th and 5th generations). So with the exception of what I think is Apple's most important focus the iPad mini is the <em>real</em> iPad? Absurd.</p>
<p>By the way the display falls short of sharpness, of course, but in a few other areas as well. Check out Raymond Soneira's "<a href="http://www.displaymate.com/iPad_mini_ShootOut_1.htm">iPad mini Display Technology Shoot-Out</a>" that compares it to the Amazon Kindle Fire HD and the Google Nexus 7. Spoiler alert: The iPad mini doesn't come out ahead.</p>
