<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/23/acer-reveals-4-8-inch-android-smartphone-with-1024x480-screen-re/">Engadget</a>: Acer briefly unveiled an un-named Android smartphone during its New York City press event today. This Android smartphone packs a 4.8-inch display with an ultra-wide 21:9 aspect ratio. The pixel format is 1024x480 for a total of 491,520 pixels. That's just a bit less than the iPhone 4's 614,400 pixels, but the unique 21:9 aspect ratio is intriguing.</p>
<p>21:9 isn't new. Philips came out with a TV sporting that aspect ratio for film buffs. Film as well as most movies are wider than 16:9. If you want to watch movies without bars on top and bottom a 21:9 display helps. My guess is that Acer will push this phone toward folks that really enjoy watching movies on their phones. It's a bold and creative move.</p>
<p>Other specs include: dual-cameras (8/2), 720p video capture, six-axis gyroscope, full metal body, Bluetooth 3.0, WiFi N, 1GHz Snapdragon, HDMI out.</p>
