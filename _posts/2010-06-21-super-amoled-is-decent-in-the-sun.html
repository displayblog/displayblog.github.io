<p><a href="http://techblog.gr/techtv/samsung-galaxy-s-vs-htc-desire-vs-sony-ericsson-xperia-x10-super-amoled-vs-amoled-vs-lcd-6854/">Techblog</a> took a Super AMOLED equipped Samsung Galaxy S (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/17/samsung-galaxy-s-with-super-amoled/">Samsung Galaxy S with Super AMOLED</a></em>), a regular AMOLED sporting HTC Desire and Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 that uses a TFT LCD out in the sun. OLED display technology has many great features but one of the things it isn't good at is visibility in direct sunlight. The result of the test: In dead last was the HTC Desire. The 3.7-inch AMOLED was barely visible but compared to the other two visibility was significantly lacking. The 4-inch Super AMOLED in the Samsung Galaxy S was quite a bit improved compared to the non-Super. Samsung's claims of more brightness and less reflectivity bore true, but at the end the 4-inch LCD in the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 had the upper hand.</p>
<p>Samsung's Super AMOLED display, like its other AMOLEDs makes use of PenTile Matrix (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/01/20/nexus-one-pentile-matrix-oled-display/">Nexus One PenTile Matrix OLED Display</a></em>) technology, but is 20% brighter, reflects 80% less sunlight and consumes 20% less power than non-Supers (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/17/samsung-galaxy-s-with-super-amoled/">Samsung Galaxy S with Super AMOLED</a></em> for more info). Don't expect this much-improved Super AMOLED display to show up in non-Samsung smartphones because it will be exclusive to Samsung-branded ones for eighteen months.</p>
