<p>BenQ's FP241W is a 24" wide LCD monitor that sports a resolution of 1920 x 1200, much like other 24" offerings from Apple (in the iMac only at the moment), Dell (2407WFP), Samsung, etc. The FP241W has a 6ms response time (grey-to-grey, GTG), a brightness of 500 cd/m2, and a contrast ratio of 1000:1. Connectors include DVI-D, VGA, S-Video, Component, Composite, and HDMI with HDCP. The design is pretty simple with a silver bezel. There are also three USB ports, of which one is on top of the monitor designed for mounting a BenQ webcam--a nice touch. Of course, future LCD monitor designs would most likely have a built-in (upgradeable?) webcam.</p>

<p>Although the rotating features of most LCD monitors are left untouched/unused, I like rotating my Dell 20" wide LCD monitor to a portrait stance for reading documents and surfing the Internet. Almost all pages fit into the long display. I am glad to see BenQ's FP241W have the rotating feature. Of course, your GPU will need to be a capable one because performance will suffer due to the orientation of column and gate driver ICs on a wide monitor. Column drivers are the ones that have much better performance but if you rotate the display, the less capable gate drivers cannot generate the same level of performance. But for regular letter reading and web surfing, portrait mode is capable enough for most.</p>
<p>An interesting trend that I am seeing is the addition of the HDMI connection in LCD monitors. With more and more PCs that will have either built-in or external Blu-Ray and HD-DVD drives, there will be a need for HDMI with HDCP connectivity to please the content guys (and so you can't make digital copies of the movies that you spent a lot of money for). Also when you finally get your hands on a PlayStation 3, you can hook it up to a LCD monitor like BenQ's FP241W via the HDMI connection and rock on at 1920 x 1080!</p>
