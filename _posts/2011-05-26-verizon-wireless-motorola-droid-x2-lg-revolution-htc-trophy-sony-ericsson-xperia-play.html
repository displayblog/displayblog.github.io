<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/26/verizon-bonanza-droid-x2-revolution-trophy-and-xperia-play-h/">Engadget</a>: The Motorola Droid X2 ($200, dual-core Tegra 2, 4.3-inch 960x540 LCD, Android), LG Revolution ($250, 4.3-inch 800x480 LCD, LTE, Android), HTC Trophy ($150, 3.8-inch 800x480 LCD, WP7), and Sony Ericcson Xperia Play (4.0-inch 854x480 LCD, Android) all launched on Verizon Wireless today.</p>
<p>The LG Revolution is the only smartphone that is LTE capable. But the Motorola Droid X2 is the only smartphone that has a dual-core processor. The HTC Trophy isn't much of a trophy: although I like what Microsoft did with the beautiful typography in WP7, the app ecosystem has a ways to go. And the Xperia Play is too Frankensteinian; I'd rather wait for the NGP if I was serious about playing games on the go. If only the Droid X2 rocked LTE, or the LG Revolution had a dual-core processor...</p>
