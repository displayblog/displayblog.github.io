<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/17/motorola-droid-3-official-in-china-under-milestone-3-moniker-pa/">Engadget</a>: A bigger display equals a bigger keyboard equals bigger keys. And that means typing should be easier, too. Of course, there is an upper limit to how big the display can get before the keys are out of reach of your thumbs.</p>
<p>The Motorola Droid 3, or Milestone 3 as it is called in Asia, sports a 4-inch 960x540 LCD. The added pixels should make for watching videos, photos, and playing games a treat. Reading text though could be less-than-ideal on these qHD displays if you have sensitive eyes.</p>
