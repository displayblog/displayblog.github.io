<p>On May 05, 2008, Qualcomm MEMS Technologies, a wholly owned subsidiary of Qualcomm Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM), and Cheng Uei Precision Industry (Foxlink, TSE: 2392), a developer and manufacturer of communications devices, computers and consumer electronics, announced an agreement to build a mirasol fabrication plant to Lungtan's Science Park in Taoyuan, Taiwan. The mirasol fab is expected to be fully operational in 2009. The mirasol fab is a strong step toward volume production of Qualcomm MEMS Technologies' mirasol display that will result in more variety, less time to market, increased manufacturing efficiency, and reduced costs.</p>

<p>Foxlink has created a new business unit to support the effort of producing of mirasol displays. Foxlink currently has 43,000 employees in 15 design manufacturing and sales sites worldwide.</p>
<p>Qualcomm's mirasol displays are based on a reflective technology called interferometric modulation (IMOD) that harness ambient light and require no backlighting. Since the backlight of a display consumes the majority of power, eliminating it greatly reduces overall power consumption for the display. The reflective mirasol display also automatically scales to the surrounding lighting conditions and allows users to see the display content in dark and bright environments.</p>
<p>The Hisense HS-C108 mobile phone is one of the first to incorporate Qualcomm's mirasol display with a pixel format of 126 x 98. The HS-C108 mobile phone is geared for the Chinese market.</p>
