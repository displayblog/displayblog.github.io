<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2010/11/dell-moves-25000-employees-from-blackberry-to-windows-phone-7.ars">Ars Technica</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dell is shifting 25,000 of its employees, or one-quarter of its work force, from Research in Motion's BlackBerry to its own Windows Phone 7-powered Venue Pro. The company is still in discussions with T-Mobile USA, the carrier for the Venue Pro, for buying voice and data in bulk.</blockquote></p>
<p>And that's not all. Microsoft will be doing something similar and transitioning its 89,000 employees to Windows Phone devices.</p>
