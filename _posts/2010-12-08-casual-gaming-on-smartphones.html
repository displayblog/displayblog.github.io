<p><a href="http://www.interpretllc.com/new-media-measure-interpretations.php?rid=51">Interpret</a> &rarr; <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/12/apple-ios-chipping-away-at-ds-psp-for-handheld-gaming-crown.ars">Ars Technica</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to a new report by research firm Interpret, mobile phones are now responsible for about 44 percent of handheld gaming, up 53 percent over the last year. Use of a DS or PSP is down 13 percent over the same time period.</blockquote></p>
<p>The DS has been the dominant handheld gaming device for kids. I don't see these same kids getting smartphones anytime soon, but I do see parents folding under pressure and getting them iPod touches.</p>
<p>The PSP generally attracts hard-core gamers who already have a PlayStation or a Xbox. I don't see smartphones gaining too much on these guys either.</p>
<p>What I do see happening is an explosion of casual gamers who play on the iPhone and Android smartphones. Of course, casual doesn't mean not obsessed: some of these folks are definitely hooked.</p>
<p>The display is the centerpiece of the smartphone today. Graphics <em>is</em> a big part of the gaming experience and a good display will become more important.</p>
