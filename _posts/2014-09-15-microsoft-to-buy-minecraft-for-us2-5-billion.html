<p>It's official. <a href="https://mojang.com/2014/09/yes-were-being-bought-by-microsoft/">Mojang</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As you might already know, Notch is the creator of Minecraft and the majority shareholder at Mojang. He&acirc;&euro;&trade;s decided that he doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t want the responsibility of owning a company of such global significance. Over the past few years he&acirc;&euro;&trade;s made attempts to work on smaller projects, but the pressure of owning Minecraft became too much for him to handle. The only option was to sell Mojang. He&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll continue to do cool stuff though. Don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t worry about that.</p>
<p>There are only a handful of potential buyers with the resources to grow Minecraft on a scale that it deserves. We&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve worked closely with Microsoft since 2012, and have been impressed by their continued dedication to our game and its development. We&acirc;&euro;&trade;re confident that Minecraft will continue to grow in an awesome way.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://notch.net/2014/09/im-leaving-mojang/">Markus Persson</a>, known as Notch and maker of Minecraft, is leaving after Microsoft's acquisition of Mojang is complete:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve become a symbol. I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t want to be a symbol, responsible for something huge that I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t understand, that I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t want to work on, that keeps coming back to me. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m not an entrepreneur. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m not a CEO. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m a nerdy computer programmer who likes to have opinions on Twitter.</p>
<p>As soon as this deal is finalized, I will leave Mojang and go back to doing Ludum Dares and small web experiments.</p>
<p>[..]</p>
<p>I love you. All of you. Thank you for turning Minecraft into what it has become, but there are too many of you, and I can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be responsible for something this big. In one sense, it belongs to Microsoft now. In a much bigger sense, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s belonged to all of you for a long time, and that will never change.</p>
<p>It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not about the money. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s about my sanity.</blockquote></p>
<p>Carl and Jakob are leaving too.</p>
