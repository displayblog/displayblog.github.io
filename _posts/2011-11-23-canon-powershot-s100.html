<blockquote><p>The S95 gets a slight edge in terms of image quality, but the S100&acirc;&euro;&trade;s wider lens, faster performance, and video recording are all solid tweaks on top of the S95.</blockquote></p>
<p>This is a case where specs matter less than expected. The S100 has better specs, but the S95 captures better images. Of course if you own an iPhone 4/4S this is of little relevance.</p>
