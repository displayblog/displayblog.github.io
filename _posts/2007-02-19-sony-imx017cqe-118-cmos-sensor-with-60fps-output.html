<p>Sony's IMX017CQE is a high-speed image sensor that is only 1/1.8" in size and outputs an amazing 60fps with a 6.4 megapixel format. 6.4 megapixels at 60fps equals to 384 megapixels per second! What does this mean? With this single chip, not only can you take 6.4 megapixel images, which would be good enough for all but the professional-level photographers, you can also take really high-definition video. Imagine a small digital camera that takes HD video better than most video camcorders much bigger and more costly. My curiousity is in how the sensor is able to manage heat. With 60fps the chip will be generating quite a bit of heat. And heat is a bad thing that causes all sorts of image/video quality problems. I hope this sensor is for real because I can finally look forward to a single image/video capturing device with really great quality.</p>
