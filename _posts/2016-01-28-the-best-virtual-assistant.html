<p>[ <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/28/technology/personaltech/siri-alexa-and-other-virtual-assistants-put-to-the-test.html">The New York Times</a> ] Brian X. Chen:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple was the strongest at productivity tasks like calendar appointments and email; Google was the best at travel and commute-related tasks. Alexa excelled at music, and Cortana was mediocre across the board.</blockquote></p>
<p>Could someone build a meta virtual assistant who asks all four, decides which is best, and then gives the best answer?</p>
