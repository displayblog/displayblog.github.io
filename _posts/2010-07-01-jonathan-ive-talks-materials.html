In a brief chat with <a href="http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/core77_speaks_with_jonathan_ive_on_the_design_of_the_iphone_4_material_matters_16817.asp">Core77</a>, Jonathan Ive shares his thoughts about materials:</p>
<blockquote><p>A big part of the experience of a physical object has to do with the materials. [At Apple] we experiment with and explore materials, processing them, learning about the inherent properties of the material--and the process of transforming it from raw material to finished product; for example, understanding exactly how the processes of machining it or grinding it affect it. That understanding, that preoccupation with the materials and processes, is [very] essential to the way we work.</blockquote><br />
It is good to know that Apple's Ive will continue to be obsessively preoccupied with materials and processes. I can hope the imperfections found in the iPhone 4 will be ironed out, and soon.
