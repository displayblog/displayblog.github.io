<p>iPad will soon be upon us. The excitement is hard to exaggerate. I did not pre-order but I do plan to visit the local Apple Store to try it out myself. I think I will be thoroughly convinced that I need an iPad but I also need to convince my wife, a task that won't be easy. But Apple has unveiled its <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/guided-tours/">iPad guided tours</a>, a compilation of 11 videos showing how things get done on the game-changing multitouch slab. Maybe these will help.</p>
