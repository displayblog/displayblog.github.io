<p><a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/155224/2010/10/macbookairbto_benchmarks.html?lsrc=top_1">Macworld</a> received maxed out 2010 MacBook Air notebooks and benchmarked them using Speedmark 6.5. The result? According to <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2010/10/27/macbook-air-ultimate-configurations-benchmarked/">MacRumors</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the context of Apple's broader lineup, maxing out the 11-inch MacBook Air brings it within 5% of the current white MacBook on the Speedmark suite, while the top-end 13-inch MacBook Air healthily beats the standard 13-inch MacBook Pro despite the Air's slower processor.</blockquote></p>
<p>If you have a MacBook already and want to blow the socks off of these new MacBook Airs for a fraction of the cost of purchasing them just get a fast SSD.</p>
