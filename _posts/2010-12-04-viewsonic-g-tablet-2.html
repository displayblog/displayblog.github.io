<p><a href="http://www.laptopmag.com/review/tablets/viewsonic-g-tablet.aspx#axzz176ndKxip">Laptop</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The 10.1-inch 1024 x 600 screen on the G Tablet has sharp images but colors seem muted. Viewing angles are solid at 90 degrees to the left or right when holding the device perpendicular to the ground or a table. However, when the slate is resting flat on its back, you must be right on top of it or images wash out completely. [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>The most important component on a tablet like this is the display. And one of the most important features of the display are wide viewing angles.</p>
<blockquote><p>Viewsonic chose to replace the stock Android interface with a Tap 'n Tap software. The UI looks friendly on the surface, but its sluggish performance and lame preloaded apps drag the entire device down.</blockquote></p>
<p>A not-so-great display + a not-so-great UI = a not-so-great experience.</p>
