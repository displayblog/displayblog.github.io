<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/22/sony-pulls-the-plug-on-cassette-walkmans-in-japan-makes-epic-mi/">Engadget</a> is reporting that Sony has now stopped production of cassette Walkmans in Japan. Once inventory in Japanese channels run out there will be no more cassette Walkmans. China-made cassette Walkmans are still a go, to some extent.</p>
<p>I lived with my WM-F102 during my junior high school days back in the mid-80's. I moved around a lot when I was younger so music was my connection to what I had to leave behind. When I left Korea for the second time the WM-F102 and Lee Moon Sae's fourth album, which I recorded off of my LP, kept me connected.</p>
<p>PS: It was difficult finding an appropriate category for this post. Eventually I decided on "Uncategorized".</p>
