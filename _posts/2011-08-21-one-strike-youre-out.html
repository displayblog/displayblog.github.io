<blockquote>
<p>I suppose Apotheker gave the Palm/WebOS guys a chance, and let them get the TouchPad on the market. But apparently their chance was a one-strike-and-you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re-out opportunity to gain traction in the market immediately. But the TouchPad didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t get any traction immediately, so, boom, that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s it, Apotheker is done with them. [...]</p><br />

<p>I get the feeling the Palm/webOS guys wanted more time to fine-tune the TouchPad. But Apotheker, the guy who stated with much bravado that <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/07/12/we-will-not-release-a-product-that-isnt-perfect/">HP wouldn't release a product that isn't perfect</a>, pushed it out anyway knowing it wasn't ready. He wanted webOS to strike out. Which makes sense for an ex-SAP CEO focused on enterprise software and consulting.</p></p>
