<p>Gray Powell will probably go down in history as the person who lost the yet-unannounced iPhone HD (also known as iPhone 4G), which was picked up by Gizmodo and then shared to the world. Poor fellow. I hope he doesn't lose his job at Apple for this mistake. On a side note it seems he takes really good pictures with his iPhone: check out his <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/graypowell">Flickr photos</a>. And if you're curious, read the entire story of how Powell lost an iPhone HD prototype at <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5520438/how-apple-lost-the-next-iphone">Gizmodo</a>.</p>
