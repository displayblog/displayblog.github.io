This was probably obvious to almost all but just to make sure FaceTime on the iPhone 4 (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/07/iphone-4/">iPhone 4</a></em>) doesn't eat cellular minutes. Not surprising since FaceTime only works via WiFi. A regular voice call needs to be initiated first but as soon as you punch the FaceTime button and get connected the cellular portion disconnects. Nice.
