<p>Maj. Leandro Pavani Agostini, chief of military police of Sao Paolo, Brazil <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.aolnews.com/2011/04/13/brazilian-police-debut-robocop-glasses-ahead-of-world-cup/">AolNews.</a> regarding Robocop glasses:</p>
<blockquote><p>It's something discreet because you do not question the person or ask for documents. The computer does it. To the naked eye, two people may appear identical, but with 46,000 points compared, the data will not be beaten.</blockquote></p>
<p>These Robocop glasses can scan 400 faces up to 50 yards away every second.</p>
