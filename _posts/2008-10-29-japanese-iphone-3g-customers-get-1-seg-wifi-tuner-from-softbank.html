  customers will get a treat: a little gadget that receives the <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1-seg\">1-Seg</a>
  mobile terrestrial digital audio/video and data broadcasting service and sends
  it out in WiFi signals. The 1-Seg gadget also works as a battery extender when connected

<p style="text-align: left;">1-Seg broadcasts use <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=h.264">H.264</a> video with AAC+SBR audio encapsulated in a MPEG2 Transport Stream at a bit-rate of 416kbps. The iPhone is more than capable of decoding and displaying H.264 video and AAC audio and its WiFi will easily eat up 416kbps. 1-Seg video has a pixel format of just 320 x 240. Hopefully the video will look much better than what we see via YouTube.</p></p>
