<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=samsung">Samsung</a>'s LN52A750 is a beautifully designed <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=52"-lcd-tv">52" LCD TV</a>. It sports the Touch of Color theme. You can barely tell from the picture but it has a touch of red in the black chassis. The LN52A750 features a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a> pixel format so <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1080p">1080p</a> HD content is fed and displayed without any scaling. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=720p">720p</a> HD content will be scaled up but will experience a slight decline in quality. The 52" LCD TV has a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=120hz">120Hz</a> frequency (double from the normal 60Hz) and that gets rid of almost all motion blur. Love watching sports? The LN52A750 won't disappoint. A response time of 4ms is plenty fast while the viewing angles are excellent at 178/178. This 7 Series LCD TV comes with four HDMI connections: a must if you watch a lot of TV, movies, and play a lot of games.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001418WF4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=displ0f-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B001418WF4">There are 188 customer reviews at Amazon.com and 158 of them gave the LN52A750 a 5 out of 5 star rating</a>.&Acirc;&nbsp;Some negatives were the glass covering that reflected back some light. I would recommend turning off all lights when watching a movie on this beautiful LCD TV but if you have to have some lights turned on, make sure they are not positioned near you: on top, beside or behind the TV would be better. Not so good SD content: this is not surprising. I would stick to a tube TV for SD viewing if that is an option. Some of the positives were invisible touch sensitive controls, computer connection to HDMI easy and without lag, PS3 Blu-ray movies look awesome, etc. It is very important to feed good quality HD video into a TV like the LN52A750.</p>
