<p>Vlad Savov, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/19/4003728/htc-one-launch-announcement">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>First up, the 4.7-inch LCD display is truly a worthy successor to the One X in being bright, crisp, and beautiful, no matter what angle you look at it from. It's optically bonded and comes with a full 1080p resolution, giving it the pixel density (468ppi) crown [..]</blockquote></p>
<p>The HTC One, with a 4.7-inch Super LCD 3, features the smallest 1920x1080 display and hence the highest resolution of 468 ppi. Add stereo speakers to the mix and the HTC One looks to be great for multimedia playback.</p>
<p>Combined with the state-of-the-art display is what seems a remarkable camera: UltraPixels that work like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foveon_X3_sensor">Foveon X3</a> and a multi-axis optical image stabilization (OIS) based on the built-in gyroscope for both the front and rear cameras. Myriam Joire, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/02/19/htc-one-hands-on-design-and-hardware/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Basically you're looking at a 1/3-inch 4 megapixel BSI sensor with large 2&Acirc;&micro;m pixels capable of gathering 330% more light than the 1.1&Acirc;&micro;m pixels usually found in phones. This sensor is mated with a 28mm f/2.0 autofocus lens which is slightly recessed for protection and equipped with optical image stabilization (OIS), just like Nokia's Lumia 920.</blockquote></p>
<p>HTC got off the ridiculous megapixel bandwagon that's been hoodwinking consumers into thinking more is better. The HTC One sports less, but larger pixels that take in more light: A simple solution to a vexing problem of low-light photography.</p>
<p><em>Update 2013.03.11:</em> Unlike <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2013/02/27/the-sony-of-old-xperia-z/">the Xperia Z with terrible viewing angles</a>, which is quite surprising for Sony's top-of-the-line smartphone, there is nothing to complain about the display in the HTC One. An additional confirmation from David Pierce at <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/11/4086390/htc-one-review">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Its 4.7-inch, 1920 x 1080 display (that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s 468 ppi) is the sharpest I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve ever seen. [...] the screen is tack-sharp, colors are fantastic, blacks are impressively deep, and it looks great from any angle.</blockquote></p>
