The most unique feature about the XL2E series is that it can support video display of 1920 x 1080/24p or 1280 x 720/24p input. Twenty four frames per second that is displayed progressively is simply 24p and is the worldwide standard for how film is captured and displayed. Because digital displays such as LCD TVs are usually running at 50Hz (European standard) and 60Hz (US standard), to display 24p content there needs to be processing step called 3:2 Pull Down. Well, that is not necessary for Sharp's XL2E series AQUOS LCD TVs as they can display 24p. Quite nice. The other notable features are 100Hz (solves motion blur to a large extent) and 1080p (future proof, though current content will not look very good without good scaling capability).</p>
