<p><a href="http://www.marco.org/2010/07/04/great-since-day-one">Marco Arment</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I never make technology-buying decisions based on future promises, rumors, or potential. I let other people be the bleeding-edge extremely early adopters, and I stick with what I know will work and stay out of my way. I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t buy things that are &acirc;&euro;&oelig;getting better&acirc;&euro;¬ù, because they usually don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t. Whatever caused them to be lacking in their current release will usually prevent them from being great in future releases.</blockquote></p>
