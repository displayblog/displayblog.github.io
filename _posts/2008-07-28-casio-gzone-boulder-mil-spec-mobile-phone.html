<p><a href="http://www.phonenews.com/first-verizon-casio-c711-boulder-images-surface-3637/">PhoneNews</a>: For those that rely on gadgets to be durable, and I mean really durable, rather than pretty, Casio has something that might interest you. Casio has introduced its G'zOne Boulder mobile phone that is Mil-Spec compliant and eschews shock, dust and water. You'll need to be on a CDMA network for the Boulder to work with EV-DO Rev. A capability. The one question that I have is regarding the durability of the Boulder is the 2.0" TFT LCD main display and the 1.2" external display. Are these LCDs ruggedized too? I sure hope so since the LCD seems to be the weakest part of the Boulder.</p>

<p>I don't know if it is due to the ruggedness, or if the Boulder has a wimpy battery, but talk time is limited to 3 1/2 hours while standby is limited to just over 2 1/2 days. The Boulder can be used as a flashlight, an electronic compass and via Verizon's VZ Navigator it can be your portable GPS. The bottomline: you've got needs for a ruggedized mobile phone, Casio's Boulder is a strong contender.</p>
