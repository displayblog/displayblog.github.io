<p>Andy Rubin as quoted in <a href="http://thisismynext.com/2011/10/19/andy-rubin-i-apps-specific-tablets/">This is my next</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don't think there should be apps specific to a tablet. If someone makes an ICS app it's going to run on phones and it's going to run on tablets.</blockquote></p>
<p>This strategy works as long as there are little differences between ICS phones and tablets.</p>
