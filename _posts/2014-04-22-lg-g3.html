<p><a href="http://www.stuff.tv/g3/lg-confirms-g3-will-have-2k-qhd-screen/news">Stuff</a>: The LG G3 will sport a 5.5-inch LCD with a pixel format of 2560x1440 or in display industry jargon Quad HD or QHD, for a resolution of 534 ppi. The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/04/21/5-5-inch-iphone-6/">5.5-inch iPhone 6 with 1920x1080 pixels</a>, if true, will look outdated as soon as it comes out.</p>
<p>Some might wonder what the point of a 534 ppi display is if we can't even see the difference. Well, there is research out there that suggests a much higher threshold: roughly 600 ppi. If the LG G3 comes with a great camera and the battery lasts for a day, I will be tempted.</p>

<p>LG sent invitations &mdash; set in what looks like dark brushed aluminum with a quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;To be simple is to be Great&acirc;&euro;¬ù &mdash; for a May 27 (San Francisco, New York, London) and May 28 (Seoul, Singapore, Instanbul) event.</p>
