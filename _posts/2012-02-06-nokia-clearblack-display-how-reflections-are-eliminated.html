<p><a href="http://conversations.nokia.com/2012/02/02/clear-black-and-super-bright">Ian Delaney, Nokia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&acirc;&euro;&trade;s both a linear polariser and retardation layers between the surface of your phone and the display. When light hits your screen, this is what happens:</p></p>
<ol>
<li>It hits the linear polariser, this vertically polarises the light. (Polarising means &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; roughly &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; aligning the wave vibration in a particular direction).</li>
<li>Then it hits the circular polariser retardation layer. This converts the light again, making it right-circularly polarised.</li>
<li>Then it hits the screen and bounces off it, switching the rotation of the light to leftist.</li>
<li>It goes back through the retardation layer. When this happens, the light becomes horizontally polarised.</li>
<li>Finally, it hits the linear polariser, since the light is horizontally polarised at this point it can be blocked entirely by this optical solution.</li><br />
</ol></p>
<p>So why doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t the light from your phone&acirc;&euro;&trade;s display get blocked? Because it only goes through the second half of this journey so the light is unpolarised when it hits the final filter and goes through.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>Ingenius.</p>
