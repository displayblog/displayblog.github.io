<p>Gretchen Dahlkemper-Alfonso <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2011/03/moms-speak-out-against-toxic-mercury.php">TreeHugger</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many of these air pollutants are damaging to the health of my family, and I am particularly concerned with the dangerous amounts of mercury that these coal-fired power plants release into our air and water - and into the bodies of my children.</blockquote></p>
<p>There are currently zero limits on how much life-threatening pollutants such as mercury, arsenic, etc. can be emitted by power plants.</p>
<blockquote><p>Also according to EPA, at least 1 in 12, and as many as one in six women of child-bearing age has enough mercury in her body to put her unborn child at risk.</blockquote></p>
<p>In addition to the air, we should be aware that all the CFL bulbs that we installed because we wanted to save energy and be green include trace amounts of mercury. Each CFL bulb may not contain enough mercury to make a difference but tens of millions will eventually need to be replaced. And some of them will make it into landfills and into our environment. The best bet for lighting? LED bulbs. Though they are expensive, they last much longer than CFLs, and are mercury-free. And consider purchasing LED-backlit LCD monitors as well as TVs to lessen the demand for mercury-containing CCFL backlights.</p>
