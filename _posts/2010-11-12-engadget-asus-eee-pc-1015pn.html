<blockquote><p>If the 1015PN and the 1015PE were put in a police lineup, we'd be able to tell them apart by one thing and one thing only -- the 1015PN's matte display. Yep, the the 10.1-inch, 1024x600-resolution LCD isn't coated with a distracting gloss layer, and its pretty great. We actually happen to think that actually improves the viewablity of the panel at most angles -- we didn't have any issues discerning colors when we tilted the screen back and sharing the bright screen with a friend was no problem.</blockquote></p>
<p>The 10.1-inch on the ASUS Eee PC 1015PN is matte. And it is great.</p>
