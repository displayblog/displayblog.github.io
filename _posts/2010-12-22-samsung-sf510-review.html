<blockquote><p>The glossy 15.6-inch, LED-backlit display's 1366 x 768 resolution is expected in this price range. Overall, colors were bright, blacks deep, and pixels smooth in HD content, making for an enjoyable experience when watching videos or working in Word. We just wish we didn't have to tilt the lid back to keep the image from washing out.</blockquote></p>
<p>For me the display is the most important component on a notebook PC and it seems the Samsung SF510 has two strikes against it: low pixel count and narrow viewing angles. For a large 15.6-inch LCD the pixel format should be 1440x900 or more and viewing angles should be much better.</p>
