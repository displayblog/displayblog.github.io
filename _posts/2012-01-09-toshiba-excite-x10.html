<p><a href="http://www.mobilemag.com/2012/01/09/toshiba-excite-x10-worlds-thinnest-10-inch-android-tablet/">Mobile Magazine</a>: Toshiba claims its Excite X10, a 10-inch Honeycomb tablet sporting a magnesium back, is the world's lightest and thinnest: 7.7 mm thick and 1.2 pounds. Woopty-doo. Thin and light are important features, but the most important is the overall performance of the multitouch display. One display spec that is now fast becoming a requirement for high-end tablets is 1920x1200. Toshiba is already behind the curve with a measly 1280x800.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> Jarred Walton, Vivek Gowri, <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/5414/toshiba-demos-excite-101-and-concept-tablet-designs">AnandTech</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Spec-wise, the Excite has a 10.1" 1280x800 display with an IPS panel and Gorilla Glass covering the screen (fixing our only two complaints with the Thrive's otherwise excellent display panel).</blockquote></p>
<p>1280x800 = not fixed. Not excited.</p>
