<p>Lenovo CEO Yuanquing Yang, <em>via</em> <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20110822/lenovo-apple-cant-dominate-tablet-market-for-ever/">AllThingsD</a>:</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will be one of the strongest of the players in this area.</p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>Yang is referring to the tablet area.</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple only covers the top tier. With a $500 price you cannot go to the small cities, townships, low salary class, low income class. &acirc;&euro;&brvbar; Apple is very strong, but when IBM created the PC market there was just IBM; if you look at the PC industry now it is very diversified. I believe that will happen in tablets as well.</p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>So Lenovo will build really affordable tablets, way cheaper than US$500, and target low-income folks, who really need and want tablets. And by strongest, I'm guessing Yang intends to <em>win</em> with the largest market share based on unit shipments. That reminds of HP and Dell: both companies think unit market share is the most important performance metric. It certainly is important, but <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/08/20/sustainable-businesses-are-built-on-profit/">sustainable businesses are built on profit</a>.</p></p>
