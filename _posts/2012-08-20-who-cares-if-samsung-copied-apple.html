<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2012/08/20/hbr-who-cares-if-samsung-copied-apple/">9to5 Mac</a>. James Allworth, Harvard Business Review:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now, if you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re with me so far, then I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t think it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a leap to suggest that having these companies duke it out in court over &acirc;&euro;&oelig;who might have copied who&acirc;&euro;¬ù is counterproductive.

Because copying requires significantly less resources the copying company can charge much less for something that is essentially the same. This can't be good for real innovators and real innovators are the ones who care if Samsung copied Apple.</p>
