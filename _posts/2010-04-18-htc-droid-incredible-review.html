<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/19/droid-incredible-review/">Engadget</a>'s Joshua Topolsky:</p>
<blockquote><p>... the Droid Incredible is the best Android device that you can purchase in America right now. It's better than the Droid, better than the Nexus One, and certainly beats the pants off of any previous generation handsets like the Eris, myTouch, or Cliq.</blockquote></p>
