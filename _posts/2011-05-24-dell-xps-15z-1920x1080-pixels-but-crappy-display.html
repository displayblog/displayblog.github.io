<blockquote><p>...and it looks even better when you lift the lid to find this optional 300-nit 1920 x 1080 screen. Yes, while Apple fans still have to settle for a 1680 x 1050 pixel picture in a 15-inch chassis, an extra $150 $100 buys the XPS 15z a full 1080p display, allowing for high-res movies, games, and wonderfully roomy split-screen multitasking. It's a pretty bright, beautiful picture on this particular screen, too, and though the contrast isn't quite as high as we'd like, Dell's software will automatically adjust the backlight to give you the best out of your blacks and whites. It's also quite glossy, unfortunately, and viewing angles are pretty terrible here, as the picture becomes far less vibrant if you shift your head even slightly to the left or right.</blockquote></p>
<p>Why would Dell use a crappy LCD on what I would consider the company's halo thin and light notebook PC? Large shifts in brightness, color, and contrast at wide viewing angles are just not acceptable. The extra pixels (1920x1080) compared to the MacBook Pro (1680x1050) are welcome, but those pixels are crappy pixels.</p>
