<p><a href="http://www.hankyung.com/news/app/newsview.php?aid=2011090814661&sid=010401&nid=000&ltype=1">Hankyung.com</a>: The Mobile Communications arm of LG Electronics is undergoing a major reorganization. LGE is drastically reducing overseas procurement and marketing personnel as the company continues to experience losses. About 20-30% of dispatched employees have been ordered to return to Korea. LGE Vice Chairman BJ Koo is reportedly behind the reorganization to shift LGE from a focus on marketing to technology and quality.</p>
