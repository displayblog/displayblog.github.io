<p><a href="http://dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=4031">DailyTech</a>: I really like the iPods. But recently they have been annoying me. The annoyance comes from the need to use iTunes. Personally, I don't buy that many songs from iTunes. I usually rip my CDs at the highest bit-rate to preserve audio quality. I wouldn't pay 99 cents for a song encoded with only 128-bits. I'd rather purchase a $11.99 CD that I can get to even if my computer decides to crash. So, I've been looking around to see if there is anything else. What am I looking for? I am looking for a MP3 player where I can simply drop MP3 files into from my Windows machine and start listening to music. I don't even understand how iTunes organizes my music, so in my most recent setting I am making sure that it <i>doesn't</i> organize my tunes. I'll do that myself, thank you. So back to the worthy competitor...</p>
<p>Sansa has introduced the c200 series. The c240 is the 1GB version with a $80 price tag and the 2GB version, the c250, will go for $100. These are really great prices! They both play music and displays photos, but no video playback. But the iPod nano, which is the c200 series' main target doesn't play with video either. I'm still not quite getting the trend toward watching videos on really small screens. Why do you punish yourself like that?</p>
<p>Another feature that the c200 series has that the nano doesn't is memory expansion. Both c240 and c250 players rock a microSD slot for more. The display, though, is only a 1.4" LCD, kind of smallish. Other goodies are: FM tuner/recorder, voice recorder, replaceable battery (very nice, where can I get that super-high-capacity battery that's not made in China so I can rock on for 150 hours...) that lasts 15 hours, MP3, WMA and protected WMA audio playback.</p>
