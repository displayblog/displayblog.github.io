<p>The sucessor to Samsung&acirc;&euro;&trade;s original &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Card Phone&acirc;&euro; the SGH-P300, the SGH-P310 has an improved keypad design incorporating touch-sensors. Touch-based navigation has been recently popularized by LG Electronics&acirc;&euro;&trade; (LGE) Chocolate mobile phone. When I read &acirc;&euro;&oelig;improved keypad&acirc;&euro; I automatically thought the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;0&acirc;&euro;&sup3; key was now in the right position, but no luck there. The &acirc;&euro;&oelig;0&acirc;&euro;&sup3; key is still off to the right of the other 1-9 keys, making the SGH-P310 just shy of perfect as a card &acirc;&euro;&oelig;phone&acirc;&euro;. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m sure I can get used to it though.</p>

<p>The SGH-P310 mobile phone runs on GSM networks (900, 1800, 1900) and has a depth of only 8.5mm, a 1.9&acirc;&euro;&sup3; LCD display with 320 x 240 resolution (which is extremely high for such a small display!), a 2 megapixel camera, a microSD slot and other features such as Bluetooth.</p>

<p>The case is very fashionable with what looks like clips that secures the SGH-P310 from the side. I for one would be very interested in having the option of purchasing one of these in the US.</p>
