<p><a href="http://www.am.necel.com/display/">NEC</a>: On January 2, 2008 NEC Electronics America, Inc. introduced two new 21.3" TFT LCD modules intended for medical imaging applications. These two modules are the first to incorporate NEC LCD Technologies&acirc;&euro;&trade; ultra-advanced, super-fine TFT (UA-SFT) display technology in a 21.3" LCD. The UA-SFT technology improves light transmittance by 20% allowing for brighter displays with the same backlight. In addition, the 21.3" medical panels use a high-intensity direct-backlight system for improved brightness. Samples are available now and pricing can be acquired via <a href="http://www.am.necel.com/sales">NEC Electronics America</a>.</p>
<p>The 1600x1200 pixel format does not seem to be high-density enough for x-ray or MRI applications that require extreme fine detail. The 2048 x 1536, however, should be quite a bit more adequate. When little spots can mean the difference in the health industry, I would hope that there are absolutely zero pixel and sub-pixel defects on 100% of these panels.</p>
