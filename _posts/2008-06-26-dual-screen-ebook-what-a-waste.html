<p>How many of you read a book two pages at a time? I'm sure some of you do, but the majority folks that actually read books read them one page at a time. Whether it is a book, the newspaper, a magazine, etc. we read one page at a time. So what is the big deal with a dual-screen ebook? I'll tell you what the big deal is.</p>

<p>The big deal is that you're wasting an entire screen because it is just sitting there displaying information that you're not reading. You're eyes are focused on the other page. One of the most important features of a portable device is battery life. With this dual-screen ebook, battery life is wasted.</p>

<p>I'm afraid to say that those folks over at the University of Maryland and UC Berkeley just wasted their time developing something that is almost completely useless. Not only that, if this ever become commercialized, you'll be paying about twice as much as you would for something you wouldn't use. I say, "Go back to the drawing board and learn about how human beings read."</p>
