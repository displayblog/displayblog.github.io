<blockquote><p>iPhone 4 in a luxurious case made of 200-year-old African Blackwood. It is a rare, exclusive material of incredible strength and durability. Ornament of the case &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; branded Apple made of 18-karat gold on the back panel. Case is produced from 200-year-old African Blackwood. Model is notable for elegance and noble reticence.</blockquote></p>
<p>US$4500. The option to choose the Apple logo material would be welcome. Gold doesn't go well with black or stainless steel; platinum does.</p>
