<p><a href="http://google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.famitsu.com%2Fgame%2Fnews%2F1217510_1124.html&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;sl=ja&amp;tl=en">Famitsu</a> <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/08/22/psp-3000-screen-head-to-head-with-the-psp-2000-oh-thats-what/">Engadget</a>: The PSP-2000 is on top and the PSP-3000 is on the bottom. There are a couple of improvements of the LCD on the PSP-3000 that I can see from this picture. Just look at the black levels (dark areas in the strawberry) and you can easily see the improvements in contrast ratio. And there is very little glare on the PSP-3000 LCD. Very important when you're using the PSP-3000 where there are a lot of light sources.</p>
