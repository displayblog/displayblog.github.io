<blockquote><p>Or maybe because the retina display just seems like the way every screen <em>should be</em> now. And that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s where it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s actually hard to be in Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s position: When your best seems like what&acirc;&euro;&trade;s natural, it can get lost. But yes, I wouldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t trade the retina display for the old one. Reading books/documents is particularly great. I just wish my Macs had it now.</blockquote></p>
