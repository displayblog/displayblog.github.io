<p>Jason Mick, <a href="http://www.dailytech.com/Nokia+Talks+Trash+About+Android+Apple+Wont+Fully+Launch+WP7+Till+2012/article22421.htm">Daily Tech</a>:</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] Most of Mr. Weber's enthusiasm covers base elements of Mango, not his company's phones.  For example he blasts Android and Apple's iOS, saying that they are "outdated" in basing their phone on the app grid, rather than interactive widgets like Microsoft's phone.</p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>That's Chris Weber, Nokia Oyj. President and head of North American operations.</p></p>
