<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=shuttle">Shuttle</a>'s Fantasy (or Illusion?) mini PC was showcased during <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=computex+2008">Computex 2008</a>. The unique thing about the Shuttle Fantasy is that it looks like a shopping bag--a very nice one made out of some plastic and aluminum parts. I hope wherever you take the Fantasy you have access to a monitor and a keyboard at the least. It would have been better if this was a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=notebook-pc">notebook PC</a> instead.</p>
