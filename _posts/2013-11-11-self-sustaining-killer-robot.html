<p><a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn6366-selfsustaining-killer-robot-creates-a-stink.html">New Scientist</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>To survive without human help, a robot needs to be able to generate its own energy. So Chris Melhuish and his team of robotics experts at the University of the West of England in Bristol are developing a robot that catches flies and digests them in a special reactor cell that generates electricity.</blockquote></p>
<p>Less flies. I could live with that. But what would be terrific is if these self-sustaining robots caught mosquitos instead.</p>
