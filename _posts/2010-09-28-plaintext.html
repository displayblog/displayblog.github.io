<p>PlainText a plain, minimalist text editor for the iPad from the makers of WriteRoom, Hog Bay Software. <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/09/plaintext-ipad-text-editor-from-the-makers-of-writeroom/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+GearFactor+%28Blog+-+Gadget+Lab+%28Gear+Factor%29%29">Wired</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>PlainText has two tricks. It has folders, which apps like Elements don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t support, and it looks gorgeous. The developer, Jesse Grosjean, has clearly spent a lot of time polishing the UI. From the wide margins to the minimalist black-on-gray interface, it looks classy, and makes you want to write. Navigating is easy once you have learned a few tricks: you rename a document by opening it and editing the name in the title bar, for example, and swipe-to-delete files and folders as you&acirc;&euro;&trade;d expect.</blockquote></p>
