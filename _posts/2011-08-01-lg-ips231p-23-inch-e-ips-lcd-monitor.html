<p><a href="http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/reviews/lg_ips231p.htm">Simon Baker</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>However, what the IPS231P does do, it does well enough. Colour accuracy, black depth and contrast ratio were all very good and even the out of the box settings were decent enough. Viewing angles were wide, uniformity was decent and responsiveness was ok. Again, a good screen generally all round thanks to its e-IPS panel technology, but there's nothing which grabs you really here. The input lag was very low which was good, but then if you are looking at a gaming screen then you would probably want something with a better response time.</blockquote></p>
<p>The LG IPS231P sports a response time of 5 ms gray-to-gray (GTG).</p>
