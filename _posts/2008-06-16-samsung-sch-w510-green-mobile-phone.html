<p><a href="http://www.akihabaranews.com/en/news_details.php?id=16221">Akihabara News</a>: The Samsung W510 is the first mobile phone with bio-plastic that is made from natural material extracted from corn. There goes corn prices again. The W510 sports a 2.1" TFT LCD with a 240 x 320 pixel format.</p>
<p>In the process of manufacturing the W510, heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury, Cadmium were not used. A water-soluble coating was used. Does that mean you can dispose of the W510 simply by dropping it in the toilet? That would be interesting.</p>
<p>All accessories do not contain Brominated Flame Retardants (BFRs) or PVC. That means: don't play around with the W510 near fires. The cool thing about the charger is that when it is fully charged, it sounds an alarm for you to unplug it. What should have happened is that when fully charged, the charger should automatically just stop charging. The W510 meets Energy Star requirements.</p>
