<p>2006.09.29: LPL's 1.3mm-thick LCD targeted for mobile phones is about 32% slimmer than typical LCD panels that are between 1.9mm - 2.9mm thick. <a href="http://neasia.nikkeibp.com/topstory/005278">Nikkei Electronics Asia</a> is reporting that the 1.3mm thickness is thinner than OLEDs, which have a typical thickness of 1.5mm - 1.8mm. LPL's thin LCD uses a LED-based backlight with up to 400 cd/m2 in brightness, which is much brighter than the typical 200-300 cd/m2. LPL's structural modification technology is incorporated into this super-slim LCD that provides greater durability without the need for a stainless steel plate that protects the internal components of an LCD.</p>

<p>Imagine a mobile phone that is about 1/4 slimmer than a Motorola RAZR with a LCD that is much brighter!</p>
