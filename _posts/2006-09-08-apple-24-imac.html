<p>Strange. Now they have a 23" Cinema HD LCD monitor and a 24" iMac. Does this mean Apple will introduce a 24" Cinema HD LCD monitor in the near future? Most likely. It is always less costly to source the same panel with higher quantities. The 24" iMac sports 178-degree viewing angles and a typical contrast ratio of 700:1.  Brightness is stated at 400 cd/m2. None of these specifications are breathtaking and are pretty standard. RAM can be expanded to 3GB but only using two SODIMM slots. I guess there are 1.5GB SODIMMs out there. A 250GB SATA drive that spins at 7200RPM is standard but a 500GB version is an option. The Superdrive that comes with the 24" iMac hasn't been updated as it only writes DVD+/-R at 8x speed. That's slow. My 1 year-old external DYI DVD burner that I have from Pioneer burns at 16x. Yes, I know, I buy 4x DVD-R blanks (because they are cheap!) and can't even make use of the 16x speed. And since the iMacs are targeted toward mainstream users, the 8x speed should be plenty fast.</p>

<p>Standard graphics is powered by nVidia's GeForce 7300 GT with 128MB, which isn't too shabby, but isn't all that great either. Opt for the GeForce 7600 GT with 256MB and graphics will be much snappier: good for playing 3D games at higher resolutions. Which brings me to my final point: the 23" iMac had 1920 x 1200 resolution and so does the 24". Although Pixels Per Inch (PPI) drops, those liking slightly larger fonts might like the 24" a bit better, though there isn't too much of a difference. Oh, one more thing: the new iMacs (17", 20" and 24") all have Intel's new Core 2 Duo CPUs.</p>
