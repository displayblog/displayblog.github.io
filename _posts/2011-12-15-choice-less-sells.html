<p><a href="http://bigthink.com/ideas/19529">Sheena Iyengar</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What we found was that of the people who stopped when there were 24 different flavors of jam out on display only 3% of them actually bought a jar of jam whereas of the people who stopped when there were 6 different flavors of jam 30% of them actually bought a jar of jam.  So, if you do the math, people were actually 6 times more likely to buy a jar of jam if they had encountered 6 than if they encountered 24, so what we learned from this study was that while people were more attracted to having more options, that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s what sort of got them in the door or got them to think about jam, when it came to choosing time they were actually less likely to make a choice if they had more to choose from than if they had fewer to choose from.</blockquote></p>
<p>Let's connect this to high tech gadgets. Not Android versus iOS, but brand versus brand, say Samsung versus Apple. <a href="http://www.minimallyminimal.com/journal/2011/11/16/coffee-time-market-share-vs-profit.html">Minimally Minimal's Andrew Kim laid out 134 models that Samsung sells in the U.S. as of November 16</a>. One hundred thirty four. When you go to the Apple Store you get three choices: the iPhone 4S, the iPhone 4, and the iPhone 3GS. Three. And then there's just five notebooks, two all-in-ones, two desktops, and one tower.</p>
<p>This dearth of choice is probably one of the reasons why the <a href="http://retailsails.com/2011/08/23/retailsails-exclusive-ranking-u-s-chains-by-retail-sales-per-square-foot/">brick-and-mortar Apple Stores have the highest retail sales per square foot</a>.</p>
