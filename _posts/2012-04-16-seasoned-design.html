<p><a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2012/04/13/augmented-paper/">Matt Gemmell</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Design an experience. Make it as beautiful - and as emotionally resonant - as it can possibly be. Then adorn the core experience and content with only as much functionality as is absolutely necessary. Functionality - and software-based thinking in general - is like seasoning. A little is an enhancement; any more destroys the flavour, subsumes the artistry of the chef, and may well be bad for you.</blockquote></p>
<p>I resonate with this: Functionality as seasoning.</p>
