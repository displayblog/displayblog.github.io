<p><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/microsoft-is-in-the-drivers-seat-for-windows-phone-updates/2592">ZDNet</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Microsoft will push Windows Phone 7 software updates to end users and all Windows Phone 7 devices will be eligible for updates.</blockquote></p>
<p>That makes sense. Carriers push Android updates and with so many different versions of Android and hardware configurations it is a mess. Apple, of course, pushes iOS updates to its iDevices and the process is simple and clean. Microsoft is using the second approach, which I agree that it should.</p>
