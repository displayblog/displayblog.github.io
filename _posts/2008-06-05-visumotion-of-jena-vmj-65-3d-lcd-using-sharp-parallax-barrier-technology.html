<p>VMJ worked with <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sharp">Sharp</a> to develop what is the largest 3D display: a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=65"">65"</a> 3D LCD. This <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=3d">3D</a> LCD is geared for commercial applications for places like airports, retail outlets, etc. and the best thing about VMJ's 3D LCD is that you won't need to wear geeky 3D glasses to view the 3D content. The 3D LCD incorporates Sharp's 3D technology that shoots images through a Parallax barrier that sends two different images to the left and right eye and tricking your brain into thinking it is seeing 3D. There is an optimum 3D viewing distance with a certain range. You'll need to be in that distance range to see the 3D effect. VisuMotion has been active in this area and has 3D LCDs ranging from 8.4" to 47".</p>
