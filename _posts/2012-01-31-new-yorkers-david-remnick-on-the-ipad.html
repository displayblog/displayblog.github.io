<blockquote><p>The iPad on the other hand and its future permutations I think it's an exquisite way to read the magazine. And we now have 200,000 people who are accessing it that way and 50,000 additional subscribers. It's been a good business; it's also beautiful, which is a lot more important to me.</blockquote></p>
