<p><a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/12/02/ibm-cyber-monday-online-sales-up-8-5-ios-numbers-more-than-quadrupled-android/">Emil Protalinski, VentureBeat</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As always in the U.S., iOS beat out Android in mobile shopping this holiday season. iOS users averaged $114.79 per order compared to $96.84 for Android users, a difference of 18.5 percent.</p>
<p>iOS traffic accounted for 28.7 percent of total online traffic, more than double that of Android, which drove 12.2 percent of all online traffic. More importantly, iOS sales accounted for 17.4 percent of total online sales, more than four times that of Android, which drove 4.4 percent of all online sales.</blockquote></p>
<p>I'm going to come at this from a different angle. Most of us are not made of money, but most of us spend more than we should. And most of us have large debts: credit cards and mortgages to name the two largest.</p>
<p>Based on the above findings by IBM, users with iPhones and iPads spend more time shopping and spend more money buying things during Cyber Monday. If your goal is to spend less time on your smartphone and spend less money on your smartphone, a simple trick might be to trade in your iPhone for an Android smartphone.</p>
<p>PS: I've used both and if I were to guess as to one of many reasons why iOS users tend to shop and buy more is because there are more shopping apps that are better &mdash; as in easier on the eyes and easier to shop and buy &mdash; on iOS than on Android.</p>
