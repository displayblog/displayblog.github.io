<p><a href="http://www.mitsubishielectric.co.jp/news/2011/0427-b.html">Mitsubishi</a>: The news here is the combination of 3D and IPS. The Diamondcrysta WIDE RDT233WX-3D is a 23-inch LCD monitor equipped with a LED-backlit IPS (In-Plane Switching) TFT LCD with a 1920x1080 pixel format. The 3D technology employed does not seem to be active shutter but will still require putting on a pair of passive 3D glasses.</p>
<p>Viewing angles are excellent, as expected, at 178/178. Brightness at just 250 nits might be less than ideal for 3D. Static contrast ratio is 1000:1 and response time is 3.8 ms GTG (Gray-To-Gray). The RDT233WX-3D will be available on May 30 in Japan.</p>
