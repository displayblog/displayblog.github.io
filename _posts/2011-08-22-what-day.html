<p>webOS chief Stephen DeWitt in a phone interview with <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20110822/hp-webos-still-coming-to-pcs-and-printers-pre3-launching-in-limited-markets/">Ina Fried</a>:</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the end of the day, webOs is going to be a popular platform on a variety of connected devices.</p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>And which day would that be? Apotheker was clear that webOS hardware by HP would be shutdown. Yet:</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pre3 is being launched in very selective areas. We&acirc;&euro;&trade;re not broadly launching Pre3.</p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>Why is the Pre<sup>3</sup> being launched at all? Is it perfect? US$99 unlocked?</p></p>
