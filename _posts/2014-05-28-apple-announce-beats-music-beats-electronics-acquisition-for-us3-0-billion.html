<blockquote><p>Please join me in welcoming Beats to Apple. I hope you are as excited as I am about this new chapter in our history.</blockquote></p>
<p>I want to be, but I'm not.</p>
<p>I've been looking for a pair of headphones for quite some time. I've been to several stores, tried some, but never thought much of Beats headphones. I've read a lot of reviews, too. I have a large head with sensitive (physical and audial) ears so I prefer soft cans that cover my ears and sounds that are balanced and accurate. I like there to be clean separation among high, mid, and low frequencies. I enjoy many genres (R&B, pop, rock, classical, jazz, alternative, K-POP, etc.) so I'd like a pair of headphones that can handle the variety.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Style over substance,&acirc;&euro;¬ù is what a lot of reviewers conclude about Beats headphones. I'd have to agree. So that's why I'm not excited about the Beats Electronics acquisition.</p>
<p>I'm scratching my head as to why Apple put such a high value on Beats Music, with 250,000 paying subscribers. iTunes Radio has 40 million users. <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/apple-to-buy-beats-1401308971">Tim Cook thinks it's great</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We love the subscription service that they built &mdash; we think it's the first subscription service that really got it right.</blockquote></p>
<p>I'm not so sure I can trust Tim Cook to know the difference. I know I wouldn't know the difference since I've only done two things when it comes to music: download songs from iTunes and stream songs from iTunes Radio. Oh, and I've ripped my CDs and subscribed to iTunes Match, too. Would I pay for a music subscription services on top or in lieu of how I'm listening to music now? I don't think so. (I've tried Pandora but hate the ads. I've also tried Spotify, but it's not much better than iTunes Radio to depend on two streaming services. I like to keep things simple.)</p>
<p>I think $3 billion is a lot of money for these two companies, but I wish you luck Apple.</p>
