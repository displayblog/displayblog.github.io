<p>[digg=http://www.digg.com/hardware/FlyBook_V5] FlyBook V5 was unveiled at CeBIT. The V5 is a ultra-portable notebook PC (or you can simply lump it into the UMPC category) that has a 8.9" wide LCD sporting a pixel format of 1024 x 600. I like this pixel format because most web pages are designed around a width of 1024 since a lot of the monitors before the popularity of 17" and 19" LCD monitors with 1280 x 1024 pixels had, instead, 1024 x 768. Think 15". I dislike scrolling left-right and with 1024 pixels horizontally, surfing the Internet will require only up-down scrolling most of the time.</p>

<p>The V5 weighs only 1.2kg (~2.65 lbs) and is powered by Intel's Core Duo ULV U2400 running at 1.06GHz. RAM can be expanded to 2GB and has an integrated Intel 945GM GPU. Another good thing about the 8.9" LCD is that it is a touch screen that allows you to use either your finger or a stylus. I think the FlyBook V5 might end up being the ultra-portable Internet communicator that we have all been waiting for... at least for those of us that have average to slightly smaller-than-average hands. I don't think the diminutive 80-key keyboard will be all that comfortable to type especially if you have fairly large hands. Of course, you can simply use the V5 as a tablet and write instead. As long as the price is right (<$1000), I will put the V5 very high on my gotta-have-it list.</p>
<p>Other notable features are: 1.3 megapixel swiveling camera, 3.6Mbps UMTS/HSDPA and quad-band EDGE/GPRS/GSM in addition to Bluetooth 2.0 and 802.11a/b/g.
