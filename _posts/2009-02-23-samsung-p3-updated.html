<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/12/17/samsung-yepp-p3-3-pmp/"><strong>Samsung P3 Specifications</strong></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-4148 aligncenter" title="samsung_p3_02" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/samsung_p3_02.jpg" alt="samsung_p3_02" width="470" height="535" /></p></p>
<p>Samsung has updated and extended the capabilities of its P3 portable multimedia player (PMP). The P3 has now the "ability to play native resolution 800 x 600 video" according to <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/02/23/world-gets-updated-samsung-p3-us-still-gets-none/">an Engadget post</a>. I wonder what that's all about since the P3 has a 3" LCD with a pixel format of 480 x 272. Who encodes video in 800 x 600? I can understand 800 x 480 or for viewing on netbooks a pixel format of 1024 x 600. But 800 x 600? Weird.&Acirc;&nbsp;Not weird is the added memo program that lets you ... draw your notes. Pretty nifty I would say. Performance has been improved by 30% according to Samsung. The P3 is a very thin and sexy PMP and with the added improvements should be able to compete with the best of them.</p>
