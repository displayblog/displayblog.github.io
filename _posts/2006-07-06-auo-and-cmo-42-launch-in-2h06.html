<p>AUO's 7th generation fab will become operational in 4Q this year that can cut eight 42" LCD TV panels, compared to only six with its current 6th generation line. The 42" LCD TV panel will have 1920 x 1080 resolution, 1200:1 contrast ratio, 550 nits, and a color gamut of 72% NTSC. CMO will be doing it too. It's new 42" LCD TV panel will have Full HD support (1080p), 1500:1 contrast ratio, 90% NTSC color gamut and will ship it 4Q this year. That makes three 42" LCD TV panel suppliers (including LG.Philips LCD) compared to only one for 40" (S-LCD). Wait, CMO will be making 40" too. But the main problem for the 42" camp is that the TV brands (Philips and LG) are not as strong as Samsung and Sony. Only time will tell who will win, but I might go with LCoS when the thickness becomes as thin as plasma or LCD at the 60" range. Of course, LCoS will be much cheaper too.
