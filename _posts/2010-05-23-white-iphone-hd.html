<p><a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2010/05/21/more-white-next-generation-iphone-parts-surface-as-renderings-gain-publicity/">MacRumors</a>: Or white iPhone 4G. A user Seraphan from an Italian site iSpazio created a beautiful rendering of what a white iPhone HD might look like. I certainly hope the real iPhone HD looks like this rendering. As I have mentioned in previous posts I really dislike the cover glass that is used on iPhones (and iPad, MacBook/Pro, iPod touch) mostly because dust gets trapped between the cover glass and the LCD and there is nothing you can do about it (read <a href="/2010/05/10/gorilla-makes-us-lazy/">Gorilla Makes Us Lazy</a>). Maybe I can also hope for a fingerprint-resistant matte LCD. This render is beautiful.</p>

<p><em>Update 2010.05.23 17:33 PDT:</em> via <a href="http://www.fonearena.com/blog/17524/iphone-4ghd-white-spotted.html">fonearena</a>. Chinese site Apple.pro has a shot of what it claims is the next-generation iPhone in white. I'm not absolutely sure but it looks like the cover glass is there. But I'm digging the white.</p>
