<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dell">Dell</a>'s S2209W is a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=21.5"">21.5"</a> LCD monitor that sports a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a> pixel format, much like LCD TVs. The S2209W therefore has a 16:9 aspect ratio. So Dell is aiming the S2209W to those who might want to use the monitor as a TV to watch 16:9 <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1080p">1080p</a> HD content. But there is one small problem: there is no HDMI connection. And that means that your Xbox 360 (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WNLOXC?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=displ0f-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000WNLOXC">Amazon.com link</a>) or your PlayStation 3 (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WPGIOK?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=displ0f-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000WPGIOK">Amazon.com link</a>) is out of the question. All of the 1080p HD video will need to come from your PC. That is unless you get a HDMI-to-DVI connector, but I'm not sure how well that would work and it simply might be better to get a monitor with a HDMI connector if connecting a game console is a must.</p>
<p>The external design is simple and quite pleasing to the eye. The TN (Twisted Nematic) TFT LCD is relative fast at 5ms, has a fairly decent contrast ratio of 1000:1 and has both DVD-D and VGA connections. The viewing angles is a bit limited at 170/160 but as long as you're looking at the display from right in the middle the S2209W should look just fine. Don't try to mount this and use it in portrait mode as the TN display will look quite bad. A cool feature on the S2209W is the touch-sensitive buttons on the right bezel--a nice 'touch'.</p>
