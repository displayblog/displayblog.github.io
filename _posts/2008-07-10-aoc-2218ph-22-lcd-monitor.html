<p>One is the 12,000:1 <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dynamic-contrast">dynamic contrast</a> ratio. This isn't much anything unless you're watching movies on it. The second special feature is indeed special. 2ms response time will allow you to frag as fast as you humanly can. Overall the design looks very nice, but to compare it to <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=apple">Apple</a>'s Cinema HD displays is, well, not quite an apples to apples comparison. For one Apple's displays look great but they are backed up with high-end <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=ips">IPS</a> LCD panels.</p>
<p>Here's the entire press release from AOC:</p>
<blockquote><p>
