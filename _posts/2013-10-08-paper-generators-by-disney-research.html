<p><a href="http://www.disneyresearch.com/project/paper-generators/">Disney Research</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We present a new energy harvesting technology that generates electrical energy from a user&acirc;&euro;&trade;s interactions with paper-like materials. The energy harvesters are flexible, light, and inexpensive, and they utilize a user&acirc;&euro;&trade;s gestures such as tapping, touching, rubbing and sliding to generate energy. The harvested energy is then used to actuate LEDs, e-paper displays and other devices to create interactive applications for books and other printed media.</blockquote></p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
