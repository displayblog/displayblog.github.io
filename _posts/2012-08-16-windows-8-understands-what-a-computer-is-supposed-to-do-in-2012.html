<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/16/3246185/this-is-my-next-windows-8">David Pierce, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ultimately, that's what I love about Windows 8: without losing any power or capability, it added a ton of the features I love about my phone, from full-screen optimized apps to pretty interfaces to lots of glanceable content. I don't need to spend all my time bouncing between a dozen different apps, because so much information is already surfaced for me.</blockquote></p>
<p>Windows 8 is more productive and fun:</p>
<blockquote><p>I'll be switching because Windows 8 is the first desktop operating system that understands what a computer is supposed to do in 2012, and it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s at once more productive and more fun than any OS I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve used before.</blockquote></p>
