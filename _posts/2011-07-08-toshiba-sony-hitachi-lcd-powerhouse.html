<p>David Hsieh, <a href="http://www.displaysearchblog.com/2011/07/major-japanese-smallmedium-fpd-maker-to-compete-with-taiwan-and-korea/">DisplaySearch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If this were to occur, the merger would create not only a manufacturing powerhouse, but also a technology leader.</blockquote></p>
<p>What each company brings to the table:</p>
<ul>
<li>Toshiba: LTPS (Low Temperature Poly-Silicon), OCB (Optically Compensated Bend), auto-stereoscopic 3D for mobile devices.</li>
<li>Hitachi Displays: IPS (In-Plane Switching), MEMS displays in cooperation with Pixtronix.</li>
<li>Sony: IPS, LTPS, AMOLED.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>The small/medium display space is becoming more important as enthusiasm for TVs have waned while smartphone and tablet sales have been extraordinarily strong. A small/medium display joint venture among Toshiba, Sony, and Hitachi would bring serious competition to the display industry, currently led by Korea-based Samsung and LG Display.</p>
