<blockquote><p>The ShowWX+ uses the same laser illumination, but they&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve upped the lumens to 15. Other, traditionally lit pico projectors are hitting 20, even 30 lumens, but they don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have lasers. The resolution is comparable, at 848&Atilde;&mdash;800.</blockquote></p>
<p>848x800? That sounds weird. Probably meant to say 848x480 (still strange) or something similar. 15 lumens isn't that bright and the fact that the ShowWX+ is using lasers doesn't mean squat. What it does mean is to make sure never to look into it. The US$449 price is on the expensive side. There is one nifty feature though: with a adapter/cable you can plug this little pico-projector straight into an iDevice like your iPhone or iPad.</p>
