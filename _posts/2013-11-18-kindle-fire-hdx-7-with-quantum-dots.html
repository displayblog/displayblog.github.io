<p><a href="http://www.displaymate.com/Tablet_ShootOut_4.htm">More from Raymond Soneira</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>While IGZO has been getting most of the attention, a dark horse called Quantum Dots has emerged as a new and  truly revolutionary super high-tech advancement for LCD displays &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; and it is showing up for the first time in the Kindle Fire HDX 7, which we test here.</p>
<p>Quantum Dots are almost magical because they use Quantum Physics to produce highly saturated primary colors for LCDs that are similar to those produced by OLED displays. They not only significantly increase the size of the Color Gamut by 40-50 percent but also improve the power efficiency by an additional 15-20 percent. Instead of using White LEDs (which have yellow phosphors) that produce a broad light spectrum that makes it hard to efficiently produce saturated colors, Quantum Dots directly convert the light from Blue LEDs into highly saturated primary colors for LCDs.</blockquote></p>
<p>Good call Amazon, specifically Lab126.</p>
