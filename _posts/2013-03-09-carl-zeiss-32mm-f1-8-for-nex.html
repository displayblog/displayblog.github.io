<p>Michael Zhang, <a href="http://www.petapixel.com/2013/03/07/zeiss-glass-coming-to-fujifilm-x-and-sony-nex-cameras/">PetaPixel</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Carl Zeiss&acirc;&euro;&trade; legendary glass is coming to Fuji X and Sony E mount cameras. If you have an X series or NEX mirrorless camera, you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll soon be able to purchase a 12mm f/2.8, a 32mm f/1.8, or a 50mm f/2.8 macro.</blockquote></p>
<p>The lenses look beautiful, but they are pricey: US$1000 to $1400. One niggle: One of the most important features of a NEX is the big image sensor in a compact body compared to DSLRs. What's the point of having a compact body when these fancy lenses are so big? Can't Zeiss and other lens manufacturers make them less bulky?</p>
