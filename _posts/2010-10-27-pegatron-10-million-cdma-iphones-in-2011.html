<blockquote><p>Pegatron Technology internally expects its Apple CDMA iPhone shipments to reach 10 million units in 2011 and the company has recently started to gear up and is installing new equipment as well as hiring about 10,000 new employees at its plant in Shanghai, China, according to sources from component makers.</blockquote></p>
<p>Pegatron also makes MacBooks and the iPad for Apple. I recently upgraded to the iPhone 4 and AT&T sucks where I live. Maybe I should take advantage of the no-questions-asked 30-day return policy...</p>
