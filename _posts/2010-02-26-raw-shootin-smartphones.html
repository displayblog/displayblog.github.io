<p>OmniVision's latest is a 1/4-inch 5MP image sensor that has bigger photosensors, works well in low ambient light environments, and can shoot 720/60p or 1080/30p HD video. It can even capture photos in 10-bit RAW format.&Acirc;&nbsp;Ooh. Mass production for the 1.4-micron OmniBSI backside illuminated OV5647 image sensor is slated for July. And the next iPhone should be announced around June or July of this year. If the next generation iPhone or any other smartphone ends up with this OmniVision image sensor compact digital cameras will be in serious trouble.
