<p><a href="http://www.displaymate.com/iPad_iPhone_ShootOut.htm">Dr. Raymond Soneira</a> takes a close look at the 9.7-inch IPS TFT LCD on the iPad 2:</p>
<blockquote><p>As we show in the Comparison Table below the display on the iPad 2 delivers almost identical performance to the impressive iPhone 4 Retina Display. Although the iPad has a higher pixel resolution than the iPhone 4, the screen is much larger so the number of Pixels Per Inch is only 132 ppi compared to the iPhone 4 Retina Display value of 326 ppi. Lower ppi makes the pixels more apparent, an effect called pixelation. The very high ppi is a major marketing feature for the iPhone 4, but it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s actually something of an overkill (and primarily there for App compatibility) because existing anti-aliasing methods can successfully reduce noticeable pixelation at lower resolutions and ppi.</p>
<p>While the iPad 2 has excellent LCD display hardware, there are two significant shortfalls in the OS display software that Apple could &acirc;&euro;&oelig;easily&acirc;&euro;¬ù fix with a software update that would notably improve the already excellent iPad 2 display performance.</blockquote></p>
<p>The iPad 2 sports an excellent IPS display, but there are two problems with the software though. One is anti-aliasing that negatively impacts sharpness in text and graphics. Dr. Soneira recommends Apple go to sub-pixel anti-aliasing. The second problem is auto brightness that keeps the brightest ambient light sensor value from when it was woken up resulting in display brightness that's too bright and wastes energy.
