<p>Like watching TV? Especially that high def <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1080p">1080p</a> kind? Don't we all. Do you want to save money too? And while you're saving money, do you want to be green and save energy as well? It isn't some future technology that we need to wait for or pay a lot of money for. We don't need to improve the design dramatically to get energy savings. All you need to do is get over the want of ultra-thin TVs and get a rear projection TV. I'll tell you why.</p>
<p>Ultra-thin TVs are a waste, unless you are planning to install them on your wall. Sure, they look really nice because they are really thin. But. If you are not going to install it on your wall, then what good is it being thin? Consider your <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=blu-ray">Blu-ray</a> player. Is your Blu-ray player as thin as your brand new <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a> or <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=plasma-tv">plasma TV</a>? The $500 stand you just bought for that super-thin TV. Is that thin too? Probably not. You need depth to place your Blu-ray player, receiver, XBox 360, etc. So <del datetime="2008-07-06T17:22:23+00:00">spend </del> waste extra money on super-thin when you're not even taking advantage it?</p>
<p>Thin TVs are trying to be less energy consuming. The LCD TV Association has a 'green TV' initiative that encourages brands to incorporate an ambient light sensor to modulate the backlight to save energy up to 30%. Of course, adding sensors, a feedback mechanism, etc. will initially cost a bit more and add complexity.</p>

<p>Going green doesn't necessarily mean going thin. Rear projection TVs are a bit bulkier. True. But what does that bulk get you. Rear projection TVs have always consumed considerably less power. If you want to reduce power consumption and help the environment, seriously consider a rear projection TV. These TVs are going even more extreme toward power conservation by kicking the UHP bulb out and bringing in super-green technology such as <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led">LED</a>. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/05/25/samsung-hl67a750-67-led-dlp-tv/">Samsung's HL67A750</a> is a 67" <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dlp">DLP</a> rear projection unit that looks really good but also has RGB LEDs to make sure the picture's colors pop, all while consuming less energy. The HL67A750 will run you about $2200. Try getting a 60" or larger LCD TV or plasma TV with a RGB <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led-backlight">LED backlight</a> for that price. </p>
<p>Speaking of which... Sony has its <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=70"">70"</a> LCD TV that incorporate its incredible TRILUMINOS RGB LED backlighting technology. The KDL-70XBR3 is 3" larger than Samsung's HL67A750 and is probably several inches thinner. Sony is also planning to introduce an updated version, the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/06/07/sony-kdl-70xbr7-70-lcd-tv/">KDL-70XBR7</a>, more improvements, higher price. The older KDL-70XBR3 will cost you. How does a cool $29,000.00 sound to you? $2,200 versus $29,000. No contest. And, the 70" beast will consume electricity like there is no tomorrow.</p>
<p>Save money. Save energy. Go green. Buy rear projection.</p>
