<p><a href="http://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Deals/Sony-looking-to-sell-PC-business-to-investment-fund">Nikkei Asian Review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sony is in talks to unload its sluggish personal computer operations to investment fund Japan Industrial Partners as it tries to shift focus to smartphones, The Nikkei learned Tuesday.</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple's iOS was born of OS X. OS X was honed on Macs. The two are inseparable: a strong OS X leads to a strong iOS, and vice versa. The symbiotic relationship does not end with code; more iPhone sales means more Mac sales, and the other way around. Focus should not be on a particular product category. Focus should be on people: how they live, how they play, how they work.</p>
