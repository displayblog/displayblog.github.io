<p>Samsung has 5 SlimFit models. Three 27" and two 30". The TX-S3082WH 30" SlimFit CRT comes in at a portly 19.5" thick weighing 128 lbs! The weight hasn't changed much, but the thickness has, from around 60" down to about 20". It is still fairly thick, but if you want the best picture quality around and don't mind the 30" size limitation and don't mind the possibility of having EMI interfering with your visual system (remember your mom always telling you to not to sit too close to the TV?... well, she instinctively knew something), then Samsung's SlimFit CRTs are the best TVs for you.</p>
