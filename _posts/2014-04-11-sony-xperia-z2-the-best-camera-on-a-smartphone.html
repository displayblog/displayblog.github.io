<p><a href="http://www.dxomark.com/Mobiles/Sony-Xperia-Z2-overview-Revised-model-takes-first-place-in-Mobile-rankings">Kevin Carter, DxOMark</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In our industry-standard benchmarking tests, the revised Z2 impresses with its color and detail preservation, both outdoors and in more challenging lighting, and it retains the fast autofocus of the Z1 while improving its precision. Noise levels remain low with none of the objectionable chroma noise found on some rivals; only some fine-grained luminance type noise is noticeable at times.</p>
<p>Although the Z2 is ranked number one overall, it is in fact in joint first place with the Nokia 808 Pureview for stills image quality, ahead of the Apple iPhone 5S, Nokia Lumia 1020 and the Samsung Galaxy S4 in the that category.</p>
<p>While the Xperia Z2 can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t boast the best video score it is still impressive, more so when you consider the 4K capability, coming in 3rd place in our database, just behind its predecessor and the GoPro Hero3 action-camera.</blockquote></p>
<p>DxOMark is just one test, but it <em>is</em> an indicator and the result is pointing to Sony having done some solid work on its Z series smartphone camera subsystems.</p>
