<blockquote><p>If you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re willing to put in the time to really get acquainted with the X10, the reward is huge &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; it takes excellent photos and video, and will get more than a few envious looks while you shoot with it in public.</blockquote></p>
<p>The learning curve seems to be high. In a world of instant gratification, and isn't digital photography all about that?, the time and effort it takes to master the X10 <del>might</del> will be off-putting for many. But I must think the destination, the reward of amazing photographs, will be all the more sweet after a long and arduous journey. US$600.</p>
