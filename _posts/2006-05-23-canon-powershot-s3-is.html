<p>I will focus on the little display of the S3 IS. For an in-depth overview of the camera, I always find <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/CanonS3IS/Default.asp">DPReview</a> to be the best. The S3 IS comes with a 2.0" TFT LCD that flips out and twists with a total number of pixels at 115,000. The size has improved from the S2 IS, but the pixel count stayed the same. The actual pixel format is 521 x 218 that results in a very high density display with 243.22 PPI, but the total number of pixels don't quite reach 115,000, but is actually 113,578. Of course, it's easier, from a sales/marketing standpoint, to simply put down 115,000, so I understand the business aspect of it, but for display folks every pixel counts.</p>
