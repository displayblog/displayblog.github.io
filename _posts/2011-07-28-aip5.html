<blockquote><p>[...] the SKUs are being referred to internally as AIP5, which obviously stands for Apple iPhone 5. This is a level up from the iPhone 4&acirc;&euro;&sup2;s SKU name: AIP4. The interesting part here is that both SKUs are attached to 16 GB and 32 GB capacities.</blockquote></p>
<p>Rumor: South Korea's KT has AIP5-32, AIP5-16, and AIP5-00 in its system. AIP5-00 refers to the unlocked version.</p>
