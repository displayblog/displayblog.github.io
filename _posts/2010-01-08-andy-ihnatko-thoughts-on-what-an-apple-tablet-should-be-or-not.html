<p><a href="http://www.suntimes.com/technology/ihnatko/1980077,ihnatko-apple-tablet-microsoft-010710.article">A great read</a> for those of us who want to know as much as possible about the rumored Apple tablet, which Andy refers to as RAT. Here are the major sub-sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>The RAT will have a "slate" form factor.</li>
<li>The price will be above $500 but below $800.</li>
<li>Like the iPhone, it'll be a closed system.</li>
<li>It'll be SSD based.</li>
<li>A monthly wireless broadband contract will not be required.</li>
<li>No hardware keyboard.</li>
<li>It'll run its own OS (based on OS X) but it'll be part of the iPhone's app ecosystem.</li>
<li>Apple will not sell periodicals and books through the iTunes Store.</li>
<li>The RAT will be as completely unlike the iPod Touch and the MacBook as the iPhone was to the iPod and every other smartphone.</li>
<li>The RAT will be like a pair of glasses. Not a sheet of paper or a computer screen.</li>
<li>But wait just a minute</li>
<li>Then again ...</li><br />
</ul><br />
I hope Andy is wrong about Apple not directly selling periodicals and books through the iTunes Store. I still think Apple should purchase Zinio and integrate it into the iTunes Store and directly sell not only books but magazine &amp; newspaper subscriptions. via <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/01/08/ihnatko">Daring Fireball</a></p>
