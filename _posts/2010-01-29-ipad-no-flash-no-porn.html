<p><a href="http://theflashblog.com/?p=1703">TheFlashBlog</a> <em>via</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/01/29/porno-flash">Daring Fireball</a>: Lee Brimelow posted up a bunch of screen images of the iPad. There are ten images and all of them have one thing in common: a blue square Lego piece with a question, which is the icon when Flash isn't working. Of the ten, I personally use two, of which one is Hulu: my favorite way of watching TV. I guess I won't be watching TV via Hulu on an iPad. But that's not what got me to type up this post. Lee also had a screen image of Flash not working on a porn site. This is what he said responding to a reader's comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>I'm not playing up any porn angle. But it is HUGE part of the web and is almost entirely Flash-based.</blockquote></p>
<p>I don't like porn and I think it is one of many vices that have a materially negative impact on our understanding of what healthy relationships between the two sexes are and should be. So, if what Lee is saying is true, then the absence of Flash on the iPad is a big plus for many of us who want to stay clear of porn on the Internet.</p>
