<blockquote><p>Back in the country, one such generous person is [none] other than Softbank founder and CEO Masayoshi Son, who's recently visited Tamura, one of the cities most affected by the Fukushima nuclear disaster. During that trip, Son announced that Softbank will cover a year's worth of living costs (commute and food) and provide job positions for the 1,200 people to be relocated to Takeo in Saga, the prefecture where Son originated.</blockquote></p>
<p>Masayoshi Son will also pay phone bills for earthquake orphans on other networks.</p>
