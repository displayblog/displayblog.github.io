<strong>Dynamic Off</strong> One quick observation was that these HDTVs "delivered their best picture quality with all of their much-hyped advanced features... turned off." Any function that dynamically processed images were disabled including: dynamic backlight, dynamic contrast, dynamic black, dynamic white, dynamic color. Ugly image artifacts were introduced when these features were used. Also, the specifications that you see are are "actually marketing tools rather than a set of scientifically objective tests and measurements."</p>

<p><strong>Second Tier</strong> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=samsung&amp;sa=Search#1363">Samsung</a>'s performance came below Sony and Panasonic. What made Samsung stand out was its "... Dynamic <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=led+backlight&amp;sa=Search#1363">LED backlighting</a> together with zoned LED <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=local+dimming&amp;sa=Search#1379">Local Dimming</a>." DisplayMate turned off these features that led to intensity scale errors and "ugly halos in scenes with dim content". A great test for these two technologies is Chapter 14 of <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref%255F%3Dnb%255Fss%255F0%255F13%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3D2001%2520a%2520space%2520odyssey%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%26sprefix%3D2001%253A%2520A%2520Space&amp;tag=displ0f-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Listing at Amazon</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=displ0f-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />) that show a trip in hyperspace. Samsung simply showed a black screen, eliminating star fields: not good.</p>
<p><strong>Best</strong> Both <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=panasonic&amp;sa=Search#1348">Panasonic</a> and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=sony&amp;sa=Search#1348">Sony</a> was easy to calibrate to the HDTV Rec. 709 (ITU-R BT.709) standard: primary chromaticities were accurate, a D6500 White Point was established, intensity scales were accurate and so was the 2.2 Gamma. Both performed very well when viewed from the front but Sony didn't quite as well when viewed slightly off angle, when there was dark content, and when there was a lot of motion. The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=50-inch+plasma+tv&amp;sa=Search#1379">50-inch plasma TV</a> from Panasonic was without question the best.</p>
<p><strong>Wide Color Gamut</strong> The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=wide+color+gamut&amp;sa=Search#1363">wider the color gamut</a>, the better the color. Right? Wrong! According to DisplayMate, "... a larger color gamut will simply make all of the screen colors appear more saturated than they ought to appear on a calibrated standard HDTV. Wider color gamuts decrease color accuracy and should be avoided except in specialized imaging applications... it is a pretty useless feature in current HDTVs."</p>
<p><strong>Calibration</strong> "Sony is the only major HDTV manufacturer that seems to be able to deliver a fairly accurate calibration across most of its product lines once you take the units out of their factory default Vivid mode and set them to a Cinema or Custom mode." DisplayMate makes a smart observation for the need for accurate color in HDTVs: consumers can view pictures taken from their digital cameras right on the HDTV. With pictures that they have taken, average consumers will know if the colors are off.</p>
