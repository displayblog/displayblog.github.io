<p><a href="http://www.sanspoint.com/archives/2015/04/29/the-tablet-is-being-squeezed-out/">Richard J. Anderson</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p> The problem is that the tablet as a form factor, is being squeezed from both sides: bigger smartphones that can do all the things a modern tablet can do, and thinner, lighter laptops that can do all the things a modern tablet can do&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and more.</blockquote></p>
<p>Within the Apple world, the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus is the rock, the 12-inch MacBook is the hard place, and the iPad &mdash; both the 7.9-inch iPad mini and the 9.7-inch iPad Air &mdash; is between the two, being squeezed, hard.</p>
