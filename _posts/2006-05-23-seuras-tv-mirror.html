<p><a href="http://www.seura.com/index.html">Seura</a> is based in Green Bay, WI, an interesting place from where some really cool technology is coming from. The company's TV Mirror is a normal mirror when the TV is turned off. But, when the TV is turned on, it appears from nowhere and in the middle of your mirror is video content that's been piped through satellite or cable. According to <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/industries/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=188100477">InformationWeek</a>, sizes start from 24" x 36" to 45" x 36". The actual LCD TV is from Sharp. Prices are also pretty affordable considering how cool this is: $3200.</p>
