<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/01/ok-then/">Ben Brooks</a>. <a href="http://www.isuppli.com/Mobile-and-Wireless-Communications/News/Pages/Lumia-900-Introduction-to-Trigger-Smartphone-Renaissance-for-Nokia-and-Microsoft.aspx">Wayne Lam, IHS iSuppli</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Largely based on Nokia&acirc;&euro;&trade;s strong support, Windows Phone is set to regain the No. 2 rank in the smartphone operating system in 2015. Finnish-based Nokia in 2009 lost its second-place worldwide ranking because of rising competition from Google Inc.&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Android and Apple Inc.&acirc;&euro;&trade;s iOS.</p>
<p>In 2015, however, Windows Phone will account for 16.7 percent of the smartphones shipped, up from less than 2 percent in 2011, according to the IHS iSuppli Mobile & Wireless Communications Service at information and analysis provider IHS (NYSE: IHS). This will allow Windows Phone to slightly surpass Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s iOS to retake the market&acirc;&euro;&trade;s second rank behind Android [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>No one, and that includes all market research firms, knows what will happen in 2015. Their guess is as good as yours.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> <em>via</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/01/22/greatly-exaggerated">John Gruber</a>. <a href="http://www.isuppli.com/mobile-and-wireless-communications/news/pages/reports-of-windows-mobiles-death-are-greatly-exaggerated.aspx">And this</a> should prove the point:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite intensifying competition and the loss of some high-profile licensees, the usage of Microsoft Corp.&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Windows Mobile operating system in smart phones will nearly triple from 2009 to 2013, allowing it to reclaim the No.-2 position in the global market, according to iSuppli Corp.</p>
<p>In 2013, 67.9 million smart phones will use the Windows Mobile operating system, up from 27.7 million in 2009. This will give Windows Mobile a 15.3 percent share of the global market in 2013, second only to the Symbian operating system, which will control 47.6 percent.</blockquote></p>
