<p>NEC Viewtechnology's projector business and NEC Display Solutions' display monitor business will merge and be called NEC Display Solutions. This will be effective April 1. Yoshiaki Tsuda will be President of the new company. I am sure NEC is very serious about streamlining operations as this is the second announcement of merging businesses. According to information reported by Huliq, NEC Viewtechnology was the second largest supplier in the business projector market in 2006. NEC Display Solutions was established in January 2000 and plays in the public information and public display markets with its LCD monitors.</p>
