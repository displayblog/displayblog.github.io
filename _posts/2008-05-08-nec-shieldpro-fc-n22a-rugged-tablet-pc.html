<p>The display is 12.1" and has a 4x3 aspect ratio and a pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=%221024+x+768%22">1024 x 768</a>. Ah, the good 'ol XGA format. But with the added functionality of touch. If you want rugged you'll need to toss out the CCFL backlight and replace it with a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=%22led+backlight%22">LED backlight</a> and that is just what NEC did with the FC-N22A. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led">LED</a> is solid state and that means it is much more durable than CCFL, which is a glass tube.</p>
<p>I'm sure there are other rugged tablet PCs out there but there aren't that many. And the name <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=nec">NEC</a> doesn't quite strike you to be the company that makes one of those few. NEC's ShieldPRO FC-N22A is rugged <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=%22tablet+pc%22">tablet PC</a> and is IP55 compliant. What does that mean? IP55 compliance means that the contents of structures or devices are protected from dust and water. </p>
<p>Look at the price: &acirc;&sbquo;&not;2,800. That can mean just one thing: the FC-N22A is geared for non-consumer use and for commercial use like the military, AT&T installers, law enforcement, etc. Of course, if you're the rugged type that likes to compute, roll in the dirt and blog outside while it is raining, the FC-N22A rugged <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=%22tablet+pc%22">tablet PC</a> might be just the ticket. Of course, you'll need to be fairly well to do to fork over that much money.</p>
