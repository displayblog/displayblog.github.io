<p>According to iFixit's teardown of the MacBook Air, some juicy information has been revealed regarding the LCD:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display assembly weight: 465g (34% less than on the MacBook)</li>
<li>LCD panel thickness: 3mm, thanks to the LED lightsource.</li>
<li>Inverter board: None needed due to the use of DC-powered LEDs.</li>
<li>Cable: Just one that provides both data and power to the display.</li><br />
</ul><br />
Apple and its display supplier(s) have done a tremendous job of thinning down and simplifying the design. I have also been told the glass used to manufacture the LCD is just 0.25mm thick. Also, the LCD panel uses Chip on Glass (COG) technology to incorporate a lot of driver ICs and other circuits directly on the glass.</p>
