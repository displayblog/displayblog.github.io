<p>The new iPod touch that Apple just announced has an anemic image sensor that allows 960x720 for stills and 1280x720 for videos. Does that make sense? I would think if the sensor is capable of 1280x720 for videos that you'd be able to take 1280x720 stills.</p>
<p>Or maybe the videos aren't 1280x720. Maybe they are actually 960x720 passed off as HD video. Does anyone know for sure?</p>
