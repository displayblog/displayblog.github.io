<p>[ <a href="http://www.wsj.com/article_email/taiwans-foxconn-offers-5-3-billion-to-take-over-sharp-1453348809-lMyQjAxMTA2MTI1MTIyMjEwWj">The Wall Street Journal</a> ] Foxconn has bid about &yen;625 billion (~US$5.3 billion) to take over Sharp. Japan's Innovation Network Corp., which owns a controlling stake in Japan Display Inc. (JDI) has also offered a bid of &yen;300 billion for Sharp.</p>
<p>Japan wants Sharp to remain a Japanese company, but it depends on Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. and Mizuho Financial Group Inc.; together are owed between &yen;500 and &yen;600 billion. Will they&nbsp;choose&nbsp;money or patriotism?</p>
<p>Here's my take. Foxconn builds a lot of stuff for a lot of companies including Apple. Apple procures most of its displays from LG Display (LGD). If Foxconn succeeds in bidding for Sharp, Foxconn&nbsp;will most likely be able to&nbsp;offer&nbsp;incredible deals&nbsp;integrating LCDs manufactured by Sharp to Apple and other companies like Dell, HP, etc.</p>
<p>Both LGD and Sharp can manufacture displays with IPS technology with oxide/IGZO backplanes, though LGD is&nbsp;considered to be the best IPS LCD supplier in terms of&nbsp;quality, engineering,&nbsp;and&nbsp;quantity as of this writing. Foxconn&nbsp;might also be interested in Sharp's thin film solar panel manufacturing technology and capability.</p>
