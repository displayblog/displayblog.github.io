<p><a href="http://www.displaysearch.com/cps/rde/xchg/displaysearch/hs.xsl/110707_tft_lcd_panel_makers_to_maintain_capacity_utilization_rates_at_85_percent_in_q3_11.asp">DisplaySearch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Large-area TFT LCD panel price increases halted in mid-June due to an uncertain demand outlook for Q3&acirc;&euro;&trade;11. While demand is slowing down, especially in the TV market, the supply side is making adjustments to prevent drastic panel price fluctuations. Panel makers originally expected to raise capacity utilization&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the ratio of actual output to total available capacity&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to an average of 90% in Q3&acirc;&euro;&trade;11. However, as indicated in the July edition of the DisplaySearch <em>MarketWise-LCD Industry Dynamics</em>, TFT LCD capacity utilization will remain at 85% from July to September.</blockquote></p>
<p>Around this time of the year the supply chain works overtime to fill up inventories for fourth quarter sales. Usually. And that means utilization rates hover around 90%. The overall utilization rate in May was 80%. </p>
<p>With a struggling economy, an uncertain future with the end of Quantitative Easing 2 (QE2), and the disappearing middle class in the U.S. I am unsure if folks in the U.S. will have enough disposable income to buy all the LCD TVs, monitors, notebooks, tablets, and smartphones that the industry is currently manufacturing.</p>
