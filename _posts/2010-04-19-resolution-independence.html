<p>Apple is finally getting serious about resolution independence on displays. In the Mac OS X Reference Library there is reference titled <em><a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/HiDPIOverview/HiDPIConcepts/HiDPIConcepts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003409-CH3-SW4">Resolution Independence Guidelines</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Resolution independence allows greater flexibility with high-density displays by allowing a Quartz point to map to any number of pixels (or fractions thereof). You can no longer assume a 1:1 correspondence between a Quartz point and an onscreen pixel...</blockquote><br />
Many years ago a typical LCD sported a resolution of about 72 PPI. A Quartz point had a scale of about 72 units per inch and one Quartz point mapped to about one pixel. Not any more:</p>
<blockquote><p>One a 144 dpi screen, a 200 x 200 image is one quarter the size of a comparable image on a 72 dpi screen.</blockquote><br />
Of course in displays we typically use <em>pixels</em> per inch or PPI. But the point here is that developers cannot assume a 1:1 ratio between a point and an onscreen pixel. Apple is introducing The Scale Factor, which is a new parameter that determine the ratio between a point and an onscreen pixel. At the moment a scale factor of 1.0 corresponds to 72 PPI. A display with 144 PPI will result in a scale factor of 2.0. Look at the example below. The physical font size stays the same between the two displays but with the higher resolution 108 PPI display with a 1.5 scaling factor the font is made up of more pixels and is <em>much</em> smoother.</p>

I'm very excited that Apple is moving toward resolution independence with its developers. This will in turn make higher resolution displays eminently more valuable. <em>via</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/04/19/mac-os-x-resolution-independence">Daring Fireball</a></p>
