<blockquote><p>Largan Precision has declined to comment on market rumors indicating the company will be the sole lens module supplier for Apple's upcoming iPad 2 [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>Largan is presumed to be supplying Apple its 5-megapixel lens modules for the iPhone 4. The next iPad should sport at least one camera, a front-facing one, for FaceTime functionality. Makes sense to me. A back-facing camera though I find less useful.</p>
