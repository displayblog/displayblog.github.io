<p>A CDMA version of the Nexus One is coming, soon. That means Verizon Wireles but it also means South Korea and Japan. Android has 27% share of smartphone OSes in North America in Q4'09 but very little elsewhere (largest in Western Europe with 8%) in the world according to AdMob (<em>via</em> <a href="http://www.geek.com/articles/mobile/mobile-firefox-coming-to-android-but-not-iphone-os-20100128/">Geek</a>). In Asia the fight is between iPhone OS (27%) and Symbian (69%). With a CDMA version of the Nexus One, it will be interesting to see what happens in Asia especially in South Korea and Japan.
