<p>Brian X. Chen, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/technology/apple-smartwatch-and-bigger-iphones-to-be-introduced.html?pagewanted=all">The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;I believe it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s going to be historic,&acirc;&euro; said Tim Bajarin, a consumer technology analyst for Creative Strategies who attended the original Mac event in 1984. He added, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;The design of this product is all Tim&acirc;&euro;&trade;s fingerprints.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>Bajarin is referring to Apple's wearable device rumored to be announced in a couple of days. But I'm certain Tim Cook &mdash; unlike Steve Jobs &mdash; isn't involved in designing Apple's products.</p>
