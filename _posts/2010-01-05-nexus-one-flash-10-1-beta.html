<p><strong>FLASH + NEXUS ONE = MOBILE HULU:</strong> In my very humble opinion, Adobe's Flash is at its best on Hulu. :-) Flash 10.1 Beta is shown working on the newly released Nexus One superphone (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWOocHwcLo&amp;feature=player_embedded">YouTube link</a>). Although Flash-based ads are a necessary evil to monetize websites (some Google AdSense ads on DisplayBlog use Flash) too many of them will certainly slow down the site and degrade the overall experience.</p>
<p><strong>FLASH = DATA TRAFFIC:</strong> Although Flash can certainly be further optimized to prevent CPU-hogging, it is also the responsibility of website designers to put a reasonable limit on Flash-based ads to maintain a certain degree of site usability. This becomes much more important and urgent for sites since Android smartphones will begin en mass surfing the net. I wonder how T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless 3G networks will hold up to the significant increase in traffic.
