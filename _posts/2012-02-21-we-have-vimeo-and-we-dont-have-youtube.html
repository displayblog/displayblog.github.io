<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/02/21/apple-google-cold-war">John Gruber</a>. <a href="http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/44418/vimeo-not-youtube-gets-instant-share-mountain-lion">Stuart Miles, Pocket-lint</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most interesting of the three is the inclusion of Vimeo over YouTube, a choice that is bound to give the professional video-sharing site a boost in awareness and audience numbers, but also leave users wondering why no Google support from day one?</p>
<p>When asked why there was no YouTube support at the moment in the developer preview, Apple told Pocket-lint: "We have Vimeo, and we don't have YouTube."</blockquote></p>
<p>Going forward, if there is a strong alternative to Google's service, Apple will go with the alternative. I expect this to apply to both OS X and iOS. As for Vimeo v. YouTube, I prefer the cleaner look of Vimeo embeds. The new iOS-friendly embed code makes it even better. And most importantly the type and quality of videos on Vimeo are superior.</p>
