<p>On July 8, 2009 the United States Customs and Border Protection agency issued a ruling stating that all current <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=vizio&amp;sa=Search#1505">Vizio</a> TVs do not infringe <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=funai&amp;sa=Search#1626">Funai</a> Electric's US Patent No 6,115,074 ('074). That means Vizio can go about its business of importing its TVs into the US. What is oxymoronic is that Funai's '074 patent was issued a Final Rejection by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) back on March 13, 2009. Not surprisingly Vizio has filed a lawsuit against Funai for unlawfully and unfairly discriminating against Vizio. FYI, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/04/16/philips-opts-out-of-lcd-tv-business-funai-takes-over/">Funai is the company that bought the rights to the Philips TV brand</a> for five years in the US and Canada.</p>
