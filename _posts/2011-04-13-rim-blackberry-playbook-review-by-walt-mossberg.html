<p>Walt Mossberg at <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703730104576260953631631640.html?mod=WSJ_PersonalTechnology_LEADTop">The Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The screen is beautiful, even though it has a lower resolution than the iPad's. And the cameras are better than the iPad's.</blockquote></p>
<p>Resolution. Marketing folks sure botched this one. Here's what it means according to <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/resolution">Webster</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>6 b : a measure of the sharpness of an image or of the fineness with which a device (as a video display, printer, or scanner) can produce or record such an image usually expressed as the total number or density of pixels in the image <a resolution of 1200 dots per inch></a></blockquote></p>
<p>In other words, the term resolution does not refer to a format like 1024x600, but instead to something like 169 pixels per inch. Resolution is a term to describe density. So. The PlayBook has a resolution of 169 ppi; the iPad 132. The PlayBook has a <em>higher</em> resolution than the iPad. It should instead read:</p>
<blockquote><p>The screen is beautiful, partly due to a higher resolution than the iPad's.</blockquote></p>
<p>I think we all know this: just because a camera's image sensor has more pixels does not necessarily mean it produces photographs with better quality. Though the iPad takes some crummy stills, it does a fine job of capturing 720p video out back. There's also the <em>experience</em> of capturing videos. I've used smartphones that capture 1080p HD video, but because of lag the experience was terrible. I'd like to know if capturing video on the PlayBook is lag-free and enjoyable, like on the iPad.</p>
