<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lenovo">Lenovo</a>'s IdeaPad U8 is a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=mobile-internet-device">mobile Internet device</a>, or MID. The U8 has a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=4.8"">4.8"</a> wide TFT LCD but the pixel format is unknown. I would hope it is at least <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=800-x-480">800 x 480</a>, hopefully more. The USB dongle is required to receive the China Multimedia Mobile Broadcasting (CMMB) signals and that makes it a bit less elegant. But the whole idea of a 173mm (6.8") portable device is a bit, let's say, in the dead zone. <a id="more"></a><a id="more-2324"></a></p>
<p>The reason why I say this is because when I was visiting my family in South Korea and showed them my shiny new <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=iphone">iPhone</a> last year the response was twofold: "Cool!" and "It's kinda big." The iPhone is 4.5" tall. The U8 is 2.3" more. My question to anyone who is thinking of getting the U8 is this: "How will you carry it?"</p>
<p>Another source of less-than-elegance is the stylus. In a world that is rapidly moving toward finger-touch, the U8 seems to take a step back. Of course, the UI will need to be finger-centric for finger-touch to work and from the picture, it looks like the U8 was designed to work with a stylus.</p>
