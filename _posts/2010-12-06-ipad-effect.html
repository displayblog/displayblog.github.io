<blockquote><p>A lack of competitive tablet PC products from other brands continues to drive Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s market share in the mobile PC segment. As the iPad continues its worldwide rollout, one developed region where the acceptance of the iPad has been weak is Japan, however. Questions of local language content and language-specific apps have slowed acceptance in this tech savvy region.</blockquote></p>
<p>One million Samsung Galaxy Tabs sold in two months (see: <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/12/03/samsung-galaxy-tab-one-million-sold/">Samsung Galaxy Tab: One Million Sold</a>). I'd consider that competitive.</p>
<p>And there is an explosion of iPhone apps in Japan (see: <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/11/29/iphone-cracks-japan/">iPhone Cracks Japan</a>). A Japanese iPad app explosion isn't too far off.</p>
