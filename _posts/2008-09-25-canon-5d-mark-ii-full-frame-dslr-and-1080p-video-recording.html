  5D Mark II is a full frame digital SLR (<a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dslr\">DSLR</a>).
  It improves on the original 5D on many accounts. The full frame CMOS sensor has
  a total of 22.0 million pixels with 21.2 million of them effective. The largest
  files will have a pixel format of <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=5616-x-3744\">5616
  x 3744</a>. The image processing duties will be done by the latest generation
  <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=digic4\">DIGIC 4</a>.
  The live view LCD is <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=3\"\">3\"</a>
  and sports 920,000 pixels with a viewing angle of 170/170. There are three brightness
  levels that adjust automatically depending on the lighting conditions. Very impressive
  for a LCD stuck to a DSLR. All of these improvements are not earth-shattering for
  a high-end DSLR, but there is one feature that blows all other DSLRs out of the
  water. And that's the 5D Mark II's video recording capabilities. "

<p>During Live View mode, the 5D Mark II can record <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1080p">1080p</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a>) movies at 30fps (that's a throughput of 38.6Mbps) and encodes it in Quicktime <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=h.264">H.264</a> format (MOV extension). You would assume that a DSLR with this capability wouldn't be able to compete with the likes of dedicated Full HD camcorders. And you would also be very wrong.<br />

<p><a href="http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2008/09/hd-video-shot-w.html">Wired's Gadget Lab has a blog post about Vincent Laforet</a>, a photographer who was able to negotiate with Canon to allow him to play with the Canon 5D Mark II for a couple of days. Vincent look the 5D Mark II and shot some amazing video footage. I'm not sure what exactly the video is about but concentrating on the video quality, I will say that it is quite amazing. Being able to use any lens that can be attached to the 5D Mark II for 1080p video recording puts the 5D Mark II in a league of its own. Have a look yourself: <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/dlc/controller?act=GetArticleAct&amp;articleID=2086">Reverie by Vincent Laforet</a>. You'll need Quicktime to watch it.</p>
