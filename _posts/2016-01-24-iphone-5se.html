<p>[ <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2016/01/22/apple-readies-iphone-5se-not-6c-for-marchapril-with-curved-edges-live-photos/">9to5 Mac</a> ] Mark Gurman:</p>
<blockquote><p>The new device is internally codenamed &ldquo;N69,&rdquo; but the launch name will likely be the &ldquo;iPhone 5se.&rdquo; The &ldquo;se&rdquo; suffix has been described in two ways by Apple employees: as a &ldquo;special edition&rdquo; variation of the vintage 4-inch iPhone screen size and as an &ldquo;enhanced&rdquo; version of the iPhone 5s. Indeed, the upcoming &ldquo;5se&rdquo; features a design similar to 2013&rsquo;s flagship but upgraded internals, software, and hardware features that blend the old design with modern technologies from the past two iPhone upgrades.</blockquote><br />
An iPhone 5 with the iPhone 6's curved cover glass and internals. I don't know. iPhone 5se sounds a bit much for Apple.</p>
<p>Just the other day my friend SooSang and I were reminiscing about old games. He had taken his family to a video arcade in Oakland packed with old video games like Street Fighter, Donkey Kong, Galaga, Defender, Phoenix, Centipede, Pac Man, etc. He also mentioned he has a Mac SE.</p>
<p>SE. I guess Apple <em>did</em> use that so they <em>could</em> use it again. I guess.</p>
