<p>Ben Popper, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/8/27/6074079/primetime-twitch-is-bigger-the-cnn-msnbc-and-mtv">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>One year ago the video game live-streaming platform wasn't even equal to HLN in size. Fast-forward to this summer and Twitch is bigger during prime-time hours than CNN, E!, or MSNBC, with occasional spikes that put it above MTV as well.</blockquote></p>
<p>Gregor Aisch and Tom Giratikanon, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/26/technology/charting-the-rise-of-twitch.html?_r=0">The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Twitch&acirc;&euro;&trade;s peak viewership now rivals the average prime-time viewers of some cable networks, as seen in the chart above. But compared with online video giants, Twitch is small. In hours of video viewed each month, Netflix is roughly eight times larger than Twitch, and YouTube is roughly 24 times larger, according to statistics from each company.</blockquote></p>
<p>Traditional TV is dying.</p>
