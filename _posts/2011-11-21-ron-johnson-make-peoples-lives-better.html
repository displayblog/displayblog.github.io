<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2011/11/rj-apple-store/">Ben Brooks</a>. Ron Johnson, J.C. Penny CEO and former Apple VP for retail, in an interview with <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/11/what_i_learned_building_the_ap.html">Harvard Business Review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>People come to the Apple Store for the experience &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; and they're willing to pay a premium for that. There are lots of components to that experience, but maybe the most important &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; and this is something that can translate to any retailer &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; is that the staff isn't focused on selling stuff, it's focused on building relationships and trying to make people's lives better.</blockquote></p>
<p>From my personal experiences at Apple Stores the one thing that could make my life even better is if the stores themselves were bigger, much <em>much</em> bigger.</p>
