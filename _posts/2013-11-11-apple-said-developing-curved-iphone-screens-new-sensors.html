<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-10/apple-said-developing-curved-iphone-screens-enhanced-sensors.html">Tim Culpan & Adam Satariano, Bloomberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Two models planned for release in the second half of next year would feature larger displays with glass that curves downward at the edges, said the person, declining to be identified because the details aren&acirc;&euro;&trade;t public. [...]</p>
<p>With screens of 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches, the two new models would be Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s largest iPhones, the person said [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>4.7- and 5.5-inch displays with glass that curves downard at the edges? Does anyone outside of a few select employees at Apple know what display sizes the next iPhone will sport? Maybe a few individuals at display manufacturers who will be supplying Apple for the iPhone 6 program. So let's assume for the sake of argument "the person" is one of these select individuals who know. (You're in big trouble if Apple finds out who you are.)</p>
<p>Apple is working on <em>two</em> larger displays for the iPhone? Apple hasn't done that, but recently Apple has done things it hasn't done before. For instance Apple has never introduced two new iPhones (iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s) at the same time. Maybe Apple is working on two iPhones with different displays: XL, L, M. The 5.5-inch iPhone XL would be geared to those who have large hands and ladies with large purses to carry them around, the 4.7-inch iPhone L would be the mainstream version, and the 4-inch iPhone M would be for those with smaller hands. This is unlikely, but possible.</p>
<p>With glass that curves downward at the edges. I thought about this for a second and the only thing that makes sense to me is if the cover glass takes up the entire top and comes down to where the sides are chamfered. That would make the design even more seamless. With <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2013/11/05/apple-to-open-another-us-factory-a-sapphire-plant-in-mesa-arizona/">Apple investing in a sapphire plant in Arizona</a>, my guess is the current Gorilla Glass-like cover glass will be replaced with one that is made of sapphire. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohs_scale_of_mineral_hardness">Sapphire has a value of 9 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness. The only mineral that's harder is diamond with a value of 10</a>. Except for the display itself the edges of the current iPhone design is most prone to scratches so a sapphire cover glass that curves downward at the edges could solve this problem, in addition simplify the industrial design, and make it easier to integrate for the folks at Foxconn.</p>
