<p><a href="http://www.lge.com/about/press_release/detail/21152.jhtml">LG</a>: LG just announced its W53 SMART Monitor Series displays. The three cool features about these displays are: Auto Brightness, Cinema Mode, and a Proximity Sensor. Auto Brightness automatically adjusts the brightness of the monitor. Cinema Mode blacks out everything but the video you're watching. And the Proximity Sensor lights up the control buttons when your finger gets close.</p>
<p>Thanks to an ambient light sensor the W53 SMART Monitor Series displays the brightness is automatically optimized based on the ambient lighting in the room. It also depends on the content your viewing. I'm not exactly sure how that works but probably has something to do with backlight brightness modulation that will also improve contrast ratio to some extent. This feature was developed in response to many users complaining that the display was either too bright or too dark. I guess these users don't know that there are buttons to adjust the brightness on almost any monitor. But it does get cumbersome when you work during the day and the night and have to adjust the brightness every time.</p>
<p>Another benefit of this feature is that power consumption is reduced especially at night when the backlight is dimmed.</p>
<p>When the W53 SMART Monitor Series is put into Cinema Mode and you're watching online videos, everything else is blacked out. All you see is the video. I think this is kind of nifty. But, there are many users that watch video and work at the same time. I do that from time to time. For people like me just don't turn on the Cinema Mode. For others, this feature should enhance your video viewing pleasure without having to resort to full screen mode (and the ugly pixelation).</p>
<p>Why would you need something like this? The W53 SMART Monitor Series has a proximity sensor on the bezel. When your finger approaches the bezel the buttons light up. Very cool. Pull your finger away and the buttons disappear. Physical buttons might be less cool and sexy but they consume zero power. I have mixed feelings here: these proximity sensor buttons are cool but they will always be additional sipping power while your monitor is on. How often do you adjust your monitor settings anyway?</p>
<p>LG will bring out sizes that range from 18.5-inch to 27-inch with 21.5-inch and larger ones sporting 1920x1080 pixel formats. Dynamic contrast ratio (which doesn't mean a whole lot) is rated at up to 50,000:1. The response time is really quick at just 2ms.</p>
