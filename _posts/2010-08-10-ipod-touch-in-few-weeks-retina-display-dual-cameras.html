<p>According to Daring Fireball's <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/08/10/dell-streak">John Gruber</a>, the next iPod touch will be coming shortly, in a few weeks actually and will be sporting the Retina Display from the iPhone 4 and dual cameras for your FaceTiming pleasure. I also <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/08/06/2010-ipod-touch-ios-4-two-cameras-a4-retina-display/">shared a similar story</a> a few days ago conjecturing the 2010 iPod touch will feature the Retina Display, dual cameras and the A4 CPU. I'm very excited about the next-gen iPod touch because I think with iOS 4, multitasking and Skype I can finally save a bundle on my regular voice plan from AT&T. I plan to go prepaid.</p>
