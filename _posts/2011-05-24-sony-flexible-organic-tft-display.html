<p><a href="http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20110523/191996/">Tech-On!</a>: Sony showcased its flexible display made of organic TFTs (Thin Film Transistors). The 13.3-inch O-TFT flexible display has a curvature radius of 5 mm, a pixel format of 1600x1200 good for a resolution of 150 ppi.</p>
<p>Flexibility in an e-paper-like display is most important because it lends to durability, just like paper. Some think rollable displays are exciting. I'm not one of them, because although I appreciate the beauty of antiques (e.g. ancient scrolls) I don't see rolled up documents integrating well into our lives. On the other hand, I <em>am</em> excited about foldable displays: imagine a small smartphone-like device with a display that can fold out to the size of a tablet. Foldable displays can solve one of the main challenges we have today in electronics: portability versus usability, largely limited by display technology and size.</p>
