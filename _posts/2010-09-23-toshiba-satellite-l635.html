<p>Toshiba and Best Buy are working together to create the Satellite L635, a ruggedized notebook PC geared for kids. The rugged parts include a rubberized wipeable keyboard with protected corners. Specs include: a 13.3-inch LCD, dual-core Intel Celeron P4600 CPU, 2GB RAM, DVD drive, 250GB hard drive. Kid-centered included software: NetNanny (parental control), KidZui (browser), Lego Batman, etc. Priced at US$499 and available only at Best Buy on September 26th. I think this is a fantastic idea. Make the computer a bit more rugged geared for kids who are a bit more rough with electronics.
