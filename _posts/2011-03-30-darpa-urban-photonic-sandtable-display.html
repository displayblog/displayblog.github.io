<blockquote><p>Many of today&acirc;&euro;&trade;s conflicts occur in urban settings, making the ability to visualize conditions in urban areas increasingly important to commanders and mission planners.  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) recently completed a five-year program called Urban Photonic Sandtable Display (UPSD) that creates a real-time, color, 360-degree 3D holographic display to assist battle planners. Without having to wear 3D goggles or glasses, a team of planners can view a large-format, interactive 3D display. Until now, two-dimensional, high-resolution flat panel color displays and 3D static monochrome images have been the most advanced visual planning tools available.</blockquote></p>
<p>Full 360-degree holographic objects with 12 inches of depth based on full-parallax 3D technology that can be scaled up to six feet diagonally. Amazing.</p>
