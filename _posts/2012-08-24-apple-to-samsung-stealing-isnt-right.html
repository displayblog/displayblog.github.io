<p><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/24/samsung-apple-reactions/">The New York Times</a>: Katie Cotton, Apple spokesperson, responding to the jury's decision to award Apple over US$1 billion in damages for patent infringement by Samsung:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are grateful to the jury for their service and for investing the time to listen to our story and we were thrilled to be able to finally tell it. The mountain of evidence presented during the trail showed that Samsung&acirc;&euro;&trade;s copying went far deeper than even we knew. The lawsuits between Apple and Samsung were about much more than patents or money. They were about values. At Apple, we value originality and innovation and pour our lives into making the best products on earth. We make these products to delight our customers, not for our competitors to flagrantly copy. We applaud the court for finding Samsung&acirc;&euro;&trade;s behavior willful and for sending a loud and clear message that stealing isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t right.</blockquote></p>
<p>Copy, but innovate, and make it yours. Samsung failed to do the more important last two parts.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.08.25:</em> <a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/08/25/pass-the-costs-along">Marco Arment</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What&acirc;&euro;&trade;s really going to disrupt the iPhone is going to be something <em>completely different</em>, not something that tries so hard to clone the iPhone that it hits Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s patents.</p>
<p>Unoriginal manufacturers will need to pay for their unoriginality. The most reasonable course of action, therefore, is to truly innovate and design products that aren&acirc;&euro;&trade;t such close copies.</blockquote></p>
