<blockquote>When our next batch of stock arrives, this will be used to fulfill our outstanding back orders but we won't be taking any additional orders via Telesales.</blockquote><br />
That's the word from Vodafone regarding <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=htc+hd2&amp;sa=Search#1386">HTC's HD2</a>. Interestingly the HD2 has generated a "massive amount of interest" and the initial stock sold out quickly. So why is Vodafone not planning to take any additional orders? Engadget seems to think the reason is the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=iphone&amp;sa=Search#1348">iPhone</a>, which will be sold through Vodafone starting 2010 in the UK and Ireland. Maybe Vodafone is not confident it will be able to sell enough iPhones if the HD2 competes? Wouldn't it be better to have two popular phones to sell than just one? Something smells fishy.
