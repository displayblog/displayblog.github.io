<p>Christina Farr, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/10/us-apple-launch-fashion-idUSKBN0H502C20140910">Reuters</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Roseanne Morrison, fashion director for The Doneger Group, an industry consultant, said the design fell short of her expectations.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not pretty,&acirc;&euro; she told Reuters. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;It's very future techno as opposed to feminine sexy.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>Feminine sexy would alienate about 50% of the market.</p>
<blockquote><p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;The Apple Watch will be a status symbol to carry,&acirc;&euro; he said. But the design is &acirc;&euro;&oelig;generic in the sense of its flexibility and individualization.&acirc;&euro; With the exception of the bright colors and gold trim, he added, it is &acirc;&euro;&oelig;a very masculine watch.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>Note to InStyle Magazine fashion news director Eric Wilson: you don't carry the Apple Watch, at least most people won't. I disagree that the Apple Watch is very masculine. The Apple Watch is neither feminine or masculine. It's not unisexual either; it's asexual, just like all of its products.</p>
