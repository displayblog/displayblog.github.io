<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-8931 aligncenter" title="VIZIO_XVTPRO720SV_72inch_3D_Wireless_LCD_TV" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/VIZIO_XVTPRO720SV_72inch_3D_Wireless_LCD_TV.jpg" alt="VIZIO_XVTPRO720SV_72inch_3D_Wireless_LCD_TV" width="480" height="412" /></p></p>
<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/05/vizios-2010-xvt-lcds-go-up-to-72-inches-with-3d-led-wifi-and-wi/">Engadget</a>: VIZIO will be bringing out its 72-inch XVTPRO720SV LCD TV in August. The 480Hz LCD TV will be feature 3D, WirelessHD, VIZIO Internet Apps, WiFi N but for not so much: US$3499.</p>
<p>3D is based on SENSIO technology and Bluetooth-synchronized active shutter XpanD LCD glasses. A VIZIO XVT Pro Wireless HDMI Adapter will be available separately to pump video from four HDMI sources using the 60GHz band. I am glad to see VIZIO moving toward a simpler design theme for its high-end XVT series. I just hope the VIZIO logo doesn't light up, which is very distracting in a dark room.</p>
