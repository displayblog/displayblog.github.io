<p>Citadel Securities analyst Shing Yin <em>via</em> a phone interview with <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/07/sprint-iphone">Wired</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The main thing for Apple is increased distribution, which is more important now than when the iPhone was first released.</blockquote></p>
<p>When the first iPhone was released on June 29, 2007, Apple was the underdog and AT&T was willing to take the risk. Not today.</p>
<p>Will the next iPhone be available on Sprint? I don't see why not. This is mere conjecture, but by using a Qualcomm chipset that supports both GSM and CDMA networks, the next iPhone should be network agnostic.</p>
