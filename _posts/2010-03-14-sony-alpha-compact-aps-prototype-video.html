Sony is unto something exciting: mating a APS-sized image sensor and a compact digital body. Currently compact digital cameras sporting the Micro-Four Thirds system have significantly increased the capabilities of compact digitals but still fall short of DSLR quality. Although the Micro-Four Thirds image sensors are quite a bit larger than those used in typical compact digital cameras, they are still small compared to those used in DSLRs, namely APS-sized image sensors. By combining a much larger APS image sensor into a compact digital body Sony is changing the game. Sony claims DSLR quality but I think this new prototype will fall short, mainly because of smaller optics in the lens compared to the larger full-bodied cousins. Still, I am quite excited about what Sony is doing. If priced right, I think we've got a revolution at hand.</p>
