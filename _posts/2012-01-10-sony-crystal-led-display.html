<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/01/09/sony-fights-the-oled-future-with-new-crystal-led-prototype/">Engadget</a>. From Sony's press release:</p>
<blockquote><p>The "Crystal LED Display" is a self-emitting display that uses Sony's unique methods to mount ultrafine LEDs in each of the Red-Green-Blue (RGB) colors, equivalent to the number of pixels (approximately six-million LEDs for Full HD). The RGB LED light source is mounted directly on the front of the display, dramatically improving the light use efficiency. This results in images with strikingly higher contrast (in both light and dark environments), wider color gamut, superb video image response time, and wider viewing angles when compared to existing LCD and plasma displays, with low power consumption.</blockquote></p>
<p>Now this is a <em>real</em> LED TV. All those "LED TVs" Samsung and others have been marketing are fakes. Specs: 400 nits, ~180&deg; viewing angles, unlimited contrast, 100%+ NTSC color gamut. With that many LEDs this prototype if made for sale will likely sport a stratospheric price.</p>
