<p>This is interesting news. First of all, the guys at The Sydney Morning Herald thinks that a 4.3" panel is being used for mobile phones. I haven&#39;t seen even a PDA have that big of a screen let along a mobile phone! That&#39;s no mobile phone with a 4.3" display, it&#39;s a micro-PC or something else! Anyway, I&#39;m not sure if these guys know what they are talking about. They state that Samsung SDI developed a 4.3" active-matrix OLED (AMOLED) with 3D for mobile phones. Go figure.</p>
