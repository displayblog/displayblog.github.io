<p>Matt Brian, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/17/4437310/ford-dashboard-buttons-sync-myford-touch">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to Raj Nair, Ford's VP of engineering for global product development, owners have complained that its systems make it difficult to switch radio stations or change the volume. As a result, the company will reintroduce physical controls having spent "a lot of time with customers to find out what exactly are the areas that are bothering them."</blockquote></p>
<p>I don't think touch display technology is viable for automotive applications involving the driver. In fact, I think touch displays are dangerous because it forces the driver to take his eyes off the road. Ford is doing the right thing; <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/12/20/tesla-model-s/">Tesla</a> should reconsider as well. Physical controls are best, but if that's not an option, I prefer voice--such as <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/10/4414368/apple-wwdc-ios-in-the-car">iOS in the Car</a>--over touch.</p>
