<p><a href="http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=2280617">Gartner</a>: I'm amused when a market research firm like Gartner <em>states</em> what will happen in 2016. I'm willing to bet Gartner's predictions 24 months or more into the future has less than a 10 percent accuracy. For example, <a href="http://www.gsmdome.com/blackberry/gartner-predictions-not-so-accurate-especially-concerning-android-and-rim-market-share-evolution_23172">Gartner predicted in 2011 that Microsoft would be selling 68 million smartphones in 2012</a>. <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/mobility/smart-phones/microsoft-phone-sales-jump-139-in-q3/240134938">In Q3'12 Microsoft sold four million worldwide</a>. Even if we assume sales double in Q4'12, Gartner's prediction was more of a wild guess. Perhaps Gartner is better at predicting TV trends?</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.gfk.com/group/press_information/press_releases/010238/index.en.html">GfK</a>, China has the highest smart TV penetration of 44 percent followed by South Korea (18 percent), and India (17 percent). I prefer "dumb TVs" but perhaps I'll change my mind when/if <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/gene-munster-on-apple-tv-2012-11">Apples does its thing with TVs</a>.</p>
