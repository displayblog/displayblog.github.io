<p>Sony released its KDL-46X200, 46" Full HD (1920 x 1080) LCD TV in the UK in July. The enhanced BRAVIA Engine EX upconverts video up to 4x to fill the vast screen real estate populated by more than 2 million pixels. The unit has 2 HDMI and 3 SCART inputs. Contrast ratio is 1300:1, and has a PAL/NTSC tuner.</p>

<p>The 46" TFT LCD TV panel is most likely manufactured by S-LCD, the joint venture between Samsung and Sony. The display technology is based on S-PVA or Super Patterned Vertical Alignment and boasts really high contrast ratios, in the middle, but the ratio falls off fast when you're viewing from off-angle positions. Of course, most LCD TVs have this limitations. DLP, LCoS or LCD rear projection TVs do not suffer as much when it comes to off-angle/off-axis viewing. The backlight is an improved CCFL designed called WCG-CCFL or Wide Color Gamut-CCFL. A typical CCFL provides 72% of NTSC colors but with recent developments in response to the potential of LED backlights, CCFL manufacturers have improved their decade-old designs to offer up to 92% NTSC.</p>
