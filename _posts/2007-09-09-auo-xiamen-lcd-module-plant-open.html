<p>AU Optronics (AUO) announced the second LCD module plant in China. AUO's new module plant is located in Xiamen, China where it joins the other plant that began volume production in April 2007. By the end of 2007 production capacity may reach 500,000 units per month for large-area LCD modules and 5,000,000 units per month for small/medium LCD modules. Many LCD companies have already setup LCD module plants in China. The modularizing process is very labor intensive and with China's ultra-cheap labor, it is no wonder.</p>
