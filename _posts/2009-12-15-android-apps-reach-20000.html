<p>According to <a href="http://www.androlib.com/appstats.aspx">AndroLib</a>, there are now more than 20,000 applications for the Android platform and it took just over a year. To compare, the iPhone hit the 100,000 milestone in early November and the 50,000 mark in the first year. Acceleration-wise the iPhone wins, by a mile, but as with most things slow and steady wins. Let's see if Android can keep up its momentum. I wonder what would happen if <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/12/15/smartphone-with-ads/">Google starts selling its Nexus One ad-subsidized</a>...</p>
<p>More than 60% of those are free. That's significantly more&Acirc;&nbsp; than the less-than-25% figure for iPhone apps. Free apps are great but the eco-system is based on generating profits and it seems the iPhone platform is where you should be.</p>
