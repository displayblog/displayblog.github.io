<p>Terrible news for those who have ordered <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250:8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID:11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=27-inch+imac&amp;sa=Search">27-inch iMacs</a> from Apple. The reason for the delay is some issues with the beautiful 27-inch <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250:8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID:11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=ips&amp;sa=Search">IPS</a> TFT LCD sporting a grand 2560 x 1440 pixel format. The problem seem to center around the ATI Radeon HD 4670 and 4850 graphics cards that lead to flickering and yellow-tinging. Apple resellers were told delays of 2 weeks for Apple to replace these graphics cards on the 27-inch iMacs.
