<p><a href="http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1800514">Gartner research vice president Carolina Milanesi</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We expect Apple to maintain a market share lead throughout our forecast period by commanding more than 50 percent of the market until 2014. This is because Apple delivers a superior and unified user experience across its hardware, software and services. Unless competitors can respond with a similar approach, challenges to Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s position will be minimal. Apple had the foresight to create this market and in doing that planned for it as far as component supplies such as memory and screen. This allowed Apple to bring the iPad out at a very competitive price and no compromise in experience among the different models that offer storage and connectivity options.</blockquote></p>
<p>Gartner projects iPad shipments to go from 14,685,000 in 2010 to 46,697,000. Android will grow too: 2,512,00 to 11,020,000.</p>
