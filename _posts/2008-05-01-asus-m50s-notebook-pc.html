<p>According to PC Perspective the ASUS M50S notebook PC has a lot of gloss on the back and on the inside. They seem to like the gloss. For me, I don't particular like gloss because gloss means a lot of fingerprints. I do take care of my high-tech gadgets very well but I don't like having my fingerprints all over the units. There are exceptions: a touch-device like the iPhone is meant to be touched and fingerprints on the LCD is acceptable because that's just how it is. But on a notebook's cover? I don't want my fingerprints there. On a TV? No problem because I probably will not be touching the TV's casing all that much.</p>
<p>The 15.4" LCD has a pixel format of 1440 x 900 and is powered by NVIDIA's GeForce 9500M GS with plenty of memory: 512MB. The HDMI connector is a plus as more and more LCD monitors have them and in case you feel like you want to connect the M50S to your LCD TV, the HDMI will come in handy, especially since it has a Blu-ray reader. The unfortunate thing is that you won't take full advantage of the Blu-ray videos with just a pixel format of 1440 x 900. You'll need 1920 x 1200 for that. Although there are 15.4" LCD panels with a pixel format of 1920 x 1200, you'll need to adjust the DPI settings in Windows to make the fonts large enough to read comfortably.</p>
