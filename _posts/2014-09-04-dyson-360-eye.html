<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/04/dyson-vacuums-enter-robotic-age-with-360-eye-and-a-smartphone-app">James Dyson</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most robotic vacuum cleaners don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t see their environment, have little suction, and don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t clean properly. They are gimmicks. Vision, combined with our high-speed digital motor and cyclone technology, is the key to achieving a high-performing robot vacuum &mdash; a genuine labor-saving device.</blockquote></p>
<p>The 360 Eye name refers to a 360-degree panoramic camera on top of the machine that sees the entire room, maps out the room, and plots its navigation. The high-speed digital motor James Dyson is referring to is the company's &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Radial Root Cyclone&acirc;&euro;¬ù technology powered by its V2 digital motor. The 360 Eye will be released in Japan first in Spring 2015.

<p>If the 360 Eye works anything like the ten-year old DC18 I have at home, I will need to get one.</p>
