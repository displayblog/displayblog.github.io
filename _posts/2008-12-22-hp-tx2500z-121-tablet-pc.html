<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=hp">HP</a>'s tx2500z is the successor to the tx2000 with an upgraded CPU and GPU. According to NotebookReview the tx2500z has a "solid chassis and design" with an overall design that is very similar to the older tx2000 that it is replacing. The Imprint Finish with Echo design has a nice appearance. Since the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=12.1"">12.1"</a> TFT LCD is using a resistive touch technology, display performance is a bit degraded, something the guys at NotebookReview noticed as "kind of grainy". The LCD is glossy, reflective and sports a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1280-x-800">1280 x 800</a> pixel format.. The reflectivity will make it difficult to read in very bright environments where light can bounce off right into your eyes. The Radeon HD 3200 GPU is an integrated graphics solution but is the first integrated graphics solution that is "genuinely capable of playing 1080p video without skipping frames or playing many 3D video games with reasonable frame rates". That means not only can you be quite productive with the touch capabilities (and digitizer for taking notes), you can also enjoy some movies and play games without having to endure too much pain waiting for the computer to respond. HP is offering $399 worth of savings with free upgrades to 3GB (from 1GB), 250GB (from 160GB), free shipping (from $49) and an instant $200 rebate.</p>
