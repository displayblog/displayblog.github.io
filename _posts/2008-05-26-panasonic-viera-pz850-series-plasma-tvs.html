<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=panasonic">Panasonic</a>'s Viera PZ850 series plasma TVs are web-enabled allowing direct access to online websites such as YouTube, Google's Picasa and Bloomberg. I would think other sites such as Flickr, FaceBook, MySpace, etc. will eventually be accessible too, since they are just as, if not more, popular.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a> pixel format of all Viera PZ850 plasma TVs is nothing special, but the contrast ratios are. The native contrast ratio is a very high 30,000:1. But the most impressive specification of Panasonic's Viera PZ850 series is the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dynamic-contrast">dynamic contrast</a> ratio: it is 1,000,000:1. That's 1 million to one. Wow. These are probably the first fruits of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=matsushita">Matsushita</a> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/04/25/pioneer-and-matsushita-forge-alliance/">working with Pioneer</a> and incorporating some of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=pioneer">Pioneer'</a>s best technologies, such as its <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=kuro">KURO</a> plasma technology that make black worthy of its name. Gamers will be happy to note that the Viera PZ850 series has a Game Mode that minimizes lag time.</p>
