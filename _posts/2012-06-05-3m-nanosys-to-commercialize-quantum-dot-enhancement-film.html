<p><a href="http://news.3m.com/press-release/company/nanosys-and-3m-bring-amazing-color-consumer-electronic-displays">3M</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A quantum dot, which is 10,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair, can emit light at a very precise wavelength. The ability to control the spectral output of a quantum dot allows QDEF to create an ideal white backlight specifically designed for LCDs. Trillions of these quantum dots are packaged into a thin film that fits inside an LCD backlight unit. QDEF replaces a similar film already found inside LCD backlights, which means that adding QDEF to manufacturing processes requires no new equipment or process changes for the LCD manufacturer.</blockquote></p>
<p>Precision alignment of RGB color wavelengths emitted by a QDEF to the color filter should have a significant impact on color purity on LCDs. Check out the <a href="http://www.nanosysinc.com/media-room/photos/">photos of a QDEF enhanced iPad</a>; the difference is quite noticeable.</p>
