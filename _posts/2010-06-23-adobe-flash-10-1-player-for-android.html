<p>Adobe has released its Flash Player 10.1 to its mobile partners and should be integrated into Android 2.2 a.k.a. Froyo. The final production release of Flash Player 10.1 for smartphones and tablets will be available upon upgrading to Froyo. Here is the list of gadgets that will get updated to Froyo: Dell Streak, Google Nexus One, HTC EVO 4G (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/18/david-pogue-reviews-htc-evo-4g/">David Pogue Reviews HTC EVO 4G</a></em> for more info), HTC Desire, HTC Incredible, Motorola Droid, Motorola Droid X (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/15/motorola-droid-x/">Motorola Droid X</a></em> for more info), Motorola Milestone, and Samsung Galaxy S (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/17/samsung-galaxy-s-with-super-amoled/">Samsung Galaxy S with Super AMOLED</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/21/super-amoled-is-decent-in-the-sun/">Super AMOLED Is Decent In The Sun</a></em> for more info), etc. Device partners include ARM, Brightcove, Dell, Google, HTC, Intel, Microsoft, Motorola, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, RIM, Samsung, Texas Instruments and more. Hopefully the final version of Flash Player 10.1 will take less time to load videos and require less bandwidth than the beta.
