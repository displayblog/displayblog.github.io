<p>The Financial Times expects Apple's tablet to launch immediately:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple is preparing an announcement next month that many anticipate will be the official unveiling of its tablet, but the company has so far declined to confirm the existence of the device.</blockquote><br />
I don't think Apple will be at CES 2010. Apple wants to do things its way and through smaller press events it has done quite well in marketing its products, software and services. If Apple has a tablet to launch soon the question then becomes whether the company will introduce it before CES or after. My bet is before: press invitations will go out next Tuesday on the 29th and then the event will be held in Cupertino on the 5th of January. Then everyone headed to CES will be disappointed with all the less-than-tablets at the show. Just a hunch.
