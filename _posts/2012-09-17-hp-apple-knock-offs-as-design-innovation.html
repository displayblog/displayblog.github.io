<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/17/3346080/hp-ceo-meg-whitman-personal-computer-innovation">Nathan Ingraham, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Whitman even said that "Apple taught us that design really matters," and feels that HP has "made a lot of progress" with its new lineup. While the company may have an attractive line of new products that will help show off Windows 8 when it launches this fall, it's hard to look at HP's latest as anything but excessively Apple-inspired.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/wolffman">Stacy Wolff</a> has been unifying the look and feel of HP products since the beginning of this year. Design unification? Yes, but design innovation is an altogether different story.</p>
