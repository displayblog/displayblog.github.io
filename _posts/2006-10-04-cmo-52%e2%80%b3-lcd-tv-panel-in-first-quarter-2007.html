<p>Chi Mei Optoelectronic&acirc;&euro;&trade;s (CMO) 52&acirc;&euro;&sup3; LCD TV will sport a Full HD resolution of 1920 x 1080, a brightness of 500 cd/m2, a contrast ratio of 1500:1, and a 6ms response time. The 52&acirc;&euro;&sup3; monster will be built on CMO&acirc;&euro;&trade;s G5.5 LCD fab that can cut two 52&acirc;&euro;&sup3; panels at a time. A G5.5 is more optimized for larger LCD monitors such as the newly introduced 19&acirc;&euro;&sup3; wide and 22&acirc;&euro;&sup3; wide monitors. With a monthly capacity of its G5.5 plant at 120,000 glass substrate input going up to 180,000 by December, you can bet CMO will be churning out a lot of 52&acirc;&euro;&sup3; LCD TVs to make a lot of profits. If you want to have a look at the 52&acirc;&euro;&sup3; LCD TV from CMO, hop on over to <a href="http://expo.nikkeibp.co.jp/fpd/english/">FPD International 2006</a> that will be held from October 18 - 20 in Yokohama, Japan.</p>

<p>But let&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not get too excited here: We&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve already seen a 100&acirc;&euro;&sup3; LCD prototype (and I really mean prototype) from LG.Philips LCD (LPL) at SID 2006 at the Moscone Center in San Francisco this year. Also, Sharp is already shipping a 65&acirc;&euro;&sup3; LCD TV, which I saw at a Magnolia store in Palo Alto, California. And don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t forget Samsung&acirc;&euro;&trade;s 82&acirc;&euro;&sup3; prototype.</p>
