<p>Are you a BlackBerry user who wants to check out Android but don't want to give the integrated QWERTY keyboard experience? The Motorola Droid Pro was designed just for you. The Droid Pro sports a 3.1-inch TFT LCD on top and a QWERTY keyboard on the bottom. The display is slightly on the small side with a last-generation 480x320 pixel format but it shouldn't be much of a concern for its target audience. The Droid Pro runs Android 2.2 and will be available on Verizon for $179.99 after a $100 mail-in-rebate with a new two-year contract on the 18th of November.</p>
