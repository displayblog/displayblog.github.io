<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/tech-europe/2011/11/18/four-keys-to-apples-success/">The Wall Street Journal</a>. Greg Joswiak, VP of iPod and iPhone Product Marketing at Apple, spoke about the four keys to Apple's success at <a href="http://www.svc2c.com/">Silicon Valley Comes to Cambridge</a>. I like the fourth one:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t enter the market and try and be the best in it, don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t enter it. You need that differentiation. At Apple if we can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be the best then we are not interested in it.</blockquote></p>
