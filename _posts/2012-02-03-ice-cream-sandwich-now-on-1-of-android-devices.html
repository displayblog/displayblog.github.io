<p><a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/02/android-ics/">Ben Brooks</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In other words it is big news that software that is two versions old is now on the majority of devices and that three months in 1% of devices are using the latest version of Android.</blockquote></p>
<p>Wonderful.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> <a href="https://forums.motorola.com/pages/00add97d6c">Motorola Owners' Forum</a>: Only the WiFi-only Motorola Xoom got an ICS upgrade according to Motorola. All others will need to wait until Q2 or Q3'12.</p>
