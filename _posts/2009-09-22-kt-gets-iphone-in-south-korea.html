  Accepted</strong> The Korea Communications Commission (KCC), South Korea's communications
  regulator, decided on Wednesday, September 22, to allow the sale of Apple's <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=iphone&amp;sa=Search\">iPhone</a>.
  Mobile phones sold in South Korea must use domestic technology for location-based
  services such as GPS. The KCC has stated that the built-in mapping capabilities

  used for a long time to protect its domestic market. For instance, in 2005 the KCC
  created a rule to block <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=smartphone&amp;sa=Search\">smartphones</a>

  by requiring the use of domestically created software for Internet functions. It

  to be sold only to corporate users. "

<p><strong>iPhone Accepted</strong> The Korea Communications Commission (KCC), South Korea's communications regulator, decided on Wednesday, September 22, to allow the sale of Apple's <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=iphone&amp;sa=Search">iPhone</a>.

<p><strong>Next Month</strong> KT Corp. is the second largest cellular service company in South Korea, behind number one SK Telecom, based on the number of subscribers. It is not certain if <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=apple&amp;sa=Search">Apple</a> will work exclusively with KT or with all three including LG Telecom, but KT will start selling the iPhone next month.</p>
<p><strong>Local Domination</strong> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=samsung&amp;sa=Search">Samsung</a> and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=lg&amp;sa=Search">LG</a> dominate South Korea's mobile phone market. Average prices for their mobile phones are roughly double the average prices they receive outside the country. Similar to the US before Apple shook things up with its iPhone, South Korea's telecom companies control the sale of mobile phones and the software that is used. If the iPhone sells well, the way cellular business is done in South Korea might drastically change. The price of the iPhone is still unknown, but if US prices are any indication, Samsung and LG will need to drastically cut prices to compete.</p>
