<p>Ryan Heise asks, "<a href="http://dinnerwithandroid.tumblr.com/post/13840155188/who-is-any-of-this-good-for">Who is any of this good for?</a>" Heise mentions four things out of which I'll focus on one. <a href="http://www.splatf.com/2011/12/verizon-google-wallet/">Dan Frommer</a> puts it well:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, Google is keeping one of its most interesting new applications &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Google Wallet, for mobile payments &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; off its best new Android phone. Why? Because its operator partner, Verizon, wants it to.</blockquote></p>
<p>Pure Google experience? <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/12/06/frommer-google-wallet">John Gruber</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is hypocrisy, pure and simple.</blockquote></p>
<p>Heise:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is about Google having no real control over its platform, to the point where &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Android&acirc;&euro;¬ù just becomes another marketing bullet point for dozens of bullshit phones in the market.</blockquote></p>
<p>* This is actually good for someone: the carriers.</p>
