<p>An AT&T customer representative <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2011/05/04/atandt-rep-apple-has-told-us-no-new-iphone-in-june-or-july/">MacRumors</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple has informed us that they do not plan to release the iPhone in the June to July timeframe, though there will be a newer version in the future. Unfortunately, we have not been given a release time for the new phone. We will release this information on our website when it is available to us.</blockquote></p>
<p>Oh shucks.</p>
