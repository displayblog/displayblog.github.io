<p><a href="http://www.liquipel.com/in-action/">Liquipel</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Liquipel is a revolutionary process that applies a waterproof coating to your electronic device to protect them in the event of accidental exposure to liquids. It is not visible to the human eye, virtually undetectable and Liquipel will not compromise the look, feel, and performance of your electronics.</p>
<p>Liquipel penetrates the entire device as a whole, including all of the vital components inside and out to provide optimal protection against accidental contact with liquids.</blockquote></p>
<p>US$59 and up. I want.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> <a href="http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/43935/hzo-waterproof-nano-tech-samsung-apple">HzO</a> is another company with waterproof nano coatings.</p>
