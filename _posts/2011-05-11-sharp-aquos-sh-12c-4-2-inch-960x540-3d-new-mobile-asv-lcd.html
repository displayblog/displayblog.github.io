<p>Akihabara News: The Sharp AQUOS Phone SH-12C incorporates a 4.2-inch 3D New Mobile ASV (Advanced Super View) LCD with a pixel format of 960x540. On the back are two cameras for capturing 3D photos and videos.</p>
<p>The 960x540 pixel format is exciting and I look forward to many more smartphones challenging the resolution on the class-leading 3.5-inch Retina Display with a 960x640 pixel format.</p>
<p>I'm not too hot on 3D especially on something like a phone that I have to constantly look at everyday, but for those who can't get enough 3D the SH-12C sounds like just the ticket. The 3D Android smartphone from Sharp will be available on Docomo on May 20 in Japan.</p>
