<p><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_24/b4232056703101.htm">Stephen Elop</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>That upsets me&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;not because some of you are using iPhones, but because only a small number of people are using iPhones. I'd rather people have the intellectual curiosity to understand what we're up against.</blockquote></p>
<p>There are a million tiny things that make the iPhone and iOS great. To figure them out you need to use the iPhone and get intimate, really intimate. Elop is getting his troops to understand that you should keep your enemy <em>very</em> close to you.</p>
<p>I think Nokia and Microsoft has what it takes to bring about a combination of smartphone hardware and OS that will give serious competition to Apple. Microsoft should buy Nokia and fully integrate the hardware-making capabilities into its genes and go head-to-head with Apple.</p>
