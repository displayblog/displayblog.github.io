<p><a href="http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/sir-jonathan-ive-the-iman-cometh-7562170.html">Jonathan Ive</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What I love about the creative process, and this may sound naive, is this idea that one day there is no idea, and no solution, but then the next day there is an idea. Where you see the most dramatic shift is when you transition from an abstract idea to a slightly more material conversation. But when you make a 3D model, however crude, you bring form to a nebulous idea and everything changes &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; the entire process shifts. It galvanises and brings focus from a broad group of people. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a remarkable process.</blockquote></p>
