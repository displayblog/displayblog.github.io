<p><a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/11/08/consumer-reports-iphone-4s">Marco Arment</a> on the madness of Consumer Reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>They also say the iPhone has &acirc;&euro;&oelig;one of the best cameras we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve seen on a phone&acirc;&euro;, but that wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t enough to earn the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;excellent&acirc;&euro; dot-circle rating.</blockquote></p>
