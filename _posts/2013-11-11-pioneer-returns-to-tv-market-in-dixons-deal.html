<p><a href="http://ertonline.co.uk/ERT%20Latest%20News/Pioneer-returns-to-TV-market-in-Dixons-deal.htm">ERT</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pioneer is to return to the European TV market this year as a Dixons Retail exclusive brand.</p>
<p>The Japanese consumer electronics manufacturer has signed a deal with the electrical retailing chain, which sees Dixons granted the exclusive rights to source and develop products and sell Pioneer TVs in selected European markets.</p>
<p>The roll-out of the launch will begin in December, with Pioneer TVs sold in the Nordics. There are plans to enter the UK market in the future.</blockquote></p>
<p>I got excited there for a second. Unfortunately, these Pioneer TVs will not have anything to do with KURO plasma technology. Instead the 40, 46, and 55-inch TVs will be LED-backlit LCD TVs.</p>
