<p>So why did Trusted Reviews not like the F2620LVD very much? Not-so-good build quality was one: "...the finish is flimsy and plasticky..." I don't mind simple black housings for LCD TVs--I actually prefer it, so I wouldn't knock the F2620LVD on those grounds as TR did. Another area that fell short of TR's expectations: one HDMI and one SCART connections; TR expected 2 each. Next items: horrible OSD and remote control. Remote control was too lightweight and plasticky with a non-functional 'up' button. OSD was extremely ugly, small, and tricky to read.</p>
<p>There's more... Next: weird DVD action. I can't explain it better than TR, so here goes: "...the DVD slot on the rear left side will only take in discs if you first select 'DVD' from the source list..." So don't just try to stick in the DVD in the slot and expect the TV to start playing the DVD; it doesn't work that way with the F2620LVD--and you need to have the printed side facing away from you. Weird indeed. Next: "... black level response sucks." Pretty clear and here are two reasons why: One, dark is not dark. Two, vertical stripes--seven of them. Anything good? Why yes, the 26" LCD TV is "surprisingly" sharp and less-than-expected motion blur. Bottomline: "... unfortunately things fall apart so disastrously during dark scenes that the TV becomes at times borderline unwatchable." Ouch.</p>
