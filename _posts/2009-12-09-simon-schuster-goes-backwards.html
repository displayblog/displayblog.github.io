<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704825504574584372263227740.html">The Wall Street Journal</a>: Simon &amp; Schuster CEO Carolyn Reidy announced that digital versions of 35 of its major releases in early 2010 will come out <em>four</em> months after the physical release. One of the main motivations behind this decision is to maximize profits. For instance a hardcover can command a significantly higher price than a paperback. And paperback is pricier than the digital version. Money concerns has led Simon &amp; Schuster to make the wrong decision about digital books.</p>
<p>What type of customer purchases a Kindle? Someone who is an avid reader. Someone who enjoys near-instant access to purchased books and especially new releases. Not to disrespect Simon &amp; Schuster's CEO but clearly she has not done her homework! Or maybe someone didn't do a good enough job researching the digital book revolution for her. Avid readers will want the digital version on their Kindle as fast as possible. And if it is a really good book some of them, maybe a lot of them, will want to purchase an archival version, a real one, to complement the digital one. By artificially delaying digital releases Simon &amp; Schuster is going backwards and other publishers will leave this company in the digital dust.</p>
