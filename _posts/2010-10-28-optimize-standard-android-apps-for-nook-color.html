<blockquote><p>The Nook Color won't run apps straight out of the Android Market, but that doesn't mean it can't run them&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;in fact, they've done a lot of tests on apps from standard Android smartphones and they "pretty much run on Nook Color," which has Android 2.1 under the hood...</p>
<p>So porting Android apps isn't difficult. B&N says it's more like "optimizing" them for Nook than porting them.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Nook Color might turn out to be a cheap alternative to a real Android tablet. It will get rooted; it's only a matter of time.</p>
