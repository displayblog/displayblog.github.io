<p>Daring Fireball's John Gruber in "<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/01/ipad_big_picture">The iPad Big Picture</a>" on Apple's A4 CPU used in the iPad:</p>
<blockquote><p>... from what I saw today, Apple doesn't just own and control <em>a</em> mobile CPU, they own and control the hands-down best mobile CPU in the world. ... They're not getting into the CPU business for kicks, they're getting into it to kick ass.</blockquote><br />
I have little doubt an Apple-designed CPU will be used in the next iPhone and eventually the next MacBooks. At that point the iPhone will be considerably faster than any other smartphone and last significantly longer. Ditto for the MacBooks.</p>
