<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/07/samsung-9000-series-led-lcd-tv-eyes-on/">Engadget</a>: I guess <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/08/14/samsung-9000-series-led-tv-coming-late-2009/">Samsung was a few days late with its 9000 series</a> but the company is showing them off at CES 2010. The 9000 Series ultra-thin LCD TVs sporting direct-lit LED backlight technology from Samsung is really quite thin. But just being ultra-thin isn't going to cut it since LG put ultra-thin, local dimming and back-lit LED backlight into one, called <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/01/07/lg-led-lcd-hdtv-led-led-plus-full-led-slim/">Full LED Slim</a>. The 9000 Series from Samsung supposedly matches its Korean competitor with a direct-lit LED backlight and ultra-thinness. But I'm not sure if it makes use of local dimming.</p>
