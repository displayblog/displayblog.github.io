<p>Well... Just about an hour to go and someone who works at Shoreline allowed us to go inside. There are a total of six of us waiting and listening to elevator music. I'm thinking this will not be a packed showing. And I think I know why aside from the obvious reason being that this is a 2 1/2 hour movie that starts at midnight: tomorrow is a school day and a bunch of students have tests. I chalk this up to terrible timing. The marketing folks should have waited an extra day.</p>
