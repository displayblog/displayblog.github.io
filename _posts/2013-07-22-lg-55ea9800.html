<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/22/4546168/lg-curved-oled-hdtv-arrives-stateside-priced-14999">The Verge</a>: The LG 55EA9800 is a curved 55-inch OLED TV. The two prominent features are a thickness of 4.3 mm and that it's curved. Priced at US$14,999 the 55EA9800 will be widely available in the U.S. at Magnolia.</p>
<p>A 55-inch TV need not be curved since you're watching from a distance. The premium for this non-essential but interesting feature, for a TV, is too much. What I think would sell is a curved 21:9 30-inch OLED <em>monitor</em> with 4K, at one-tenth the price.</p>
<p><em>Update 2013.09.09:</em> <a href="http://www.displaymate.com/LG_OLED_TV_ShootOut_1.htm#Conclusions">Raymond Soneira</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But what makes this LG TV absolutely stunning is the combination of OLED display technology together with a very accurate factory calibration that delivers picture quality and accuracy that is visually indistinguishable from perfect based on our extensive Lab tests &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; a commendable and impressive achievement!</blockquote></p>
<p>Is perfect worth US$10,000?</p>
