<p>The words of Jeffrey Nelson (the title of this post), Verizon's public relations manager, after David Pogue asked him:</p>
<blockquote><p>But you're saying that you don't charge that $1.99 fee! Yet it's happened to hundreds of my readers, and it's happened to me. So what are we missing?</blockquote><br />
Then Nelson replies with the title of this post. Verizon Wireless replied to the FCC's request to explain itself regarding its tasteless business practice of charging $1.99 for accidentally pushing a strategically-placed Internet-connect button. Once connected, you're on the hook for $1.99. Verizon basically said that it does not do it. I wonder what happens to a company when it lies to the FCC.</p>
<p>I can personally attest to Verizon's lousy billing system that adds bogus line items almost every month that we had cellular service with the company. I don't know how many hours we spent on the phone with Verizon trying to sort out the bill. Every month. We don't do that anymore; we're on AT&amp;T.
