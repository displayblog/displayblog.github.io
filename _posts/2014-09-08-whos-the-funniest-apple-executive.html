<p>Dan Frommer, <a href="http://qz.com/261181/the-hidden-structure-of-the-apple-keynote/">Quartz</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Keynote humor these days typically involves poking fun at Microsoft, Google, or other Apple executives. To see who gets the most gags in, we logged the six most recent Apple events, recording who&acirc;&euro;&trade;s on stage for how long and how many times the crowd broke into laughter. While Cook can be unexpectedly funny, Federighi &dash; who spent the most time on stage &mdash; drew twice as many laughs.</blockquote></p>
