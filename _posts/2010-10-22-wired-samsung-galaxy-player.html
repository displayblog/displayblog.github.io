<p>Charlie Sorrel, <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/10/samsung-galaxy-player-better-than-ipod-touch/?intcid=postnav">Wired</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What it doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have is the Touch&acirc;&euro;&trade;s front-facing camera or its hi-res retina display.</blockquote></p>
<p>The only thing good about the iPod touch's Retina Display is the high pixel format. All the other goodies (wide viewing angle, excellent colors, etc.) you find on the iPhone 4's Retina Display is nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>As a comparison, Samsung's Super AMOLED is almost as good as the iPhone 4's Retina Display. That would mean that the Samsung's Galaxy Player's Super AMOLED is way better than the crappy display used on the iPod touch.
