<p><a href="https://www.abiresearch.com/press/q4-2013-smartphone-os-results-is-google-losing-con">ABI Research</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>ABI Research reports that Android once again dominated the Q4 2013 shipment numbers for smartphone advanced operating systems with 77% market share of over 280 million smartphones shipped in Q4 2013.Nearly one billion smartphones were shipped in 2013, Android accounting for 78% across the year.</p>
<p>Android&acirc;&euro;&trade;s dominance is not quite as rosy as it seems though, with most of the growth coming from forked Android operating systems (137% year-on-year), mainly in China, India, and adjacent markets. Forked Android or AOSP accounted for 25% market share with 71 million unit shipments, as opposed to certified Android&acirc;&euro;&trade;s share of 52%, of a total of 77% market share.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;The growth of AOSP is significant for Android&acirc;&euro;&trade;s owner Google, because AOSP does not offer Google&acirc;&euro;&trade;s services (due to their unavailability in China), impacting Google&acirc;&euro;&trade;s ability to monetize the Android ecosystem,&acirc;&euro;¬ù comments Nick Spencer, senior practice director, mobile devices.</blockquote></p>
<p>My answer to the question of whether or not Google is losing control of the Android ecosystem is this: According to data from ABI Research, yes, Google seems to be losing control of the Android ecosystem, especially in China.</p>
