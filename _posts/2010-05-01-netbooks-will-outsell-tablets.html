<p>ASUS CEO Jerry Shen doesn't expect tablet sales to be more than netbooks. ASUS will also launch its Eee tablet in early June at Computex. Unfortunately Shen has disclosed that the first versions of the Eee tablet will be making use of Microsoft software, which I assume will be either Windows 7 or Windows CE. I don't expect the Eee tablet to have a compelling experience no matter what UI is slapped on top of either OS from Microsoft. And in terms of tablet sales I'll agree that sales won't be more than netbooks, in 2010.
