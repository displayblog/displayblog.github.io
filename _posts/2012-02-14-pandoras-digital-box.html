<blockquote><p>If I found a reel of 35mm film in 500 years and didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t know what it was, I could probably without too much trouble figure out a way to reverse engineer a projector. In any case, I can always look at the individual frames, even without a projector, and see what is there.</p>
<p>If I find a cache of Blu-rays and DCPs in 500 years, what do I have? Plastic waste. How do you reverse-engineer those media? Impossible. Without an understanding of the software and the hardware, you have zip. No way to look at it, no way to know even if it has any information on it.</blockquote></p>
<p>I've been thinking I should digitize the dozens of MiniDV tapes I have. Now I'm thinking maybe I should put it on 35mm film, if such a service exists.</p>
