<blockquote><p>The most prominent part of the Vita hardware is the 5-inch, 960 x 544 Super AMOLED Plus display from Samsung, which takes up most of the front of the unit. It's absolutely gorgeous, with fantastic color reproduction and deep black levels that often make it hard to tell where the bezel stops and the screen begins. Viewing angles are very good, with the picture remaining clear at extreme positions, though like many other OLED displays it can take on a blueish tint when the system is tilted &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; you can see what&acirc;&euro;&trade;s happening on screen from nearly 180 degrees, but the color temperature is inaccurate unless you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re looking at it relatively straight on. The screen is glossy, but I found it generally easier to view outside than any PSP model ever was &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; it still didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t get great results in direct sunlight, though. With a pixel density of about 220ppi, we're not talking Retina Display (329ppi) or Galaxy Nexus (316ppi) levels of sharpness here, but at the distance you're likely to be holding the device, pixels are rarely distinguishable. Even when you can see the pixels, the RGB stripe arrangement makes everything clear and accurate &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; no PenTile graininess here.</blockquote></p>
<p>Overall the Samsung-built 5-inch Super AMOLED Plus display looks like a winner. The 960x544 pixel format is weird; it should have been 960x540.</p>
<p>The quote above seemed a bit long, and long-winded, so I wanted to shorten it. That ended up not being possible because I couldn't figure out his emphasis. Case in point: Fantastic color reproduction, but color temperature is inaccurate. Almost every thought is paired with a pro and a con. At times the cons have little to no relevance and seem manufactured. The entire paragraph is full of these.</p>
<p>Deep black levels are a good thing, but can't distinguish the screen from the bezel. Great viewing angles, but not-so-good color temperature. Glossy is bad, but better outside than previous PSPs, but overall not so good. Resolution of 220 ppi is not as good as the best, but you normally can't see the pixels, but if you do it's not bad at all and not as bad as PenTile.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/02/13/playstation-vita-review/">Sean Buckley, Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The PlayStation Vita's face is dominated by its luxuriously large 5-inch OLED display, and with good reason: this touchscreen not only pops with rich colors, crisp textures and deep blacks, but it's also the user's primary method of input outside of games. Yes, this gorgeous display is capacitive, and is responsive enough to make the 3DS' resistive screen feel decidedly dated. The 960 x 544 panel boasts some fantastically wide viewing angles, to boot. We did encounter a hiccup or two with the touchscreen, though. After sucking the battery dry during Engadget's requisite endurance tests, the rebooted handheld failed to respond to finger input. Things were right as rain after a hard reset, but we braced ourselves anyway -- the US release may have to ride the same bumps its Japanese counterpart hit late last year. (Note: shortly after the incident, our Vita was updated to system firmware 1.60, and as of this writing, the issue hasn't returned.)</blockquote></p>
<p>I like this better: straightforward.</p>
