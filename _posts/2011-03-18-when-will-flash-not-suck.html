<blockquote><p>The answer is always "soon".</blockquote></p>
<p>Flash 10.2 for Android was released today. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/03/18/flash-10-2-hits-android-today-adobe-hopes-for-viewable-720p-pla/">Sean Hollister</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>With our trusty Droid 2&acirc;&euro;&trade;s 1Ghz OMAP3 chip, we saw a slight but noticeable boost in framerate when playing a YouTube trailer at 480p, which admittedly only took took that particular video from &acirc;&euro;&oelig;unwatchable&acirc;&euro; to merely &acirc;&euro;&oelig;fairly jerky.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>I don't think it's far reaching to say that for most people fairly jerky is unwatchable.</p>
<blockquote><p>With the Tegra 2-toting Motorola Xoom, however, 480p videos ran perfectly smooth, even as the tablet had trouble rendering 720p content as anything but a series of images.</blockquote></p>
<p>A series of images? Isn't Motorola touting the wide aspect ratio of the Xoom, 720p playback, and Flash capability?</p>
