<p>Softbank is offering the 3G 16GB iPad for free, that is, of course, with a new two-year contract. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/29/softbank-makes-16gb-ipad-wifi-3g-free-with-two-year-contract/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>You see, there's no built-in monthly surcharge for this one; rather than paying off your iPad over 24 months, you're actually getting it for nothing as long as you're kosher with forking out &Acirc;&yen;4,725 ($56) per month for that 3G goodness.</blockquote></p>
<p>Softbank's promoting deal as "iPad for everybody" and starts on December 3rd.</p>
