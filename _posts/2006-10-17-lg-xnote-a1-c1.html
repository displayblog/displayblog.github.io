<p>Both the A1 and the C1 sport a 1.2GHz Core Duo CPU, an nVidia's GeForce 7300 Go GPU with 64MB, a 10.6" 1280 x 768 LCD, WiBro, HSDPA, and DMB. The C1 is a convertible notebook and weighs 2.8lbs. The A1 is even lighter at 2.2lbs.</p>

<p>Although Engadget states the resolution of the LCD as 1366 x 768, I am sure it is not. Instead, the resolution should be 1280 x 768 at 10.6". The 11.1" LCD panel from TMD that is used in Sony's TX series has a 16:9 aspect ratio and 1366 x 768 resolution and is the only small LCD that sports that ratio and panel resolution.</p>
