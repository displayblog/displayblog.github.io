<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/samsungtomorrow/5895933600/">Samsung Tomorrow</a>: It took 55 days for three million Samsung Galaxy S II smartphones to get sold. I'm assuming sold, as in got into the hands of a customer, and not merely shipped into the channel. The original Samsung Galaxy S took 85 days to hit three million. The Samsung Galaxy S II is the fastest-selling phone in history by the company with a rate of one sold every 1.5 seconds.</p>
<p>PS: The iPhone 4 sold 1.7 million units in three days. That's a rate of, interestingly, one sold every 0.15 seconds or so.</p>
