<p>That's one of ten reasons <a href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Mobile-and-Wireless/Apple-iPad-3-Might-Face-Trouble-at-Launch-10-Reasons-Why-109921/">Don Reisinger at eWeek</a> raised as to why Apple's iPad 3 might face trouble at launch. <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/162458/2011/09/macalope_busted_businesses.html">The Macalope</a> responds:</p>
<blockquote><p>Does everyone buy a new Mac every year? No. Do Macs still sell well every year? Yes. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?!</blockquote></p>
<p>That was number four. Reisinger's number six:</p>
<blockquote><p>Consumers Are Looking for Bigger Displays</blockquote></p>
<p>He's referring to the bigger 10.1-inch displays. What sayeth The Macalope?</p>
<blockquote><p>The screen on the iPad is 9.7 inches. The Macalope defies Don to find a meaningful collection of consumers who would buy an Android tablet over an iPad because of a 0.4-inch difference in the screen size.</blockquote></p>
<p>There's eight more where that came from; be sure to <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/162458/2011/09/macalope_busted_businesses.html">check it out</a>.</p>
