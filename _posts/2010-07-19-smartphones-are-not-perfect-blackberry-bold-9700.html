<p>Research In Motion (RIM) co-CEOs Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie as quoted in <a href="http://crackberry.com/rim-official-statment-response-apples-iphone-4-antenna-propaganda">CrackBerry</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>RIM is a global leader in antenna design and has been successfully designing industry-leading wireless data products with efficient and effective radio performance for over 20 years. During that time, RIM has avoided designs like the one Apple used in the iPhone 4 and instead has used innovative designs which reduce the risk for dropped calls, especially in areas of lower coverage. One thing is for certain, RIM's customers don't need to use a case for their BlackBerry smartphone to maintain proper connectivity.</blockquote><br />
Here are just a few YouTube videos that test the BlackBerry Bold 9700 for signal attenuation:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMvMvPQZIqQ">TheBerryFix</a>: Couldn't duplicate signal degradation.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwHrELfGN1w">ajstonet</a>: Video is very blurry but four bars stays at four.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzWZjeGD5GM">tompson16</a>: Signal remains strong at five, drops to four when gripping tightly.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TG3njXcrg0">babanoury</a>: Four bars shrink to two.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6X_PZhWhw">craigsmobileuniverse</a>: At the 3:27 mark. Signal drops from five to three.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMRF4q2SzMc">SmartphoneNation</a>: Drops from four to one.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aD_z-4d2oA">1timmahh</a>: Five down to zero.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pteTgxLZzs">TheAlSacco</a>: Five down to four using a tight grip with the right hand. Drops to three while gripping with two hands, stays around four.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UEOF7s4HiU">StickyGeko</a>: Five down to zero when cradled with two hands.</li><br />
</ul><br />
Twenty years of antenna design...</p>
