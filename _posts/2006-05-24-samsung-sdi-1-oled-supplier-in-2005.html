<p>According to market research firm iSuppli, Samsung SDI took 27.3% share of unit shipments of 14.5 million units in 2005. RiTdisplay was #2 with 26.9% share, shipping roughly the same amount of units. The market share of OLED revenue is quite different: SDI took 36.1% while RiTdisplay had only 21.5%. RiTdisplay's, according to Dr. Kimberly Allen, Director of Technology and Strategic Research for iSuppli, main staple was "low-end OLEDs for MP3 players." Hence, the lower revenue share compared to SDI, who focused on higher-end OLEDs.</p>
