<p>Microsoft has now changed Windows Phone 7 Series to just Windows Phone 7. What kind of company changes the name of a major initiative mid-way? Idiots. BTW, does this new smartphone OS have anything to do with Windows? No. Microsoft just wants to milk the Windows brand. I recommend the company change the name, again, to simply Phone 7.
