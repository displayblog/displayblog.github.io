<p class="P1">Reported by <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/displays/a20080204PD213.html">DigiTimes</a>, &Acirc;&nbsp;Lite-On Technology's LCD monitor OEM production base located in Dongguan, Southern China suffered a fire on February 3. The legal name of the production facility is Titanic Capital Services, a Lite-On Group affiliate. According to the report, there are 19 LCD monitor production lines and 15 were affected by the fire. Lite-On manufactures LCD monitors for Acer, Dell, HP, and Lenovo and these companies will certainly be impacted.</p></p>
<p class="P1">We are in a slow season when it comes to LCD monitor demand so the impact should be much less than if we were entering the second half of the year.&Acirc;&nbsp; However, the report indicates that HP would be hardest hit with the fire.</p></p>
<p class="P2">It is estimated that Lite-On will ship about 20 million OEM LCD monitors in 2008. Unless the&Acirc;&nbsp;damage to &Acirc;&nbsp;79% of its production capacity is minimized and restored quickly, it will be difficult to see a scenario where Lite-On can accomplish its goal. Other OEM manufacturers like Innolux Display, TPV Technology and others will likely see increased orders in the short term.</p></p>
<p class="P2">Economies of scale is extremely important when manufacturing commodity items such as LCD monitors but it seems a prudent move to diversity production just a bit in case emergencies strike as was the case with Lite-On.</p></p>
