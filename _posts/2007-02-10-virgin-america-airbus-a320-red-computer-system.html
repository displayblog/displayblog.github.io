<p>Virgin America will be entering the US market with an Airbus A320, but with an inflight entertainment, more accurately, multimedia computer and service system called RED. The US Dept. of Transportation has not cleared Virgin America for commercial flights just yet, but when it does this A320 will be, in my opinion, the best to fly in. Virgin America's RED include movies on demand, pervasive music playlists, in-seat messaging with a QWERTY controller, touchscreen Linux consoles with games, food ordering system, and more. In the "belly" of the Airbus A320 are three servers that communicate with RED in-seat consoles and satellite connection. There are also WiFi-enabled flight attendant handhelds!</p>
<p>
The display is a 9" touchscreen LCD with a 1024 x 600 pixel format. The OS is Linux and Virgin custom created all the applications. For ground communications VA is using Sprint's EV-DO uplink. Emails and SMS messages can be sent from your seat consoles by way of the USB joypad QWERTY keyboard. Interesting information abound as well as a video and you can find it all at <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/02/10/mega-hands-on-virgin-americas-airbus-a320-with-red-in-flight-e/">Engadget</a>.</p></p>
