<p><a href="http://global.epson.com/newsroom/2011/news_20111226.html">Epson</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In November 2009, Nokia filed lawsuits in the United States and United Kingdom against Epson and its subsidiary companies including Epson Imaging Devices Corporation alleging violations of antitrust and competition laws. Epson has denied liability and vigorously defended the lawsuits. Because of the ongoing impacts of the lawsuits on its business and the expense of continuing litigation, however, the company has determined that settlement of the litigation is in Epson's best interests.</blockquote></p>
<p>Settlement price: US$80 million.</p>
