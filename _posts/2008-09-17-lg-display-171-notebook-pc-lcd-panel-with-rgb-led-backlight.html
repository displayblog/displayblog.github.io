<p>On September 16, 2008, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lg-display">LG Display</a> announced that it has begun mass production of its <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=17.1"">17.1"</a> TFT LCD panel with a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=rgb-led-backlight">RGB LED backlight</a>. The RGB <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led-backlight">LED backlight</a> will allow the 17.1" LCD panel to feature a color gamut of 105% NTSC, unheard of for <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=notebook-pc">notebook PC</a> panels. Of course, because LG Display is forgoing CCFL technology the 17.1" LCD panel is mercury free. According to DisplaySearch, a market research firm based in Austin, TX, LG Display was the top supplier of notebook PC LCD panels with a 30.2% unit shipment share in 1H'08.</p>
<p>Imagine the possibilities of a notebook PC with a LCD panel like this. Notebook PC have horsepower that enable most users to do almost anything they want, including playing the latest 3D games. But one of the limitations has been that the LCD hasn't been quite there. Now at least those who require some serious color fidelity can look to a notebook PC with a LCD like this for a possible solution. Maybe <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=apple">Apple</a>'s next <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=macbook-pro">MacBook Pro</a> will sport one of these beauts.</p>
