<p>[ <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/23/technology/apple-unlock-iphone-san-bernardino.html">The New York Times</a> ] Katie Benner and Matt Apuzzo:</p>
<blockquote><p>Charlie Rose recently interviewed Mr. Vance and asked if he would want access to all phones that were part of a criminal proceeding should the government prevail in the San Bernardino case.</p>
<p>Mr. Vance responded: &ldquo;Absolutely right.&rdquo;</blockquote></p>
<p>This is Manhattan district attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr.</p>
