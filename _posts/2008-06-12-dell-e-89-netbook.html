  Electronics will be manufacturing Dell's E netbook. The 8.9\" offering from Dell
  is billed as \"The Eee Killer\" and will start going after them in August when it
  will be available for a REALLY small price of just $299. The 8.9\" LCD panels will
  be supplied by Samsung and Chi Mei Optoelectronics (CMO) and even AU Optronics (AUO)
  might get in on the action. All three display manufacturers will not be providing
  LCDs to Dell's E program at the same time, which sounds silly since I'm sure the
  E will be a great success simply due to the $299 price point. Source: <a href=\"http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20080714PD219.html\">DigiTimes</a>

Compal Electronics will be manufacturing Dell's E netbook. The 8.9" offering from Dell is billed as "The Eee Killer" and will start going after them in August when it will be available for a REALLY small price of just $299. The 8.9" LCD panels will be supplied by Samsung and Chi Mei Optoelectronics (CMO) and even AU Optronics (AUO) might get in on the action.

<p>Engadget has got some hot news about <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dell">Dell</a>'s new <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=netbook">netbook</a>s that are coming our way. First the name. Wow, Dell E! What a name. I know Dell isn't known for creative minds, but E? Come on. At least Dell's intentions are clear: it wants to go against the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=eee-pc">Eee PC</a> in a hot netbook market. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=8.9"">8.9"</a> E netbook comes in three flavors: Classic, Video and Video+. All three sport a 8.9" TFT LCD with a pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1024-x-600">1024 x 600</a> that is ideally suited for browsing the net. Classic would probably be slotted right at the bottom with a corresponding rock-bottom price. The E Classic is targeted at a first time PC buyer who is primarily going to browse the web and engage in some productivity applications. The Video and Video+ will have more RAM, more storage, webcams, etc.</p>

<p>I don't know about you, but among the three configurations, I think almost everyone will get the E Video+ with the additional 4GB of flash and Bluetooth; of course assuming it won't be significantly more expensive than the E Video.</p>
