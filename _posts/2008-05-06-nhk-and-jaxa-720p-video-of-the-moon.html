<p>The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and the Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) announced the successful capture of high-definition video of the Moon by KAGUYA, the lunar explorer that was launched into orbit at an altitude of about 100km on October 18, 2007 (JST). Onboard the KAGUYA is a high definition TV (HDTV) and this marks the world's first high definition image data acquisition of the Moon from an altitude of about 100km away from the Moon.</p>
<p>The beautiful images were captured twice on October 31, 2007. Both HD images were capturing via an eight-fold speed intermittent shooting method that compresses eight minutes of coverage into just one minute. The first shooting covered from the northern area of the Oceanus Procellarum toward the center of the North Pole and the second one was from the south to the north on the western side of the Oceanus Procellarum.</p>
<p>The HD images were received by JAXA's Usuda Deep Space Center and then processed by NHK. I wonder who will be first to capture a 1080p video of the Moon and then a 4K2K video and so on. The details are simply amazing even with just 720p. The pictures below are all copyrighted images from JAXA and NHK.</p>
