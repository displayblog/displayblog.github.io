<blockquote><p>In addition to coming to Apple TV, a new Showtime app that does not require a cable login is also hitting the iOS App Store. The app is not live yet, although it should rollout soon. The same $11/mo charge applies to it, as well. HBO&acirc;&euro;&trade;s standalone service costs $14.99, for comparison&acirc;&euro;&trade;s sake.</blockquote></p>
<p>FYI, <a href="https://secure.hulu.com/account/manage_addons">for Hulu subscribers SHOWTIME can be added for an additional US$8.99</a>. Content aggregation and streaming services like Hulu seem poised to be the next generation of 'cable'.</p>
