<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/10/19/entertainment-ecosystems">John Gruber</a>. Graham Spencer, <a href="http://www.macstories.net/stories/mapping-the-entertainment-ecosystems-of-apple-microsoft-google-amazon/">MacStories</a>: There are four points Spencer makes based on his thorough analysis of worldwide coverage for music, movies, TV shows, ebooks, and apps for the four companies:</p>
<ul>
<li>A convergence towards Apple's business model</li>
<li>All four companies are from the USA</li>
<li>Amazon faces an uphill battle</li>
<li>Apple is winning so far</li><br />
</ul></p>
