<p>The Manga Guide series of books are fantastic. Remember spending countless hours reading comic books when we were growing up. Maybe we still do! The characters sucked us in and hours upon hours zipped by as we followed their fantastic journeys. During my high school years Japanese anime became all the rage. I still remember one of my favorites, Bubble Gum Crisis. The Manga Guide series combines a bit of both. And then some.</p>

<p>You get to explore our solar system, the Milky Way, and other mysteries of our universe in <em>The Manga Guide to the Universe</em> with Gloria, Kanna, and Yamane. As you follow these three girls you gain knowledge of the universe almost without friction. It's not quite like reading Captain America or Iron Man, but it's about as far as you can get from a typical textbook. Learning <em>can</em> be fun; The Manga Guide series is proof. <a href="http://www.nostarch.com/download/mg_universe_ch01.pdf">Check out the first chapter on the heliocentric universe</a>.</p>
