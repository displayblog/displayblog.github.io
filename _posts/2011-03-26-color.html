<p>Bill Nguyen, Color founder, <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/exclusive-bill-nguyen-qa-2011-3">Business Insider</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Color is not about photo sharing. It's a new way to build spontaneous social networks -- and collect massive amounts of data about what people are doing and where they're doing it -- without collecting any personally identifiable information like last names, addresses, or even passwords.</blockquote></p>
<p>John Gruber at <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/03/25/color-digging">Daring Fireball</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>So it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a data mining trojan horse. Well, that changes everything. Who wouldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t love that? And it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a good thing personal photos have no &acirc;&euro;&oelig;personally identifiable information&acirc;&euro;¬ù &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; you know, other than images of you, your friends, and your family.</blockquote></p>
<p>Color seems to be an app that engenders the building of online communities by using information gleaned from location-based activities such as how much time you spend at a particular place, what photos you take, etc.</p>
<p>Mike Elgan at <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/why-youll-use-color-or-something-like-it/88190">Cult of Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Whatever you do, don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t dismiss Color. The idea of spontaneous location-based networks that use increasingly intelligent algorithms to connect content streams is going to be absolutely huge.</blockquote></p>
<p>Color sounds like an interesting app, but what's the big deal? Color raised US$41 million in funding from Sequoia and Bain. Forty one million.</p>
