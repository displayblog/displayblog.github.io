<p>Soyea, a TV manufacturer, is part of Westlake Electronics Group, a China-based conglomerate. The Chinese-language FPD Chinese via DigiTimes wrote the article but CMO is denying it. But it would be a good move, I think. S-LCD has Samsung and Sony to supply. LG.Philips LCD has LG Electronics and Philips Electronics to supply. IPS Alpha has Hitachi and a couple of others to supply. But the Taiwan or China-based companies have no captive customers when it comes to big-brand TVs. Of course, I've never heard of Soyea, but it's a start and I think it's a good move if it's true.</p>
