<p>HP has tapped Wistron to build its LCD TVs in 2007. Wistron will build 26", 32", 42" and 47" LCD TVs for HP. The 26" and 32" LCD TVs will have Chi Mei Optoelectronics (CMO) panels while the 42" and 47" LCD TVs will be sourced from LG.Philips LCD (LPL). CMO panels will likely be a vertical alignment (VA) based LCD while the 42" and 47" will be based on S-IPS.</p>
