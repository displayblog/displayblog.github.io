<blockquote><p>To summarize, the image uploader says iPad 3 (or whatever Apple chooses to call it) shipments are already coming out of China for delivery in three of America&acirc;&euro;&trade;s biggest airports. The poster also apparently says that initial deliveries will be made by Friday, March 9th. In typical Apple fashion, the cargo flight organizers are demanding unusual security for the cargo.</blockquote></p>
<p>If true, this is getting exciting.</p>
