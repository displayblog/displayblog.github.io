<p><a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/hp-chromebook-11/">Google</a>: The HP Chromebook 11 sports an 11.6-inch 1366x768 IPS LCD, charges <em>via</em> USB, and is priced at US$279. I think it'll be great for anyone who lives on the Internet and is looking for a cheap portable computer. Google-colored accents are a nice touch, but I think the black version looks best.</p>
