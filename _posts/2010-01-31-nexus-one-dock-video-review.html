<p>Kevin C. Tofel at jkOnTheRun <a href="http://jkontherun.com/2010/01/30/video-review-of-nexus-one-dock-is-it-worth-45/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+jkOnTheRun+%28jkOnTheRun%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">reviews the Nexus One dock</a> on video:</p>
<blockquote><p>It's just not seamless, yet.</blockquote><br />
A quick summary: The Nexus One can easily slide out of the dock because there isn't a USB connection on the dock: the connection is via Bluetooth. The clock app runs when docked, most of the time. Audio plays via Bluetooth, some times. The dock is $45 and you get an additional phone charger and a 3.5mm-to-RCA cable.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HsG4xCVb2s">Android Mom</a> also has a video showing how you can stream music via Bluetooth from the Nexus One to the dock, which is connected to her speakers.</p>
