<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=toshiba">Toshiba</a>'s Portege G810 smartphone features a fairly large <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=2.83"">2.83"</a> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=touch">touch</a>-enabled TFT LCD with the standard pixel format of 240 x 320. 3G might be big news for <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=apple">Apple</a>'s <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=iphone">iPhone</a>, but for the rest of the brands, offering <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=3g">3G</a> has been for a couple of years a requirement and standard practice. This is no different for Toshiba as its G810 has both 3G and WiFi. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=gps">GPS</a> is also included. </p>
<p>The G810 sports a better than average 3MP camera. Of course, as is the case with digital cameras more megapixels do not necessarily mean better pictures. In most cases more pixels mean less light, leading to worse pictures. Let's hope Toshiba got it right and incorporated a bigger lens, better image sensor and better image processing.</p>
<p>It is probably a good idea to have more than one way to navigate a smartphone. In the case of the G810 the touch LCD is one and the touch buttons on the bottom is the other. However, I really appreciate the UI on the iPhone precisely because it limits my choices and makes the whole process simple. If simple works, I would rather forgo options where almost always complexity tags along.</p>
