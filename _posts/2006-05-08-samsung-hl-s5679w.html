<p>The HL-S5679W has something that many DLP units don't: a LED BLU (backlight unit). Generally speaking, LED BLUs have not been bright enough and in order to increase brightness while maintaining lifespans hundreds if not thousands of LEDs have to be used. I am not sure how many LEDs are used in Samsung's HL-S5679W, but the specifications are fairly impressive with a 20,000 hour lifespan. Now, don't pooh-pooh that because it is less than the 50,000 hours that you see for LCD TVs and PDP TVs. 20,000 hours translate to almost 7 years if you watch your TV for 8 hours, every single day! Other features are: dual HDMI inputs, and 4000:1 CR. Also, this 56" DLP unit has a street price of around $4000, a great price!</p>
