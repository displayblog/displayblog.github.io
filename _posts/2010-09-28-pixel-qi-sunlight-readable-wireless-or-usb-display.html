<p><a href="http://pixelqi.com/blog1/2010/09/28/low-power-wireless-displays-made-possible/">Pixel Qi</a> announced the <a href="http://www.display-solution.com/">Display Solutions</a> d-screen-Qi10:</p>
<blockquote><p>Display Solutions AG has developed the d-screen-HYBRID driver board which has been combined with the low power, sunlight readable Pixel Qi 10&acirc;&euro;¬ù screen. This module can be plugged into a laptop (or even some phones) via USB for easy access to a second screen. Even better, you can skip the cables completely and use this second screen via wireless-USB: meaning the data is sent to the screen wirelessly and the screen runs on batteries alone.</blockquote></p>
<p>The specs on the 10.1-inch LCD: LED backlight, 1024x600, 262K colors, pure reflective mode (64-level grayscale, 3072x600 pixel format). That last bit I don't get: each sub-pixel is used as a single pixel?</p>
<p>The wireless option is based on DisplayLink technology. There's also the option of connecting the Pixel Qi display using Ethernet, which I think is really cool. The USB connection draws just 1.5W so no battery or power adapter is required. It would certainly be a cool feature to have tablets be able to connect to notebook PCs and be used as extra displays. Not as versatile as Pixel Qi / Display Solutions, but <a href="http://avatron.com/apps/air-display/">Air Display</a>, an app for the iPad and iPhone, allows the two gadgets to be used as extra displays. Air Display uses WiFi so anything other than static information will be pushing it.</p>
