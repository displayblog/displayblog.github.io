<p><a href="http://us.toshiba.com/kira/home">Toshiba</a>: The Toshiba KIRAbook is like a 13.3-inch retina MacBook Pro stuffed into a 13.3-inch MacBook Air. Unlike the 16:10 2560x1600 13-inch retina MacBook Pro the KIRAbook's 13.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and a 2560x1440 pixel format. Resolution is an impressive 221 ppi (Toshiba states a resolution of 217 ppi, which doesn't make sense), but falls slightly behind the Chromebook Pixel's 239 ppi and the 13.3-inch retina MacBook Pro's 227.</p>
<p>David Pierce at <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/17/4235660/toshibas-high-res-kirabook-takes-on-the-macbook-air-and-pro-all-at">The Verge</a> reports viewing angles are "pretty bad". I can't understand bad viewing angles on a US$1600 premium notebook where the display is one of its main attractions.</p>
<p>But are viewing angles important on a notebook? I don't move around much when I'm on my 17-inch MacBook Pro. I suppose most don't. So what good are excellent viewing angles? Well, let me put it this way: When I'm approaching my MacBook Pro from an angle and if the LCD had poor viewing angles with washed out colors I wouldn't have good feelings about it.</p>
