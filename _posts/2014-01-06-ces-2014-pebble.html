<p><a href="https://getpebble.com/steel">Pebble</a> announced Pebble Steel. As the name suggests the chassis has been upgraded from plastic to steel. A few notables: The incredibly thick display bezels remain. Pebble decide to adorn the bottom of the front face with its logo, a massive one. The result? A butt-ugly smartwatch. It's also an ugly watch, period. Here are some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make it a square.</li>
<li>Make it flat.</li>
<li>Make it thinner.</li>
<li>Reduce the display bezel. None would be best.</li>
<li>Get rid of any logos from the front face of the watch.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>At least Pebble did one thing right: The e-paper display is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass.</p>
