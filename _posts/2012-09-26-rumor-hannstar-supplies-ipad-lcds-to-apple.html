<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20120925PD210.html">DIGITIMES</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The rumors claimed that since Apple has been decreasing its orders to Samsung Electronics for panels used in the iPad due to disputes between the two companies, the US vendor has begun shifting some of the orders to HannStar.</blockquote></p>
<p>Take anything coming out of DIGITIMES with a grain of salt. The dispute between Apple and Samsung is with Samsung Electronics. Apple procures LCDs from what is now a separate spinned off <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2012/02/14/samsung-to-spinoff-lcd-business/">Samsung Display Co</a>. Still I can understand if Apple wants to move away from sourcing components from any Samsung company, but HannStar is an interesting choice since it is one of the weaker LCD suppliers in Taiwan, after Chimei Innolux and AU Optronics.</p>
