<p>The 4G in T-Mobile myTouch 4G might initially be what gets you excited, but I think it will be the photographic capabilities that gets you hooked. But first a quick blurb about the display: a 3.7-inch 800x480 Super LCD. Pretty standard. Now the camera: an 8-megapixel image sensor coupled with a fast f/2.2 lens that should be better at capturing moments in low-light environments than most other smartphones, including the iPhone 4. The iPhone 4 packs a f/2.8 lens. Other features include burst mode, panorama and HDR.</p>
<p>The T-Mobile myTouch 4G also tops the iPhone 4 in video capture: 1080p. We all know quality isn't synonymous with pixels. The 1080p video captured by the myTouch 4G doesn't necessarily mean that it will look better than the iPhone 4's 720p video. We'll have to wait for some reviews to find out for sure.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to Apple and others upping the ante when it comes to photography. What I would like to see are: a faster lens (f/1.8), optical image stabilization, a larger image sensor without increasing the number of pixels. Fingers crossed.</p>
