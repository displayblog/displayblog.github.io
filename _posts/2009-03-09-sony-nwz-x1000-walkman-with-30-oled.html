<p><a href="http://www.sonystyle.com.hk/ss/product/walkman/nwz_x1060_e.jsp">Sony</a>: The Sony NWZ-X1000 is a Walkman touting a 3.0" OLED display with a pixel format of 432x240 in landscape orientation. For a quick comparison, Apple's iPod Touch has a 3.5" TFT LCD with a 480x320 pixel format. Though the OLED display will get you better color, I would prefer the larger LCD with more pixels. Video playback for H.264-encoded video is limited to 320x240 on the NWZ-X1000. Same goes for MPEG4 and WMV files. It's a bit puzzling: wouldn't you want to take advantage of every pixel on the display?</p>
<p>Unlike Apple where you are chained to iTunes for the most part, the OLED Walkman from Sony lets you simply drag and drop music, video and pictures into the MUSIC, VIDEO and PICTURE folders. Podcasts go in a separate folder called PODCASTS. Simple. I like it.</p>
<p>What I don't like is the granite-like chassis. Looks terrible. If you wanted to incorporate exotic materials I think it would have been better to stick with carbon fiber, magnesium, aluminum, or a combination.</p>
