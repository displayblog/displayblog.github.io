<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/8/3072368/malcolm-gladwell-bill-gates-steve-jobs-legacy">Malcolm Gladwell</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>And of the great entrepreneurs of this era, people will have forgotten Steve Jobs. Who&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Steve Jobs again?</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1167158/macalope_executive_suite.html">The Macalope</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s certainly true that Gates will be remembered for contributions other than his business acumen and frumpy sweaters. His impact on the third world is significant and, for whatever reason, Jobs eschewed personal philanthropy. But you don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have to be a philanthropist to have a legacy. Gladwell seems to want Jobs to have been something he wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t, but that doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t mean he won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be remembered for his own contributions.</blockquote></p>
<p>Gladwell seems to have gone off the deep end; an imaginary beast has more sense.</p>
