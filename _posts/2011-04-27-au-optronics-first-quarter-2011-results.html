<p><a href="http://www.auo.com/?sn=107&lang=en-US&c=11&n=1154">AUO</a>: Consolidated revenues were down 9.1% Q/Q to NT$93.23 billion with gross profits of -NT$6.27 billion. Large-area LCD panel shipments increased 1.3% Q/Q and 4.3% Y/Y to 28.4 million units. On the other hand, small/medium LCD unit shipments were down 17.8% Q/Q and 23.7% Y/Y to 43.5 million, not surprising considering the focus on smartphones and tablets.</p>
