<p>[ <a href="http://www.displaymate.com/Galaxy_S7_ShootOut_1.htm">DisplayMate</a> ] Raymond Soneira:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Galaxy S7 introduces two important display enhancements. There is a new interactive Personalized Automatic Brightness Control that learns and remembers the display brightness settings that you set for various ambient light levels so you get your own customized personal visual brightness preferences instead of some pre-programmed manufacturer settings found in other smartphones, tablets, and TVs. This not only improves the screen readability in ambient light but also the running time on battery because you'll just see the screen Brightness levels that you need. It is the first smartphone, tablet, or TV to do Automatic Brightness correctly. And there is also a new Always On Display mode that will show various personalized clock, calendar, status messages, notifications and images on the main screen whenever the phone is off (in standby), all day and all night, which can be done with very low power on an OLED, so you can always discreetly check it with just a glance. In addition, all of the Galaxy OLED displays can be used with polarized sunglasses in both the portrait and landscape orientations, unlike almost all LCDs.</p>
<p>The Galaxy S7 matches or breaks new records in Smartphone display performance for:<br />
Highest Absolute Color Accuracy (1.5 JNCD), Highest Peak Brightness (855 nits), Highest Contrast Rating in Ambient Light (186), Highest Screen Resolution (2560x1440), Highest (infinite) Contrast Ratio, and Smallest Brightness Variation with Viewing Angle (28 percent). In addition, almost every display lab test and measurement shows some improvements compared to the Galaxy S6. See the main Display Shoot-Out Comparison Table for all of the measurements and details.</blockquote></p>
<p>Automatic brightness control done right, finally. Perhaps Apple can steal this idea and update the not-as-smart algorithm that makes my iPhone too bright or not bright enough on too many occasions.</p>
<p>The always-on mode is great because you don't have to push a button just to check the time. You don't want to implement an always-on mode on LCDs because that would consume too much energy since the backlight will be always on, too. I'd like to simply glance at my phone and see the time.</p>
<p>Polarized sunglasses: I highly recommend them to you. Good quality polarized sunglasses can dramatically eliminate glare, which means your eyes are more comfortable and things you see are clearer. Just not your iPhone. I have polarized sunglasses -- my wife is an optometrist so she insisted and I am glad she did -- and when I have those on and look at my iPhone let's just say what I see isn't the prettiest thing.</p>
<p>When it comes to display technology Samsung is on top with its smartphone OLED displays, and the Galaxy S7 is the best. Looking forward to an iPhone with an OLED display. Soon?</p>
