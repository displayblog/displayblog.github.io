<p>Steve Lohr, <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/16/ibm-offers-a-data-tool-for-the-mainstream-with-watsons-help/">The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>IBM has shown an early working version of Watson Analytics to a handful of customers and industry analysts, letting them try it out, and they are generally impressed. It combines basics of data handling with the Watson technologies of natural-language processing and machine learning. A result, they say, is that a business person, who is not a statistician or data scientist, can type in questions to probe corporate data. Examples: &acirc;&euro;&oelig;What high-value customers am I most likely to close sales with in the next 30 days?&acirc;&euro; and &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Which benefits drive employee retention the most?&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>Looking forward to the day Siri and Watson start to date.</p>
