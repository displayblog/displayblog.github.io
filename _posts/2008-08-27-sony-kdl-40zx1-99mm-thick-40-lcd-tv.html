<p>9.9mm. That's 0.99cm. And again just a hair under 0.39". Wow. That is super thin. But just so you know, that 9.9mm figure is just for the top part. When you come down a bit you'll hit a bit thicker portion and that's 28mm or 1.1". That's still quite thin. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sony">Sony</a>'s KDL-40ZX1 makes use of a white <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led-backlight">LED backlight</a>, with some impressive optical films to diffuse the light coming out of the LEDs I'm sure. A contrast ratio of 3000:1, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=120hz">120Hz</a> frequency, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=bravia-engine-2">BRAVIA Engine 2</a>, 178/178 viewing angles all point to one thing: a must-have 40" LCD TV if you intend to put it up on a wall. Shame to anyone who gets the KDL-40ZX1 and simply uses the stand, wasting what is the most incredible feature: ultra thinness. But actually, the picture above looks really nice. You might want to keep it on the stand just to take a look at how thin it is from time to time. Another cool feature is the 5GHz wireless connection: you wouldn't want a whole bunch of wires coming out of the KDL-40ZX1. And that is why there is an external box for most of the AV connections.</p>
