<p>I'm having a lot of fun with macro photography <em>via</em> a loupe using my iPhone 4 and thought I'd share.</p>
<p>For quite some time I've been exploring ways to take interesting photographs with my iPhone 4. As some of you may know my iPhone 4 is my only photographic tool for both still pictures and videos. With a Lombart 10x loupe I've been fascinated by how things look up close, very close.</p>
<p>Macro photography using a loupe and your iPhone requires some steady hands: the lens on the iPhone 4 needs to be flat to the loupe, which also needs to be held steady. Since the loupe has a narrow opening the iPhone lens has to be exactly centered, unless you're looking for a vignette look.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/basic.jpg" alt="" title="basic" width="640" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20635" /></p>
<p>This was taken from Paul Allen's <em>Idea Man</em>. It's the hardback version. Look at that fibrous texture. I think my reading experience is going to be a bit more organic from now on.</p>

<p>And it's easy to take close up photos of displays. The photo above clearly shows a RGB stripe sub-pixel structure. The little smudge on the bottom is due to a smudge on the LCD; thankfully it isn't a defect.</p>
<p>There are some cases with lens attachments you can buy for your iPhone 4, but with a simple loupe and a couple of steady hands you can quickly be up and running with macro photography on your iPhone 4.</p>
