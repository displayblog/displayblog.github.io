<p>What is a great display without great content? Picking the right display is important, but finding the right image capture device&Acirc;&nbsp;is just as important, especially if it's a webcam.&Acirc;&nbsp;Next to Apple's iSight, I haven't seen that many high-quality webcams. Many have fantastic specifications but most of them end up having only decent quality. I hope this unit called HP's Elite Auto Focus Webcam doesn't disappoint.</p>
<p><em>Specifications</em><br />
Still image capture: 12MP<br />
Moving image capture: 3MP at 5-6fps, VGA at 30fps<br />
Integrated stereo microphone<br />
Privacy cover<br />
Price: $99.99<br />
Availability: April 6, 2008</p>
<p>The rest of the specs&Acirc;&nbsp;are interesting, but not essential. For instance the included software, ArcSoft Magic-i, is a tool that's similar to&Acirc;&nbsp;the one on the Mac (can't seem to remember what it is called), that gives you special effects when video conferencing.&Acirc;&nbsp;</p>
