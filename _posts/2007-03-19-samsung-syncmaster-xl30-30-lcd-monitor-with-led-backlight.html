<p>Samsung introduced its SyncMaster XL30 LCD monitor during CeBIT. The XL30 is a 30" wide LCD monitor with a LED backlight. By using LEDs instead of CCFLs, the XL30 has a color gamut of 123% NTSC, which is much better than your typical monitor with 72% and even better than those that have Wide Color Gamut CCFL (WCG-CCFL) backlights that generate 92% NTSC. I am not sure if there are any benefits to having more than 100% NTSC for video viewing. Video is generated at 100% NTSC. Of course, professionals that are in the imaging industry will welcome the XL30 as they tend to work with color triangles that are much greater than NTSC. Other features include a contrast ratio of 3,000:1 (dynamic), a response time of 2ms and viewing angles of 170/170. Gamma, color temperature and white balances can all be configured based on the user's needs. You can also choose to work in Adobe RGB or sRGB. Inputs include USB terminal, DVI-D with HDCP.</p>
<p>I would hazard to guess that LCD monitor brands such as Dell, Viewsonic, HP and other are looking forward to incorporating this LED-based LCD monitor panel from Samsung. I doubt Apple will because they generally do not use PVA panels from Samsung for their high-end monitors. Just a hunch.</p>
