<blockquote><p>Okay, there&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the normal hell of moving to a new platform &mdash; and I gotta say, Android was more hell to move to than most consoles I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve adopted. Just because of the way Google has to position things across a diverse hardware spectrum, and because Google still doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t really endorse native code development &mdash; they&acirc;&euro;&trade;d still rather everyone worked in Java. And that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a defensible position, but it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s certainly not what you want to be doing on a resource-constrained VR system.</p>
<p>So brace yourself: Android setup and development really does suck. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s no fun at all.</blockquote></p>
