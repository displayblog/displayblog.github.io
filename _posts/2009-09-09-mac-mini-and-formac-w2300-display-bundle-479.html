<p>Joe Westhead, Product Manager at Jigsaw Systems, has informed me that DisplayBlog readers can get a Mac mini and Formac's W2300 23-inch 1080p LCD monitor for just &Acirc;&pound;479 (about US$792). I believe you'll need to reside in the UK or Ireland to get this awesome deal. The 1.83GHz Mac mini comes with 1GB of RAM and a 80GB hard disk. The Formac W2300 is a 23-inch LCD monitor sporting a 1920 x 1080 resolution, 400 cd/m2 of brightness, 1000:1 contrast ratio, a 5ms response time and an anti-glare cover. Connectivity options include: DVI, VGA and a 4-port USB hub. Speakers are built-in. <a href="http://www.jigsaw24.com/default.aspx?ITEM=JIGSX450AVA">Check it out at Jigsaw24.com</a>.</p>
<p>Here is some more information about Formac's W2300 23-inch LCD monitor (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/spec/formac/Formac_W2300_Spec.pdf">you can download the product spec sheet</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Size: 23-inch TN TFT LCD Panel with Anti-glare Surface</li>
<li>Resolution: 1920 x 1080</li>
<li>Aspect Ratio: 16:9</li>
<li>Viewing Angles: 160/160</li>
<li>Brightness: 400 cd/m2</li>
<li>Contrast Ratio: 1000:1</li>
<li>Response Time: 5ms</li>
<li>Connectivity: DVI, VGA, Audio, 4-port USB Hub</li>
<li>Speakers: Two 5W</li>
<li>Power Consumption: <45W (operational)</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>So the W2300 is a 23-inch 1080p LCD monitor and Formac is targeting the casual user with an eye for design. The 160/160 viewing angles are a bit limited but standard on most TN TFT LCD panels. The W2300 is quite bright at 400 cd/m2 and the contrast ratio is a solid 1000:1--I'm guessing the number is for static contrast ratio not dynamic. Response time of 5ms is not the fastest in the world, but it is still very good. Connectivity options are DVI and VGA with a 4-port USB hub, always nice to have.</p>
