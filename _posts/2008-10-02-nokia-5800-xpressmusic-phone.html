<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/10/02/the-nokia-5800-xpressmusic/">Engadget</a>: The Nokia 5800 XpressMusic smartphone is the company's late entrance to the touch smartphone party that Apple started a while ago. The 5800 XpressMusic sports a 3.2" TFT LCD with a 640x360 pixel format, which is quite a bit. Compared to the iPhone's 480x320 the 5800 XpressMusic has got quite an upper hand when it comes to the number of pixels. Of course it isn't all about pixels; it is what you do with them. Nokia is focusing on music with its 5800.</p>
<p>The 5800 has straightforward controls: virtual buttons. It would have been nice if you could have flicked like you do on the iPhone. But the real deal breaker for display snobs is that the 5800 sports a resistive touch technology versus the capacitive touch that is in almost all other high-end smartphones. I don't know why Nokia went that route. Resistive is cheaper and it does give a more tactile feedback, but the company could have incorporated micro-motors to vibrate (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/09/26/samsung-haptic-2-touch-smartphones-sch-w550-sph-w5500-sch-w555/">Samsung's Haptic</a>).</p>
<p>The Carl Zeiss optics mated to a 3.2MP sensor should lead to very good photos. In darker situations the dual-LED flashes will certainly help. The iPhone can't touch the 5800 in this regard. The price isn't all that bad either at just 279 euros.</p>
