<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/11/16/hp-folio-13-ultrabook-official-starts-at-899-with-a-128gb-ssd/">Dana Wollman, Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the first things we noticed about the Folio is that the bezels are relatively narrow, at least compared to what you'll usually see paired with such a common 1366 x 768 display. [...] As for the viewing angles, well, look at some of our hands-on photos and decide for yourself. Our early take is that they're on par with what you'd get from other TN displays, which is to say, they're not great (but not necessarily terrible either).</blockquote></p>
<p>I think we need to be a bit more nuanced when talking about display viewing angles on notebooks. Horizontal viewing angles aren't as important. And in some cases you want horizontal viewing angles to be somewhat limited for a bit of privacy. The more important are vertical viewing angles. Not everyone flies economy and not everyone is unfortunate enough to sit behind someone who has his seat tilted back all the way all the time. But more often than not you'll be looking at your notebook at an angle that's far from ideal and that's when a LCD panel with good vertical viewing angles will come in handy. So the HP Folio 13 Ultrabook might be good enough despite the weak horizontal viewing angles.</p>
<p>But the weak pixel format of 1366x768 has got to go. The bar has been set for 13.3-inch ultrabooks by the MacBook Air and that's 1440x900. But then again the Folio 13 Ultrabook starts at just US$900.</p>
