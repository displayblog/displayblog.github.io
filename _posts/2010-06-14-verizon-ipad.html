<blockquote><p>There is one major flaw with the iPad that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s been bothering me about it since day one: AT&amp;T. As revolutionary and awesome as it is, the iPad deserves&acirc;&euro;&ldquo;and needs&acirc;&euro;&ldquo;a good internet connection, hence the reason Sprint and Verizon have been pushing the use of MiFi with the iPad.</blockquote><br />
Use the MiFi with the iPad this person did: The internals of a MiFi was fitted into the iPad. The result is the Verizon iPad. Excellent.</p>
