<p>Supplies are limited. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=walmart">Walmart</a> did mention that they did purchase quite a bit, but at this price even a plentiful supply can run out quickly. The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=toshiba">Toshiba</a> A205-S500 will be in Walmart's Sunday circular as well. The A205 sports an industry standard (and most popular) 15.4" wide TFT LCD with a pixel format of 1280 x 800.</p>
<p>Notebook Reviews gave it a whirl and came out with this conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p>All of the key components are protected very well, including the display which can easily be the most expensive part to repair if damaged. Performance on this specific configuration was more than acceptable for my needs, but would not be able to even consider any serious gaming. A great use I found for this laptop was a portable media station, playing much of my HD content with ease, as well as having plenty of storage for the large files.</blockquote><br />
But the review model had 250GB of HDD capacity. The Walmart special is 120GB, not small, but not as big as 250GB.</p>
