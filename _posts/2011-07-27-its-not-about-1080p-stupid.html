<p>EA CEO <a href="http://www.industrygamers.com/news/ea-ceo-consoles-now-only-40-of-games-industry/">John Riccitiello</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think there&acirc;&euro;&trade;s going to be an interesting debate when you get to processing power beyond what you can push up with a 1080p or a 720p [system]. Most people squint between 1080p and 720p, because what&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the difference, seriously?</blockquote><br />
Like Riccitiello said, most won't be able to tell the difference between the two <em>if</em> sitting at an optimum distance from the display. But if you sit closer, you'll be able to tell the two apart.&Acirc;&nbsp;It's not about 720p versus 1080p; it's about what our eyes can see.&Acirc;&nbsp;As long as there's a resolution gap between our eyes and the displays we use, graphics and display technology will continue to improve.</p>
