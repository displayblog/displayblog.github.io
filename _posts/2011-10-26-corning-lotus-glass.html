<p><a href="http://www.corning.com/displaytechnologies/en/news_center/news_releases/2011/2011102501.aspx">Corning</a>: Lotus Glass by Corning takes advantage of rapid growth in low-temperature poly-silicon (LTPS) and the great potential for oxide thin-film transistor (TFT) backplanes. LTPS backplanes enable high-performance mobile displays like the Retina Display in the iPhone 4/4S. Corning Lotus Glass has a high annealing point, meaning it maintains dimensional stability during high temperature manufacturing processes, which are much higher in LTPS than in amorphous silicon (a-Si). Tighter design rules can be applied to LTPS and oxide TFT backplanes for more rapid response times and higher resolution.</p>
