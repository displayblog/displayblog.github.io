<p><a href="http://dot-color.com/2012/08/14/color-space-confusion/">Jeff Yurek, dot color</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was not until 1976 that the CIE was able to settle on a significantly more linear color space. If we reproduce MacAdam&acirc;&euro;&trade;s work using the new standard, variations in percieve color are minimalized and the MacAdam&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Elipses mapped on a 1976 CIE diagram appear much more evenly sized and circular, as opposed to oblong. This makes color comparisons using CIE 1976 significantly more meaningful.</blockquote></p>
