<p><a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/06/21/needham-androids-market-share-peaked-in-march/">CNNMoney</a>: According to IDC, Apple's share of the U.S. smartphone market share increased 12.3 percentage points to 29.5% in the first quarter of 2011. Android's share on the other hand dropped from 52.4% to 49.5%. Needham's Charlie Wolf:</p>
<blockquote><p>In our opinion, this is just the beginning of Android's share loss in the U.S. The migration of subscribers to the iPhone on the Verizon network should accelerate this fall when Apple coordinates the launch of iPhone 5 on the GSM and CDMA networks. The iPhone could also launch on the Sprint and T-Mobile networks.</blockquote></p>
