<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2010/11/windows-phone-7-updates-can-carriers-block-them.ars">Ars Technica</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>OTA updates are out, apparently... Maybe not forever, but, citing a desire to be consistent and reliable, as well as the ability to make a full phone backup when tethered, the current operating system will only support USB updates.</p>
<p>... carriers will, in fact, be able to hold back updates to some extent.</blockquote></p>
<p>Joe Belfiore confirms via <a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/mobile/wp7_03.asp">Paul Thurrott's SuperSite for Windows</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Carriers could in fact block updates to sell you a phone.</blockquote></p>
<p>No OTA updates. Updates can be blocked by carriers. That doesn't sound good at all.</p>
