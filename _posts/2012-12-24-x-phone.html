<p>Amir Efrati, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB10001424127887324731304578191711598368942-lMyQjAxMTAyMDIwMTEyNDEyWj.html">The Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Motorola also ran into difficulties when it looked into using a bendable screen and materials such as ceramics that would allow the company to make the X Phone more stress resistant, use more colors and mold into different shapes, these people said.</blockquote></p>
<p>We do want more rugged phones out of the box, and without having to protect them with ugly cases. But a bendable screen? I think that's the wrong approach. A bendable screen is easier said than done. Assuming a candybar design where the display is integrated into the chassis, a bendable display suggests a bendable chassis. Not impossible, but cost effectively mass manufacturing millions of bendable electronics are a ways off. A better approach would be to focus more on incremental innovations such as a cover glass-integrated display or waterproofing without making it ugly*.</p>
<p>* Something the Japanese have enjoyed for quite some time with smartphones like the <a href="http://smartphones.panasonic.eu/en/">Eluga by Panasonic</a>.</p>
