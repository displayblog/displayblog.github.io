<p><a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2010/09/13/did-apple-acquire-imsense-ltd-for-hdr-capabilities-in-ios-4-1/">MacRumors</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>imsense, a spin-off from the University of East Anglia, has developed a technology known as "eye-fidelity" for producing nearly instantaneous Dynamic Range Correction in both standard and HDR photos using software algorithms to remap image tones in order to recover details lost in underexposed or overexposed regions of photos while maintaining color balance and generating final images as close to that perceived by the eye in reality as possible.</p>
<p>While the iPhone 4's camera does generate true HDR images by combining three separate exposures into a single image, technology like eye-fidelity can help the HDR process maintain a realistic appearance for the final photos.<br />
