<p><a href="http://www.displaysearch.com/cps/rde/xchg/displaysearch/hs.xsl/120104_mobile_pc_outlook_shows_growing_influence_of_tablet_pcs.asp">NPD DisplaySearch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The tablet PC category expanded its role in the mobile PC market, with shipments of 72.7 million units, accounting for 25.5% of mobile PC shipments in 2011, according to the latest NPD DisplaySearch <a href="http://www.displaysearch.com/cps/rde/xchg/displaysearch/hs.xsl/quarterly_mobile_pc_shipment_and_forecast_report.asp">Quarterly Mobile PC Shipment and Forecast Report</a>. The Y/Y shipment growth rate for tablets in 2011 is expected to reach 256%, as strong tablet shipments in Q3&acirc;&euro;&trade;11 appeared to be a prelude to equally vigorous demand in Q4&acirc;&euro;&trade;11. Introductions of significantly competitive new devices in Q4&acirc;&euro;&trade;11, strong demand for incumbents, and additional distribution channels have been catalysts for accelerated tablet PC shipment growth.</blockquote></p>
<p>Take these results <em>cum grano salis</em>. Shipments? Who cares about shipments? Shipments into the channel without inventory numbers to go along with them is almost meaningless. A good example would be high shipment numbers for RIM's BlackBerry PlayBook and absolutely dismal sales to actual customers. At US$299 PlayBooks in the channel will finally be cleared out in Q1'12. And how does NPD DisplaySearch know how many iPads Apple <em>shipped</em> if only those sold are made public? The difference between shipped (into the channel) and sold (to the customer who will use it) is inventory, and it's a critically important bit of information.</p>
