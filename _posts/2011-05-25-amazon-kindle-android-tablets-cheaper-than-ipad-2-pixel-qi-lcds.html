<p><a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/amazons-android-based-kindle-tablets-will-both-be-cheaper-than-499-ipad-2/96749">Cult of Mac</a>: The 7-inch Kindle Android tablet codenamed Coyote will be priced at US$349 and equipped with an NVIDIA Tegra 2 CPU. The larger 10-inch Hollywood version will come with a $449 sticker and powered by a quad-core NVIDIA Tegra T30 "Kal-El" SoC (system-on-chip).</p>
<p>This might be coincidence but <a href="http://pixelqi.com/blog1/2011/05/19/pixel-qi-launches-new-displays-at-computex/">Pixel Qi just announced that it will be showcasing two new displays at Computex</a>: a 7-inch 1024x600 and a 10-inch 1280x800 LCD. These two LCDs sport power savings of up to 80% compared to conventional LCDs by completely shutting off the backlight in reflective mode and allowing sunlight readability. I think this is just the ticket to give the iPad 2 some serious competition.</p>
