<p><img src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Samsung_Resin_LCD_10inch_Galaxy_Tab.jpg" alt="" title="Samsung_Resin_LCD_10inch_Galaxy_Tab" width="480" height="539" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14151" /></p>
<p><a href="http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20101110/187287/">TechOn</a>: Samsung is showing off a 10.1-inch prototype device at the FPD International Green Device 2010 show in China. The 10.1-inch LCD is special. Instead of using glass substrates Samsung looked to resin.</p>
<p>The glass used in mobile devices like the Samsung Galaxy Tab is 0.5mm; resin is much thinner at 0.09mm. That results in thinner LCD panels: 1.26mm for glass-based and just 0.44mm for resin-based.</p>
<p>The big thing is weight, which is drastically reduced from 130g to just 28g for the LCD panel without the backlight.</p>
<p>The photo looks just like a 10-inch Samsung Galaxy Tab. Although the pixel format of the demonstration was 1024x600 there is a good chance that it will increase quite a bit when it comes out.</p>
