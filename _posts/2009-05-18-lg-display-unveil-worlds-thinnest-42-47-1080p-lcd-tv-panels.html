<p><em>Update</em> Here is some updated information about the world's thinnest 42-inch and 47-inch LCD TV panels: Viewing angles are 178/178; the LCD panel is 10-bit; and brightness is 450 cd/m2. Power consumption is 110W for the 42-inch model and 130W for the 47-inch. Availability is undecided at the moment.</p>
<p><em>Original Post</em></p>
<p><strong>World's Thinnest</strong> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22lg+display%22&amp;sa=Search#1585">LG Display</a> announced on May 19, 2009 the world's thinnest 42-inch and 47-inch 1080p LCD TV panels making use of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=edge-lit+led+backlight&amp;sa=Search#1664">edge-lit LED backlight</a>s. The LCD panels are just 5.9mm thick (0.23-inch). LG Display also incorporated the company's proprietary LGS (Light Guide Sheet) technology that reduced thickness by half compared to typical LGPs (light guide plates).</p>
<p><strong>Light</strong> The world's thinnest 42-inch and 47-inch LCD TV panels are also very light at just 6.1kg (13.42lbs) and 7.3kg (16.06lbs) respectively. These are roughly 1/2 the weight of typical LCD TVs that employ CCFL backlights.</p>
<p><strong>Performance</strong> The color gamut has improved from a standard 72% NTSC to 80%. LG Display also incorporated <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=120hz&amp;sa=Search#1542">120Hz</a> technology to reduce motion blur and clocks in at a motion picture response time (MPRT) of just 8ms.</p>
<p>LCD TVs of the future will be thinner, lighter, consumer less power, better color gamuts, and very decent front screen performance. What is missing here is local dimming but I hear that <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/02/27/edge-lit-led-backlight-with-local-dimming-eta-2010/">companies are working on pairing that with edge-lit LED backlighting</a>.</p>
