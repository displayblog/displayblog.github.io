<p><a href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/online_mobile/report-how-americans-are-spending-their-media-time-and-money/">Nielsen</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Though less than 5 percent of TV households, homes with broadband Internet and free, broadcast TV are on the rise&mdash;growing 22.8 percent over last year. These households are also found to exhibit interesting video behaviors: they stream video twice as much as the general population and watch half as much TV.</blockquote></p>
<p>I wonder what percentage of households don't have any connection to broadcast TV, free or paid. That's our home. Although I enjoy a show or two on Hulu I've recently noticed there seems to be quite a bit more commercial breaks than before. I hate stupid commercials and to get completely away from them the only way is to buy TV shows. But if they're expensive I'll be forced to give up on TV shows altogether; that might be a very good thing.</p>
