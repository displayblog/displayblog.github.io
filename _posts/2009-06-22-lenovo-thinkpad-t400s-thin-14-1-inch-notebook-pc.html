<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=lenovo&amp;sa=Search">Lenovo</a>'s <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=thinkpad&amp;sa=Search">ThinkPad</a> T400s is a 14.1-inch notebook PC that is just 0.83-inch thick and includes an optical drive: DVD burner or Blu-ray player. A couple of notables: the delete and escape keys have been enlarged. According to David Hill, a Lenovo designer responsible for the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=x300&amp;sa=Search">X300</a> and the T400s, we use the delete key about 700 times per week. I guess we make a lot of mistakes! The good folks at Lenovo also built in mute buttons for the mic and speakers making it more convenient for those that use VoIP. But more importantly, I'm wondering about the 14.1-inch LCD.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Lenovo states that it has a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=led+backlight&amp;sa=Search">LED backlight</a> but not much else. In my opinion, even more important than the backspace, escape keys and mute buttons is the LCD. No matter what we're doing we're staring into the LCD as long as we're on the computer. The LCD doesn't have to be professional-caliber since most T400s users will be using Office applications instead of PhotoShop, but I hope the LCD is not of the crappy kind. Want more effective presentations? Make colors pop and viewable at an angle! To do that you'll need a decent LCD. I now expect <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/06/10/notebook-pcs-getting-better-lcds/">better LCDs in notebook PCs</a>. Do you? You should.</p></p>
