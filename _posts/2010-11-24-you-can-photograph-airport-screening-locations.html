<p>Robert Graham at <a href="http://erratasec.blogspot.com/2010/11/i-was-just-detained-by-tsa.html">Errata Security</a> was detained by the TSA while taking photographs of the airport screening locations. They were acting like the government of Kuwait. That was a waste of time and tax dollars since taking photographs of airport screening locations is perfectly legitimate. Here is section 2.7A of the 2008 TSA Screening Manual:</p>
<blockquote><p>2.7. PHOTOGRAPHING, VIDEOTAPING, AND FILMING SCREENING LOCATIONS<br />
A. TSA does not prohibit the public, passengers, or press from photographing, videotaping, or filming screening locations unless the activity interferes with a TSO&acirc;&euro;&trade;s ability to perform his or her duties or prevents the orderly flow of individuals through the screening location. Requests by commercial entities to photograph an airport screening location must be forwarded to TSA&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Office of Strategic Communications and Public Affairs. Photographing EDS or ETD monitor screens or emitted images is not permitted.<br />
B. TSA must not confiscate or destroy the photographic equipment or film of any person photographing the screening location.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.tsa.gov/2009/03/can-i-take-photos-at-checkpoint-and.html">The TSA Blog</a> is also clear that photographing as well as videotaping is not prohibited:</p>
<blockquote><p>We don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t prohibit public, passengers or press from photographing, videotaping, or filming at screening locations. You can take pictures at our checkpoints as long as you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re not interfering with the screening process or slowing things down. We also ask that you do not film or take pictures of our monitors.</blockquote></p>
<p>So go ahead and take pictures and videos of airport screening locations but make sure to keep away from actual displays.</p>
