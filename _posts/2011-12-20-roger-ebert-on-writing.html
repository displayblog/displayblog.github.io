<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/09/roger-ebert-on-writing-15-reflections-from-life-itself/245408/#slide2">The Atlantic</a>. From his book <em>Life Itself</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I write, I fall into the zone many writers, painters, musicians, athletes, and craftsmen of all sorts seem to share: In doing something I enjoy and am expert at, deliberate thoughts fall aside and it is all just there. I think of the next word no more than the composer thinks of the next note.</blockquote></p>
<p>One more:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most people choose to write a blog. I needed to. I didn't intend for it to drift into autobiography, but in blogging there is a tidal drift that pushes you that way. Getting such quick feedback may be one reason; the Internet encourages first-person writing, and I've always written that way. How can a movie review be written in the third person, as if it were an account of the facts? If it isn't subjective, there's something false about it.</blockquote></p>
