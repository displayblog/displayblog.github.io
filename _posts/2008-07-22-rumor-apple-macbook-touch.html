<p><a href="http://www.macdailynews.com/index.php/weblog/comments/rumor_apples_secret_product_is_macbook_touch/">MacDailyNews</a>: The rumor is that a Mac tablet is in the works, a MacBook touch. The renderings in the picture above looks pretty good, but the UI will need to be dramatically changed so that it is more finger friendly. I would guess the UI to be between that of the iPhone's and the traditional OS X GUI. Steve Jobs did mention that Apple is working on some new products during <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/07/21results.html">Apple's conference call that was held July 21, 2008</a>. "...we're busy finishing several more wonderful new products to launch in the coming months," is exactly what Steve shared. Hopefully there will be a refresh to the MacBook, MacBook Pro and the Cinema displays.</p>
