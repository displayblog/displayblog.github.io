<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-28/motorola-profit-tops-estimates-on-rising-sales-of-droid-phones.html">Bloomberg</a>: Motorola sold US$2 billion worth of handsets in the third quarter. Operating profits were $3 million. Of those handsets Motorola sold 3.8 million smartphones. Let's assume for the sake of argument that all phones sold last quarter by Motorola were smartphones. I'm being very generous here. Motorola made about 79 cents per smartphone. Hmm...</p>
