<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-11133 aligncenter" title="Toshiba_Libretto_W100_Dual_7inch_Touch_LCD_UMPC_02" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Toshiba_Libretto_W100_Dual_7inch_Touch_LCD_UMPC_02.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="590" /></p>Oooh, Toshiba's got something very interesting. The company's Libretto W100 UMPC sports <em>two</em> 7-inch LCDs. One works as a display and the other works as a multitouch glass keyboard. Of course you could use it as a dual-page e-book reader in portrait mode. What's the occasion? Twenty five years in the notebook business. Each of the 7-inch LED-backlit LCD features a 1024x600 pixel format and both are touch capable. Toshiba considers it a concept PC but plans to manufacture a limited number for US$1,099. Within the next few months at the end of August, in Japan. I do hope Toshiba realizes there will be considerable demand internationally.
