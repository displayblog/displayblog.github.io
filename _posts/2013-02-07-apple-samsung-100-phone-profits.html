<p>Shara Tibken, <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57567891-94/apple-samsung-gobble-all-2012-handset-profits-and-then-some/">c|net</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As far as industry profits go, Apple likely had 72 percent share in the period, up sequentially from 59 percent, Walkley said.</blockquote></p>
<p>Samsung took in 29% of industry profits in Q4'12 and 34% for 2012, according to Canaccord Genuity.</p>
<p>* Weird. The two combined is more than 100%, possibly due to rounding up decimals.</p>
