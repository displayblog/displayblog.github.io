<p><a href="http://9xmedia.com/products/displays/index.php">9x Media</a>: The X-Top Scalable Multi-Screen Display System made its debut in 2001 at the Siggraph conference in Los Angeles, California. The X-Top system easily accommodates 19-inch to 32-inch LCDs in landscape, portrait or mixed.</p>

<p>X-Top 30-screen triple row scalable ergonomic Multi-Monitor display solution. This is available with customized Multi-screen servers. If this multi-monitor system can integrate thirty 30-inch LCD monitors with a pixel format of 2560x1600, that would mean a total pixel format of 25600x4800 leading to the number of pixels at 122,880,000 or 122.88MP!!! You'd have absolutely zero problems putting up any digital picture taken by any digital camera.</p>

<p>This is probably more realistic for someone like me: three 24-inch LCD monitors. That's 1920x1200 times three with a grand total of 5760 x 1200. How much damage? $7570.50 before shipping and handling! I'd rather get five 30-inch Apple Cinema HD displays for slightly less and a whole lot more pixels: 12800x1600.</p>
