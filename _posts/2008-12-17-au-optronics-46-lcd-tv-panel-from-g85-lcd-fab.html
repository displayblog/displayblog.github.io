<p>AUO's G8.5 LCD fab is an interesting fab in that it also houses a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=g7.5">G7.5</a> LCD fab. AUO calls it a hybrid fab. The G7.5 LCD fab can process 1950 x 2250mm motherglass sizes with a monthly input capacity of 60K. Eight 46" LCD TV panels from a single motherglass will have a material impact on the large LCD TV market and will bring down the price of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=46"-lcd-tv">46" LCD TV</a> panels. In all likelihood, AUO will opt to manufacture six <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=55"-lcd-tv">55" LCD TV</a> panels instead of 52". By the second half of 2010 the standard size might have jumped from 40"-class to 50"-class LCD TVs. Considering that <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/12/01/vizio-vf550xvt-55-1080p-lcd-tv-for-199999/">Vizio is planning to introduce a 55" LCD TV for under $2000 next month</a>, that scenario is very likely.</p>
