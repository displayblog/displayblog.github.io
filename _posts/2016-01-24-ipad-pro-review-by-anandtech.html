<p>[ <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/9766/the-apple-ipad-pro-review/8">AnandTech</a> ] Joshua Ho, Brandon Chester, and Ryan Smith:</p>
<blockquote><p>The panel itself also appears to have dual domain pixels and a conventional RGB stripe. Viewing angles as a result are quite good. The cover glass also contains the AR coating first introduced with the iPad Air 2, which cuts reflectance roughly in half relative to a display that doesn&rsquo;t have such a coating. This effectively doubles outdoor contrast, so it&rsquo;s great for outdoor use.</blockquote></p>
<p>You want a display to have as little reflectance as possible. Here are some test results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brightness: 426.71 nits (max). The iPad Pro came in the middle of the pack, with the iPhone 6s Plus at #1 with 582.01, and just ahead of the iPad Air 2 at 406.99.<br />
</li></p>
<li>Black Levels: 0.25 nits. The iPad Pro was #1 followed by NVIDIA's SHIELD (0.29) and Microsoft's Surface Pro 4 (0.30).<br />
</li></p>
<li>Contrast Ratio: 1,644. The iPad Pro was #1 followed by Huawei Mate 8 (1,607) and iPhone 6s (1,532).<br />
</li></p>
<li>White Point: 6,908K. 6500K is optimal. The Google Nexus 5X (6,541K) and Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 (6,466K) were the closest.<br />
</li></p>
<li>Grayscale Accuracy: 1.80 (average DeltaE 2000). The iPad Pro came behind the iPad mini 4 (1.02), Google Nexus 5X (1.38), and Surface Pro 4 (1.80).<br />
</li></p>
<li>Saturation Accuracy: 1.37 (average DeltaE 2000). Similar to grayscale accuracy, the iPad Pro came in at #4 behind the iPad mini 4 (0.87), Surface Pro 4 (1.34), and Google Nexus 5X (1.35).<br />
</li></p>
<li>Gretag MacBeth (GMB) Accuracy: 1.55 (average DeltaE 2000). Second only to the iPad mini 4 (1.32), with the Surface Pro 4 (1.56) and Google Nexus 5X (1.65) right behind.<br />
</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>AnandTech concludes by stating the iPad Pro display as "one of the best available on the market today."</p>
