<p><a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2011/03/15/apples-video-store-nowhere-near-success-of-netflix-streaming/">CrunchGear</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Recent market research from the NPD group shows that Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s iTunes video delivery is in a three-way tie for third place at only 4% market share, while Netflix is way ahead at 61% and Comcast is second at 8%.</blockquote></p>
<p>I don't trust market research. Precisely because I was a market research analyst for a few years. Just keep your eyes open and read everything with a grain of salt. So, NetFlix streaming probably is leading, but I doubt it is dominating like NPD has reported.</p>
<p>We know that at the end of 2010 the number of Apple TV boxes hit one million. Contrast that to 20 million NetFlix subscribers at the end of last year with a little more than a third of new subscribers paying for streaming-only. NetFlix added 7.7 million new subscribers in 2010 with a stream-only option that started in November. That's a monthly rate of 640 thousand new subscribers. Assuming 30 to 40% of NetFlix subscribers stream, the total number of streaming subscribers are between 6 to 8 million.</p>
<p>If NetFlix has a 61% market share that would put Apple TV at 7.6 to 10.2%. If Apple TV's share is accurate at 4% then NetFlix is around 24 to 32%. For NetFlix to have a market share that's more than 15 times larger than Apple TV's the percentage of NetFlix subscribers who stream will need to be 75%. Too high in my opinion.</p>
