<p>Fuji Photo Film manufactures 80% of the world's supply of triacelyl cellulose (TAC) film that protects the polarizing films of LCDs. The company will build two new TAC factories by investing 70 billion yen that would double its capacity by August 2008. It seems Fuji Photo Film has a very positive outlook on TAC film demand and has every evidence to support it. Although LCD monitors have basically taken over the monitor market, continued growth in NBPCs, LCD TVs, and mobile phones will generate enough demand for anyone with a vested interest in Fuji Photo Film to be happy.</p>
