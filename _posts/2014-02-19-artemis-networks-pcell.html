<p><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-02-18/steve-perlmans-amazing-wireless-machine-is-finally-here">Ashlee Vance, Businessweek</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In demonstrations at his laboratory, Perlman showed off iPhones, Surface tablets, and TVs streaming massive files &mdash; the 4K UltraHD version of <em>House of Cards</em> from Netflix, for example &mdash; via his own wireless networking equipment. The demonstration proved not only that the high-speed wireless technology worked but also that it would work with existing devices that support LTE.</blockquote></p>

This is looking good: <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/02/19/google-fiber-coming-to-san-jose-california/">Google Fiber</a> at home and Artemis pCell while away. I wonder how much it'll cost...</p>
