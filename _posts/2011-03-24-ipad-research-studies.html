<p>Brian Chen at <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/03/ipad-usage/">Wired</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Indeed, it turns out that a tablet needn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t do everything that a more powerful PC can, according to multiple research studies on iPad usage. Rather, the tablet&acirc;&euro;&trade;s main appeal lies in the approachable touchscreen interface that just about anybody at any age can pick up and figure out.</blockquote></p>
<p>I think there have been many smart people who have already written much about what I am about to say, but I will say it again since large organizations like Wired still don't seem to get it. It is not just the approachable touchscreen interface. It is the hardware, the UI, the software, the App Store, and every little detail that no one else thinks about but Apple all combined that makes the iPad an iPad. Forget research studies. Just give an iPad to a two-year old, and watch.</p>
