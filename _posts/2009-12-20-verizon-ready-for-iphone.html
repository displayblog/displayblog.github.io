<p><a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2009/12/18/verizon-claims-network-ready-for-iphone-should-apple-choose-to-strike-deal/">MacRumors</a>: According to Verizon, its networks are ready for the iPhone if Apple so chooses to bring it to the most reliable network in the US. According to Anthony Melone, Verizon Wireless Chief Technology Officer at Verizon Wireless, the company has made more upgrades to its network making it capable of handling extra traffic from the iPhone:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have put things in place already. We are prepared to support that traffic.</blockquote></p>
<p>Well, it'll be a long shot since the iPhone works on GSM. Of course, the next iPhone could work on both GSM and CDMA (read <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/11/30/qualcomm-in-talks-with-apple/"><em>Qualcomm in Talks with Apple</em></a>).</p>
