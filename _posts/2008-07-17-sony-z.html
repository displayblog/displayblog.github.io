The display is a new 16:9 aspect ratio <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=13.1"">13.1"</a> TFT LCD with a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led-backlight">LED backlight</a>. The LED backlight allows for thinner designs, lower power consumption and increased durability. The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1600-x-900">1600 x 900</a> pushes the envelope in terms of pixel format. The fonts will most likely be quite small right out of the box, but when it comes to watching HD content, the aspect ratio is right at 16:9. The problem is that most HD content is formatted either at <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1280-x-800">1280 x 720</a> or <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a>. The 1600 x 900 pixel format will require scaling HD content to fit it. Scaling always deteriorates the quality, but hopefully Sony has figured out to display HD content on the Z without bringing down the quality too much.</p>

<p>Another cool feature is the ability to add two 64GB <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=ssd">SSD</a>s for a total of 128GB. This option is very expensive, but for those who need ultimate durability and performance this option is a must. I can only imagine how fast it would be in RAID 0. Of course for increased reliability the two should be configurable as RAID 1.</p>
<p>Although not as slim as <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=apple">Apple</a>'s <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=macbook-air">MacBook Air</a>, the Z has a complete list of ports and connectivity options so you will not need to lug around a set of cables as you would with the MBA. The starting price of $1799.99 is not cheap, but for what you get, it is a solid value.</p>
