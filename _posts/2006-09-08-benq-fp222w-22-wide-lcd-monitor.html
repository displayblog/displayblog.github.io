<p>BenQ's new FP222W is the fifth in its wide LCD monitor lineup that consists of 17", 19", 20" and 24" sizes. The FP222W should be available as the <a href="http://benq.com/press/News.cfm?id=1516&amp;cat=0">press release</a> stated it would be in early September. The FP222W features 1680 x 1050 (WSXGA+) resolution with a contrast ratio of 700:1, brightness of 300 cd/m2, and a response time of 5ms. There is a DVI and D-sub (PC) input.</p>

<p>Other brands such as Acer (<a href="http://displayblog.wordpress.com/2006/07/30/acer-al2216w-22-wide-lcd-monitor/">AL2216W</a>), Viewsonic and Samsung (<a href="http://displayblog.wordpress.com/2006/07/27/samsung-cx223bw-22-wide-lcd-monitor/">CX223B</a>) have introduced 22" wide LCD monitors earlier in the year. Due to cost efficient production of 22" wide LCD panels, the cost gap between 20" and 22" wide LCD monitors will decrease in the near future. Plus, as mentioned in the Samsung CX223B blog entry, by using TN+Film instead of a more expensive wide viewing angle technology such as IPS or VA, the 22" wide LCD monitor segment will come very close to 20" wide prices and very soon. Although I would prefer substantially more resolution at 1920 x 1200 by going up a single inch, the price might be a more important factor for most, and especially for the panel makers.</p>
