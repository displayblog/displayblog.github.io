<p>WALTOP's Interactive White Board has a display size of 75" and enables writing Chinese characters with a wireless pen with 1024 levels of sensitivity, a must for good calligraphy. When I was very young my grandfather taught me how to write Chinese characters. I used a traditional brush and ink. The ink was ground from a bar and took a good long while to get enough for use with a brush. One of the most important factors of writing well was to keep my wrist off of the paper. It took a lot of concentration to keep a steady arm. I wonder how my grandfather would have reacted to WALTOP's Interactive White Board with the Chinese character practice software application!</p>
