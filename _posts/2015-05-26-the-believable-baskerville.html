<blockquote><p>In a way, typefaces are the graphic equivalent of the human voice, and each voice has a specific timbre and accent. In my mind, Baskerville speaks with a calm, confidence-inspiring English accent, sort of like Colin Firth. No wonder it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s so trustworthy.</blockquote></p>
<p>I don't remember names well, so I had to look up <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000147/">Colin Firth</a>. As soon as I saw his face I remembered: he was one of the main characters in Kingsman, a decent but less serious James Bond-like action flick.</p>
<p>Back to typefaces. Baskerville is like Firth's voice? Somewhat convincing, but to me the more believable voice is The Matrix's Morpheus.</p>
