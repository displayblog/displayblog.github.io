<p>Regarding 3DTV this is what <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5698534/how-to-buy-an-hdtv">Gizmodo</a> says:</p>
<blockquote><p>3D sets are, generally speaking, the best performing sets in the product line. So even if you never intend to watch a single piece of 3D content, it's worth considering a 3DTV.</blockquote></p>
<p>Save your hard-earned cash and stay away from 3D. There's isn't that much 3D content to watch anyway. Plus your eyes and brain already process 3D in those 2D movies.</p>
<p>Regarding the Plasma vs. LCD question: If you don't mind paying a bit more in electricity bills stick with plasma. And in particular a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dpanasonic%2520plasma%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&tag=displ0f-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957">Panasonic plasma</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=displ0f-20&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, which packs Pioneer's KURO technology and gives you darker blacks and faster refresh. The only LCDs that can get you equivalent performance are the ones with full LED backlights and local dimming and they cost you a bundle.</p>

<p>1080p?</p>
<blockquote><p>So if you're sitting more than six feet away from your TV&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;or just buying a smaller set&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;considering saving some cash by going 720p. You literally won't be able to tell the difference.</blockquote></p>
<p>It really doesn't matter where you're sitting, a TV with 1920x1080 is a must especially if you intend to hook up a PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Blu-ray or anyone of the new TV boxes that let you play 1080p content. If your TV is smaller, then you can also use it as your monitor and you'll need those extra pixels.</p>

<p>We all know why Apple chooses IPS LCDs. IPS has the best viewing angles and accurate colors. That's the same with TVs. If you're dead set on a LCD then get one with IPS. Those tend to be TVs from LG and Hitachi. If you're getting a plasma, go for a Panasonic.</p>
<p>Here are my recommendations (the links are to Amazon):</p>
