<p><a href="http://racked.com/archives/2013/12/09/inside-amazon-fashions-new-brooklyn-photo-studio.php">Chavie Lieber, Racked National</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>With the studio, the company's overall objective is to give their inventory a more glossy, less stock photography-feel. On average, over 19,000 images a day are shot at the studio, and some 2,400 of those are featured on the Amazon sites.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;In fashion ecommerce, high quality imagery isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t just &acirc;&euro;&tilde;nice to have,&acirc;&euro;&trade; it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s essential. It defines the total experience. Our editorial inspires the customer, and our product pages&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the way we show how clothes fit and move&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;are our virtual sales associates. Using live models helps show the movement and flow of a garment in a way that is often difficult to replicate with mannequins alone,&acirc;&euro;¬ù Beaudoin added.</blockquote></p>
<p>High quality imagery is not only essential to fashion e-commerce but also to high-tech e-commerce. Would like to see Amazon add high quality videos, too.</p>
