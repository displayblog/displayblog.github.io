<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/why-theres-iphone/">Apple</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>The fact that there are over a million and a half capable, beautiful, inspiring apps on the App Store. And each and every one was reviewed and approved by a team of real live humans. With great taste. And great suggestions. And great ideas.</blockquote></p>
<p>And here's <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/07/24/great-great-great">John Gruber</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What irks here, fundamentally, is that Apple is <em>taking</em> credit for the great apps in the App Store, rather than <em>giving</em> credit to the third-party developers who make them.</blockquote></p>
