Dell's Streak is a sexy 5-inch Android-based tablet headed to AT&amp;T. The 5-inch LCD sports a 800x480 pixel format and is protected by Corning's <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?s=%22gorilla+glass%22">Gorilla Glass</a>. The Streak is powered by a 1GHz Snapdragon, sports a 5 megapixel camera and a front-facing 640x480 camera, and comes with Bluetooth 2.1+EDR (a bit of a disappointment since Bluetooth 3.0 is already out). Connectivity is broad: UMTS 2100/1900/850MHz, GSM/EDGE 1900/1800/900/850MHz and HSDPA 7.2Mbps / HSUPA 5.76Mbps. The US packaging with its clear acrylic case is a looker too. More information about the specs can be found at <a href="http://en.community.dell.com/dell-blogs/b/direct2dell/archive/2010/05/25/dell-streak-the-versatile-5-inch-android-tablet.aspx">Dell</a>.</p>
