<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/05/09/hp-apple-laptop-design-similarity/">HP VP of Industrial Design, Stacy Wolff</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The thing is that you have to design what's right, and that is that sometimes the wedge is the right solution, silver is the right solution. I see a lot of differences as much as the similarities. I think anybody that's close enough to the business sees that there are differences in the design. Ours is rubber-coated at the bottom. We use magnesium; they didn't do that -- they use CNC aluminum. We did a brush pattern on our product; they didn't. We did a different kind of keyboard execution. We did audio as a component; they didn't. So there are a lot of things I can list off that are differences; but if you want to look at a macro level, there are a lot of similarities to everything in the market that's an Ultrabook today. It is not because those guys did it first; it's just that's where the form factor is leading it.</blockquote></p>
<p>The MacBook Air defined a new category of notebooks, which was later coined ultrabook by the rest of the industry. Before the MBA ultraportable notebook PCs sported a variety of designs. After the MBA the name changed to ultrabook and according to Wolff all ultrabooks will inevitably look something like the MBA; the form factor dictates it. I agree with Wolff because what ultimately is an ultrabook? It's just a silly name for the MBA not made by Apple.</p>
