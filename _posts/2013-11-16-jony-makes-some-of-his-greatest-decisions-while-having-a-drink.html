<p>More from <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/business/2013/11/jony-ive-marc-newson-design-auction">Paul Goldberger, Vanity Fair</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When the deal seemed like it might founder, Ive was dispatched in person to take the prototype black-red iPod to Bono at his home in Dublin. The two men went drinking in a pub and sorted out the remaining issues in the deal. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Jony makes some of his greatest decisions while having a drink,&acirc;&euro;¬ù Bono said to me over the phone, speaking from his home in France.</blockquote></p>
<p>I wonder what Jony likes to drink...</p>
