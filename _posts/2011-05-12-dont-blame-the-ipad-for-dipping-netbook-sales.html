<p>Stephen Baker, VP of industry analysis at NPD Group <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2011/05/12/npd-dont-blame-the-ipad-for-dipping-pc-sales/">CrunchGear</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The explosion of computer sales when Windows 7 launched, as well as the huge increase in netbook sales at that time, are much more to blame for weak consumer PC sales growth than the iPad. Overall it appears that the vast majority of iPad purchases to-date have been incremental to the consumer technology industry.</blockquote></p>
<p>So iPads are not eating into netbook sales? For some reason I doubt that's the case. Right now I'm considering whether or not I what to buy a Chromebook or an iPad. Those are the two choices because I want an always-connected device so I can use it as a Skype-phone as well as for blogging. The Chromebook, a netbook, or an iPad, a tablet. Those are the two choices and it will be an either or choice: one will lose out. If the iPad wasn't in the equation then the Chromebook would win, but the iPad is here.</p>
