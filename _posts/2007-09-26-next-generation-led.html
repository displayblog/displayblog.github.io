<p>PHYSORG.com is reporting information regarding LED advances from scientists in India. Their study can be found in the American Chemical Society's The Journal of Physical Chemistry, September 9 issue. The Indian scientists is reporting an advance toward a white LED that produces pure white light that is suitable for interior lighting. Current white LEDs are not perfect, with slight variations in color and unstable light output. Any light source needs to have a stable color and uniform light output. D. D. Sarma and Angshuman Nag have successfully developed a new LED based on a new phosphor coating. The phosphor is made of a cadmium sulfide and manganese mixture, a semiconductor nanocrystal. The resulting white LED produces a stable shade of white light that remains constant over time. Sarma and Nag are working to improve efficiency for use in everyday applications.</p>
