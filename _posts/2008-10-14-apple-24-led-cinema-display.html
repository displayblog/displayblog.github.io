<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/10/14/live-from-apples-spotlight-turns-to-notebooks-event/">Engadget</a>: Back in August (August 8, 2008 to be exact), I put up <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/08/08/apple-cinema-displays-with-led-backlight/">a post conjecturing that Apple's Cinema Displays would jump to incorporating LED backlights</a>. Well, it has become true. Today, Steve Jobs announced the 24" LED Cinema Display. And it's just $899 and will be available in November.</p>
<p>One of the very interesting things is that Apple will be moving everything to DisplayPort (mini style) and that the 24" LED Cinema Display has a MagSafe connection coming out of it so you can power your MacBook or MacBook Pro. Very nice touch.</p>
<p><em>Update 2008.10.16 9:17PM PST</em> As far as I can see from the specifications of this LCD monitor, Apple is using a white LED backlight. Although the 24" LED Cinema Display gets kudos for being more green, there isn't anything special in terms of performance. In fact, the performance is pretty normal: 1000:1 contrast ratio, 300 cd/m2, 178/178 viewing angles. </p>
<p>There is one spec that seems to be on the low side though: 14ms response time. There isn't any information regarding the color gamut, but I'm assuming it's 72% NTSC. It would have been nice if Apple had gone with a RGB LED backlight and with that a 100% NTSC color gamut, which is great for color precision once hardware calibrated.</p>
