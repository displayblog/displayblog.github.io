<p>Facts: On June 13, a day before FPD Taiwan 2006, AUO announced that it will focus much of its energies on improving LCD TV performance. There are four key technologies that AUO will be focusing on: AMVA, SPD, HiColor and Image Processing Technology.</p>
<p>AMVA stands for Advanced Multi-domain Vertical Alignment. Samsung has theirs and it is called PVA for Patterned Vertical Alginment. Sharp&#39;s ASV, Advanced Super View technology is also based on VA technology. AUO&#39;s AMVA creates more domains than MVA to reduce color shifts at off angles and provides 178 degree viewing angles with contrast ratios of 10:1 and greater. With improved color fidelity at these angles, contrast ratios are improved to over 1200:1.</p>
<p>SPD stands for Simulated Pulsed Driving that provides CRT-like images by using overdrive and scanning backlight techniques. SPD reduces motion blur and has an average response time of 4ms, which is equivalent to 8ms MPRT (Motion Picture Response Time).</p>
<p>HiColor technology uses LED backlights instead of the conventional CCFLs providing a color gamut of 105% NTSC. Color fidelity is improved. Color Management Function is incorporated to eliminate inconsistent chromaticity between light source and signal.</p>
<p>Image Processing Technology incorporates input image data management with dynamic backlight control. The dynamic backlight control adjusts contrast, sharpness, hue, color temperature and saturation to maximize on screen performance.</p>
<p>Opinion: Seems like IPS and VA technologies will reign in large LCD TVs. Overdriving circuitry has been around for at least two years and significantly improves LC rise times. Black frame insertion to mimic a pulse driven display helps to improve LC fall times. The transition from CCFL to LED might take some time due to CCFLs improving color gamuts from 72% to 92% NTSC. Other technologies such as HCFL (Hot Cathode Fluorescent Lamp) might be a better choice in some situations as it has a longer life than either CCFL or LED. Dynamic backlight control that adjusts brightness based on image content has and will improve contrast ratios dramatically. All in all, these technologies will bring LCD TV performance very close to CRTs and at a great price in the near future.</p>
