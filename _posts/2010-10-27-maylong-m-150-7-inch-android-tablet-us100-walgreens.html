<p><a href="http://www.walgreens.com/store/c/maylong-m-150-universe-tablet-pc-powered-by-android/ID=prod6047418-product">Walgreens</a>: I've never heard of Maylong before but the Maylong M-150 is a 7-inch Android tablet that is being sold at Walgreens for just $100. The 7-inch LCD sports a 800x480 pixel format and the touch technology is resistive. What that means is that stuff on it won't look good (low pixel count and visual obstruction due to resistive touch layers on top of the LCD) and you'll need to actually push into the display to get your touches activated.</p>
