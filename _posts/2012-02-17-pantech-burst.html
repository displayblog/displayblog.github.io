<blockquote><p>The Burst is equipped with a 4-inch Super AMOLED display that boasts a WVGA resolution of 800 x 480. This may sound incredibly underwhelming by today's standards -- assuming you're comparing this to $300 phones -- but the pixel density of the device is 233ppi, which is perfectly reasonable. Let's put it another way: this is the same panel featured on the Samsung Nexus S, but without the curved glass. As a warning to those offended by the very existence of PenTile, the Burst is all 'bout the RGBG layout, with some obvious pixelation should you stare at the screen hard enough.</blockquote></p>
<p>So a 800x480 pixel format on a 4-inch display is not underwhelming? The resolution is stated as 233 ppi, but that's based on a calculation method assuming a 3x1 sub-pixel structure. For PenTile Matrix it's a little different. In <a href="/2011/12/04/galaxy-nexus-316-hole-mask/"><em>Galaxy Nexus: 316-Hole Mask &ne; 316 PPI</em></a> I present my argument that the 4.65-inch 1280x720 HD Super AMOLED-equipped Galaxy Nexus does not have a 316-ppi resolution, but limited to a range between 158 and 207 ppi, depending on how many PenTile Matrix sub-pixels are used to render a single pixel. That's quite a bit less than the lofty and inaccurate 316 ppi figure. Applying the same calculations to the Pantech Burst, the 4-inch 800x480 PenTile Matrix Super AMOLED display has a resolution range of 117 to 156 ppi. I'd call that <em>underwhelming</em>. And all it takes is a glance to see pixelations.</p>
