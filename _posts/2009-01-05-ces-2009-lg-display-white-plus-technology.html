<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lg-display">LG Display</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lpl">LPL</a>) will be unveiling its White Plus technology that reduces power consumption by 56% on its <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=32"">32"</a> TFT LCD panel. The White Plus technology enhances the brightness by adding a white pixel to the RGB sub-pixels effectively making it RGBW. The Optimal Power Control (OPC) technology also improves (reduces) power consumption. We have seen this technology being incorporated into smaller LCDs for <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=mobile-phone">mobile phone</a> displays but this is the first time that RGBW has been applied to a large LCD panel. The benefits of an additional white sub-pixel is that brightness is greatly enhanced without having to 1) increase the number of CCFLs (or <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led">LED</a>s) and/or 2) increase the brightness of each of the CCFLs in the backlight. I'm not sure if the pixel structure will be 4 x 1 or 2 x 2. The 2 x 2 RGBW format has been pioneered by <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=clairvoyante">Clairvoyante</a>, which was subsequently purchased by <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=samsung">Samsung</a>.</p>
