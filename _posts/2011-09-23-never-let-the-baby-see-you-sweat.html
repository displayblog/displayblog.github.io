<p><a href="http://trentwalton.com/2011/09/20/unitasking/">Trent Walton</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I noticed something interesting the day I was confined to just 13&acirc;&euro;¬ù of screen space. Even though I couldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t see everything I needed to operate and reference at once, I became more focused. Only seeing one window at a time enabled me to mentally hunker down on the task at hand. My actions felt purposeful; my decisions, deliberate. Surprisingly, my productivity didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t suffer. I did slow down, but also experienced a calm efficiency&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;similar to that which is required when fastening the innumerable rows of snaps on a screaming baby&acirc;&euro;&trade;s pajamas. If you rush, you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re going to mess up; if you miss snaps, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s going to take longer. And rushing makes you sweat. Never let the baby see you sweat.</blockquote></p>
<p>Walton usually does his design work on a 27-inch iMac but it broke down for a day. Going from a 27-inch LCD with 2560x1440 pixels down to a 13-inch with much less could be limiting. And that's exactly what happened: he was forced to limit his focus on the task at hand one task at a time. In his post he shares more secrets to his unitasking success.</p>
