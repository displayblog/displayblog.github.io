<p>On June 9, 2008, Chunghwa Picture Tubes (CPT), a smaller display manufacturer behind AU Optronics (AUO) and Chi Mei Optoelectronics (CMO), announced June shipment results. CPT reported consolidated TFT LCD sales of NT$9.05 billion, down 18.3% M/M and 26.3% Y/Y. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/07/08/auo-revenues-decrease-17-in-june-2008/">AUO also experienced roughly the same declines in revenues in June</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of unit shipments, large-area TFT LCD declined 11% M/M and 12.4% Y/Y to 2.11 million. Small/medium panel shipments increased 8% M/M to 2.74 million units.</p>
<p>For Q2'08 large-area TFT LCD panel shipments declined 0.58% Q/Q to 6.83 million units while small/medium LCD panel unit shipments dropped 28.8% Q/Q to 9.59 million.</p>
<p>I don't expect Q3'08 sales to increase as they have in past years due to a troubling economy in one of the largest markets for LCD TVs, LCD monitors and notebook PCs. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/07/09/lg-display-shipments-increase-3-qq-in-q208/">Folks at LG Display, on the other hand, expect large gains in Q3'08</a>.</p>
