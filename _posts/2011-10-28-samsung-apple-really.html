<blockquote><p>Samsung in the July-to-September period surpassed Apple Inc. as the leading seller of smartphones by shipping around 28 million, about four times the number it achieved a year earlier, in a rapid transformation of its biggest business by sales. Apple said earlier this month it shipped around 17 million smartphones in the same period.</blockquote></p>
