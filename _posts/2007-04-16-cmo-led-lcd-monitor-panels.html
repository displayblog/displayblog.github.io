<p class="P2">According to DigiTimes, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=chi-mei-optoelectronics">Chi Mei Optoelectronics</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=cmo">CMO</a>) is shipping LED-based <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=19"-lcd-monitor">19" LCD monitor</a> panels to <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=acer">Acer</a> and 22" LED-based panels to <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=viewsonic">ViewSonic</a><em>.</em> CMO currently ships LED-based <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=12.1"">12.1"</a>, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=13.3"">13.3"</a>, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=14.1"">14.1"</a> notebook panels, and 17", 19" inch LCD monitor panels in small volumes. I am not quite sure what the value of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led-backlight">LED backlight</a>s are for average-sized LCD monitors. For notebook PCs that require a bit more thinning and a bit more battery power, white LEDs can do the trick, albeit for quite a bit more money. For large LCD monitors and LCD TVs, you can enhance the color gamut, do some cool tricks with the backlight with LED technology (separate <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=rgb-led">RGB LED</a>s or a single LED package with RGB chips inside), but at a substantial price premium, of course. So, what's the use for regular 17" or 19" LCD monitors? Thinner? Better color gamut for folks that really want that but are only willing to pay $199? I think there's a mismatch. Ooops. Wait. I know now. It has to do with being green: no mercury, less overall material (thinner), lower power consumption (?), etc. So that's it: Green.</p></p>
