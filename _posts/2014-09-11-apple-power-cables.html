<p>Farhad Manjoo, <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/10/why-doesnt-the-apple-watch-have-wireless-charging-because-it-probably-wouldnt-work-very-well/">The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Which means that for the foreseeable future, you can expect to be stuck with lots of ways to charge your gadgets. Soon, Apple will have three different kinds of charging systems &mdash; one cord for the Mac, one for the iPhone and iPad, and one for the Watch.</blockquote></p>
