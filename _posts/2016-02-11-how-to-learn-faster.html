<p>[ <a href="http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/want_to_learn_a_new_skill_faster_change_up_your_practice_sessions">Johns Hopkins</a> ] </p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What we found is if you practice a slightly modified version of a task you want to master, you actually learn more and faster than if you just keep practicing the exact same thing multiple times in a row,&rdquo; says Celnik. The work, described in the Jan. 28 edition of the journal Current Biology, has implications not only for leisure skills, like learning to play a musical instrument or a sport, but also for helping patients with stroke and other neurological conditions regain lost motor function, he says.</blockquote></p>
<p>The key is <em>slightly</em>.</p>
<p>I enjoy learning, but sometimes the pace is slower than I'd like. Here is a list of some of the things I'm trying to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to program in Swift and develop an app I've been needing but haven't found on the App Store.</li>
<li>How to code better in HTML and CSS so I can make the websites I want.</li>
<li>How to design better using Sketch.</li>
<li>How to write better.</li>
<li>How to talk persuasively and eloquently.</li>
<li>How to take beautiful photographs: Check out <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jnskm/">my Instagram feed at @jnskm</a> and let me know what you think.</li>
<li>How to talk, read, and write in Japanese and Chinese.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>There are many more things I'd like to learn, but as you have probably figured out I don't have enough time, not if I want to be really good at them. The research by Johns Hopkins was limited to motor skills, but because everything we do connect back to the brain I think the approach of slightly modifying our practice when learning something can also be applied to skills that are non-motor.</p>
