<blockquote><p>In postings to the <a href="http://en.community.dell.com/dell-blogs/direct2dell/b/direct2dell/archive/2013/02/18/xps-13-now-features-full-hd-screen-for-customers-in-several-countries.aspx">Dell Community</a> site and to Dell Web Vertical Director Barton George's <a href="http://bartongeorge.net/2013/02/18/spuntik-2-is-here-xps-13-developer-edition-goes-1080p-and-launches-in-emea/">blog</a>, Dell has announced that as of today, the XPS-13 Developer Edition will be equipped with a "1080p" screen.</blockquote></p>
<p>Originally the Ubuntu-powered Dell XPS-13 Developer Edition featured an anemic 1366x768 pixel format. There's also speculation the LCD could be of the IPS variety.</p>
