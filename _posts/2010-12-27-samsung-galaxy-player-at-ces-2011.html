<blockquote><p>The 9.9mm thick Galaxy Player (YP-GB1) runs on Android 2.2 Froyo OS and features a 1GHz CPU, 4-inch Super Clear LCD screen supporting up to WVGA resolution (800&Atilde;&mdash;480), T-DMB, SoundAlive audio enhancing technology, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 3.0, 3.2MP rear camera with front facing camera for video calling, GPS, HD video playback, microSD card slot, Android Market and Samsung Apps access and a 1200mAh removable battery.</blockquote></p>
<p>Where's 3G??? I thought the Samsung Galaxy Player was going to be the iPod touch with 3G. I'm keeping my fingers crossed. <em>If</em> the Galaxy Player does end up being the Galaxy S without the ability to make regular phone calls, but have 3G like the iPad, this little gadget can unshackle us from the monthly money-sucking vacuum: mandatory voice call minutes.</p>
