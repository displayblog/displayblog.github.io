<p>The HTC 7 Surround is a 3.8-inch 800x480 WP7 smartphone that will be coming to AT&T in the US and to Telus in Canada. All of the initial WP7 smartphones that were announced today sport 800x480 pixel formats. I guess Microsoft isn't going after Apple in terms of pixel density. Understandably so since Microsoft is working with many hardware manufacturers and they all need multiple stable sources for LCDs with 800x480.</p>
<p>The HTC 7 Surround has an unusual feature: a slideout speaker. I'm guessing it's a surround sound speaker looking at the name. And I do have moments when I'm watching a video or listening to music on my iPhone 4 and wished the sound was in stereo and a bit louder. But the slideout speaker is the <em>only</em> differentiating factor on the HTC 7 Surround. Interesting proposition. Priced at US$199.99 with a two-year agreement at AT&T. Oh, apologies, there's an integrated kickstand too.</p>
