<p>Yukari Iwatani Kane, et al., <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303661904576455863730268934.html#ixzz1Sa3s3mcO">The Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since Steve Jobs went on medical leave this winter, some members of Apple Inc.'s board have discussed CEO succession with executive recruiters and at least one head of a high-profile technology company, according to people familiar with the matter.</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple is best with Steve Jobs calling the shots. Apple isn't very good without Steve Jobs in absolute control. And Apple starts to rot when there is someone else at the top.</p>
<p>Erica Slivka, <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2011/07/19/apple-directors-informally-exploring-ceo-succession-possibilities/">MacRumors</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>While Apple declined to comment for the report, Jobs reportedly responded via email, saying "I think it's hogwash." Consequently, the Journal suggests that Jobs may have been unaware of the discussions.</blockquote></p>
