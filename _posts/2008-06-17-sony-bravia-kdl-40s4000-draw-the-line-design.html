<p>On June 16, 2008, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sony">Sony</a> announced its BRAVIA S4000 line of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a>s sporting Sony's 'draw the LINE' design concept that sports a simple pared-down design. The S4000 series come in four sizes, but the one you should be most interested in is the 40" KDL-40S4000. You see, only the KDL-40S4000 sports a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a> pixel format from the S4000 line. Second, the 40" features the BRAVIA Engine 2 while the other ones don't. They (26", 32", 37") are stuck with the regular BRAVIA Engine (without the '2').</p>
<p>The KDL-40S4000 sips very little power when in standby mode, just 0.19W. It is environmentally friendly in other ways: all cover and housing parts that are 25g and heavier along with the printed circuit boards (PCBs) are halogen-free. Also, the built-in ambient light sensor measures the brightness of the environment and toggles the brightness of the TV. This can get annoying sometimes and personally, I would turn it off, is possible.</p>
