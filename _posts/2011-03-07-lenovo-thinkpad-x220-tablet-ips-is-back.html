<p><a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/ISS_Static/ww/wci/us/ww/pdf/x220_tablet_datasheet.pdf">Lenovo</a>: The ThinkPad X220 Tablet makes use of a 12.5-inch 1366x768 IPS TFT LCD. There are two versions. One is a two-finger touch, five-finger gesture with an Infinity Glass cover. The other makes use of directly bonded Corning Gorilla Glass for pen input. It's about time IPS made a comeback in notebook PCs.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> <a href="http://www.notebookreview.com/default.asp?newsID=6056&p=2">Jerry Jackson, NotebookReview</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The 12.5-inch screen on our review unit of the ThinkPad X220 is an optional IPS panel with LED backlighting. The screen features the same 1366 x 768 resolution as the standard display, but the IPS panel provides greater screen brightness, more contrast and wider viewing angles. Our lab test results show this screen has a 743:1 contrast ratio and a peak brightness of 263 nit. Horizontal and vertical viewing angles are quite simply superb; we barely noticed any color distortion even out to extreme viewing angles.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://www.laptopmag.com/review/laptops/lenovo-thinkpad-x220.aspx">Avram Piltch, LAPTOP Magazine</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The 12.5-inch 1366 x 768 matte display on the ThinkPad X220 offers bright, sharp images and amazingly wide viewing angles. Even standing at 90 degrees to the left or right, we were able to watch videos without noticing a significant loss of color fidelity. Our only complaint is that Lenovo chose to go with a 16:9, 1366 x 768 aspect ratio after offering 16:10, 1280 x 800 displays on the ThinkPad X201. While 1366 x 768 has become a standard, it offers less vertical real estate for viewing documents and web pages.</blockquote></p>
<p>A matte IPS LCD on a notebook. Simply brilliant. I also prefer more vertical pixels given the choice, as long as there are at least 1280 (or 1920) horizontal pixels. For example, I would pick 1280x800 over 1366x768, and 1920x1200 over 1920x1080. I also do not like pixel formats that are in between 1280 and 1920 horizontal pixels such as: 1440x900, 1600x900, 1680x1050. HD video, whether 720p or 1080p, will always need to be scaled, which means less video quality. Having said that the loss of 32 vertical pixels isn't such a big deal if that means I get to have IPS. But there is just one problem with IPS: You need to watch out for peepers in public spaces and in airplanes, especially when you're working on sensitive stuff.</p>
