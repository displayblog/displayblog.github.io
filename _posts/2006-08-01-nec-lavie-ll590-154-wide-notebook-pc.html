<p>The LaVie LL590 is a 15.4" wide notebook with 1280 x 800 resolution. Other specs include: 768MB RAM, ATi Radeon Xpress 1100 GPU, AMD Turion 64 X2 TL-50 CPU or a Mobile AMD Sempron 3200+. The OS is Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 and has a "superdrive" DVD burner, a 100GB HDD, 5-in-1 memory card reader, 802.11a/b/g WiFi, and 4 USB 2.0 ports. NEC's LaVie LL590 will cost about US$1350.</p>

<p>The design doesn't do it for me. Aside from the white exterior, there is nothing special, especially the components used. With useable 15.4" notebooks from Dell and HP costing only 1/2 as much, this unit is way overpriced. If you want white, go for Apple's 13.3" Macbooks for less.</p>
