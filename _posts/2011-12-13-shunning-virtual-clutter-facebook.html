<blockquote><p>Erika Gable, 29, who lives in Brooklyn and does public relations for restaurants, never understood the appeal of Facebook in the first place. She says the daily chatter that flows through the site &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; updates about bad hair days and pictures from dinner &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; is virtual clutter she doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t need in her life.</blockquote></p>
