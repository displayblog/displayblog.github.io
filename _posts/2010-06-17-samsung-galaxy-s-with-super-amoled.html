<p>The main difference between a Super AMOLED and a non-Super is that touch is integrated into the screen instead of an extra layer on top of it. The first phone to have donned a Super AMOLED display was Samsung's Wave that debuted on February 14, 2010. Samsung's Galaxy S is the second. The Super AMOLED is 20% brighter, reflects 80% less sunlight and consumes 20% less power. It's thinner too. Color, according to Samsung, is more vivid and natural. Color is more vivid since that extra touch layer is removed thanks to better light transmittance. Viewing angles are improved too.&Acirc;&nbsp;You can watch a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQkLMG3SBQ4&amp;feature=player_embedded">video</a> (no audio though) Samsung put out explaining what Super AMOLED is all about.&Acirc;&nbsp;Samsung's Super AMOLED display uses the same sub-pixel structure as non-Supers: Nouvoyance's PenTile Matrix (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/01/20/nexus-one-pentile-matrix-oled-display/">Nexus One PenTile Matrix OLED Display</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/02/22/display-showdown-part-ia-nexus-one/">Display Showdown Part Ia: Nexus One</a> </em>for more details). The Super AMOLED will be exclusive to Samsung smartphones for eighteen months. Too bad for HTC, Nokia and others.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/16/samsung-galaxy-s-preview/">Engadget</a>'s Vladislav Savov:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our opinion hasn't changed at all here: this is one of the finest displays you can hope to lay eyes on.</blockquote><br />
In the same review he mentions an extremely glossy and reflective screen. The Super AMOLED is better than non-Supers in sunlight but only when looking at it head on. Look at it from an angle and it sucks just as bad as non-Supers. IPS killing? You mean the one in Apple's iPhone 4? You must be kidding Savov. The pixel format, resolution, screen reflectance, multitouch, optical lamination, etc. of the Retina Display (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/07/iphone-4/">iPhone 4</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/09/retina-display/">Retina Display</a></em> for more details) would make for a very difficult if not impossible killing.</p>
<p>He also mentions terrific color and vibrancy which is another way of sharing one's opinion regarding the pop in colors, which serves as a hint to less-than-ideal color accuracy. My guess is the Galaxy S is just as bad as the Nexus One and all other AMOLED-based smartphones out there when it comes to color accuracy. There might be a simple reason for this: I believe color correction or control is much more complex on PenTile Matrix OLED displays due to the unique sub-pixel structure than regular RGB TFT LCDs. Unless PenTile Matrix-aware hardware and software color calibration tools are developed the problem of overblown inaccurate color will continue to plague the AMOLED displays coming out of Samsung. Of course even when those tools are available simple color calibration would not be possible since power consumption would also be affected.</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: According to <a href="http://www.att.com/shop/wireless/devices/samsung-captivate.jsp">AT&amp;T</a>, Samsung's Galaxy S will make a cameo appearance as Samsung's Captivate in the coming months.</p>
