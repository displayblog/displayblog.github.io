<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/27/sharp-announces-galapagos-e-reading-tablets-5-5-and-10-8-inches/">Engadget</a>: The Sharp Galapagos comes in two sizes: 5.5 and 10.8 inches. The 5.5-inch LCD sports a pixel format of 1024x600 and the larger 10.8-inch version packs 1366x800 pixels. I'm always curious as to whether new portable gadgets are getting anywhere close to Apple's Retina Display's resolution. So, I went to my handy-dandy PPI calculator and punched in some numbers. All numbers are in PPI (Pixels Per Inch).</p>
<ul>
<li>Retina Display (~3.5 inches): 326</li>
<li>5.5-inch Galapagos: 215.79</li>
<li>10.8-inch Galapagos: 146.58</li>
<li>iPad (9.7 inches): 131.96</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>The Retina Display bests the 5.5-inch Galapagos by a mile. But the larger iPad has an anemic resolution of just around 132 PPI. My guess it that Apple is working hard to rectify this major difference by announcing in January a brand spanking new iPad packing an unheard of 2048x1536 pixels! Read "<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/09/08/2011-ipad/">2011 iPad</a>". Back to the Galapagos, which by the way, was named that way because Sharp thinks these two ereaders are evolutionary. I couldn't agree more: a very tiny evolutionary step these Galapagos ereaders are.</p>
<p>Both Galapagos ereaders sport WiFi BG, but no N, wireless connectivity. I would guess the Galapagos ereaders feature 3G connectivity since Sharp is touting automatic scheduled delivery of newspapers, magazines and books. Availability is slated for December and probably just in Japan. </p>
<p>Is there pent up demand for tablets that are small than the iPad? Sharp and Samsung as well as many others seem to think so. Does Apple? There are rumors of a 7-inch iPad in the works, but we'll have to see come January.</p>
