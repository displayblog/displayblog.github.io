<p><a href="http://www.precentral.net/palm-pre-plus-vs-palm-pre-multitasking-mayhem">Pre Central's Dieter Bohn on the Palm Pre Plus</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>... the Palm Pre Plus is a multitasking monster.</blockquote><br />
Dieter wanted to know how many apps the Pre Plus could run simultaneously without getting the memory error. The original Pre topped out at 13 apps. The Pre Plus? Dieter opened up 50 and the Pre Plus kept on going. The point is: don't worry about how many apps you've got running on the Pre Plus. Batter power is, of course, a completely different matter.</p>
