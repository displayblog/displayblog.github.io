<p>In my opinion, AUO will need to borrow heavily since the company is expecting to return to profitability in the second half of this year. And that expectation is based on two conditions: continued strong demand for LCD TV panels from China and a rebound in demand from North America and Western Europe. China's LCD TV panel demand will continue but I am not so sure that there will be a strong rebound in demand for LCD TV sets in North America and Western Europe. I do expect LCD demand from North America to begin growing at the end of summer at the end of August thanks to back-to-school sales of notebook PCs and monitors in addition to the overall economy starting to grow again.</p>
