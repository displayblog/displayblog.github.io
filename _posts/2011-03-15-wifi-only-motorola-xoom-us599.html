<p><a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/759029-REG/Motorola_00001NARGNLX_Xoom_Wi_Fi_10_1_Tablet.html">B&H</a>: At $599 the WiFi-only Motorola Xoom is the regular Motorola Xoom minus the 3G for the same price. Of course you aren't tied down to a two-year agreement with the WiFi-only version, so that's a good thing. But I wouldn't spend that kind of money on a WiFi-only tablet. Instead I would save myself $200 and get an iPad 2.</p>
