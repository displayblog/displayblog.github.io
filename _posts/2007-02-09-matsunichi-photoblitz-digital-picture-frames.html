<p>Matsunichi's photoblitz-branded digital picture frames come in two sizes: 5.6" and 8". The digital picture frames have an interchangeable bezel with cherry wood and black as color options. The photoblitz digital picture frame work in a simple manner by inserting your memory card and supports CF, Microdrive, SmartMedia (SMC), MemoryStick (and Pro?), SD, xD and MMC.</p>
<p>The 5.6" PF560 has a pixel format of 320 x 234 and the 8.0" PF800 sports 800 x 600. The two feature built-in speakers, is wall-mountable, can be positioned landscape or portrait, and has audio/video out connections. Source: <a href="http://www.matsunichi.com/photoblitz.asp">Matsunichi</a></p>
<p>During CES 2007, Matsunichi unveiled a 7" iPF7. The iPF7 has an iPod docking station and displays pictures (JPEG) and plays audio (MP3) and video (MPEG2) on its 7" wide screen with a 16:9 aspect ratio. There are built-in speakers, 128MB of internal memory and two memory slots that support SD, CF, xD, MS and MMC. The iPF7 is compatible with the first and second generation iPod nanos, the iPod mini and the latest iPods with video.

<p>I was curious about Matsunichi as I have never heard of the brand and it seems it is a Hong Kong-based company. Unfortunately, the <a href="http://www.matsunichi.com.hk/matsunichiweb/en/index.jsp#">company's main website</a>'s menu seems to use a lot of pop-up windows that do not seem to work well with FireFox 2.0.</p>
