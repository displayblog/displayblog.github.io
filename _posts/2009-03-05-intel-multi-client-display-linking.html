As in the picture there are four displays that are acting as one. I can see this being very useful for playing board games and exchanging pictures, etc. I can imagine flicking pictures to one another. Of course the displays will need to be touch-capable. I wonder how different pixel formats will work? How would different graphics capabilities be resolved? I'm sure folks at Intel are working on them.</p>
