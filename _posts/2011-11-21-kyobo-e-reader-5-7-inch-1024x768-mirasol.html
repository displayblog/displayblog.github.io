<p><a href="http://www.mirasoldisplays.com/press-center/press-releases/2011/11/kyobo-korea&acirc;&euro;&trade;s-largest-bookseller-introduces-kyobo-branded-color-">Qualcomm</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Qualcomm MEMS Technologies, Inc. (QMT) a wholly owned subsidiary of Qualcomm Incorporated, and Kyobo Book Centre, Korea&acirc;&euro;&trade;s largest seller of books, today announced the retail availability of the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s first e-reader to include mirasol display technology.</blockquote></p>
<p>Note the 4:3 aspect ratio. E Ink Kindles are also 4:3 and so is the iPad. But unlike them the Kyobo e-Reader packs a resolution of 223 ppi. I expect a pleasurable reading experience.</p>
<p>Mirasol attempts to combine the responsiveness of color LCD and the long lasting, power sipping E Ink. Did Qualcomm succeed? Close, but not quite. A Mirasol based e-reader or tablet lasts as long as one based on E Ink with video capable fast response times. That alone is an accomplishment, but the problem is color. Compared to LCD color is far from vibrant.</p>
<p>For those wanting their tablets to last as long as E Ink, Mirasol is disappointing because of its pale colors. On the other hand, for those wanting E Ink with color, Mirasol looks pretty good. Page turns are instant, video playback is possible, and you get some color.</p>
<p>Compared to the $99 Kindle Touch, the $199 Kindle Fire and the Nook Tablet, the Kyobo e-Reader seems a bit expensive at &#8361;349,000 or about US$300.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> <a href="http://www.netbooknews.com/41402/kyobo-5-7-ereader-with-mirasol-display-walk-through-with-video-playback/">Netbooknews</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The colours on the display were decent though could have been more vibrant and they viewing angle left a lot to be desired as I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m sure you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll notice in the video below. The reds especially seemed to in need of a little bit of a boost and if you think back to the canned demo&acirc;&euro;&trade;s we saw at the beginning of this year you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll quickly realize that the colour saturation is much lower.</p>
<p>The fact that the device has a glossy display certainly didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t help when checking colour brilliance in direct sunlight. It is worth noting that the display doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t need to be glossy and we hope that future iterations take note that mobile devices, especially ones that require sunlight to light up the screen shouldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have issues with glare.</blockquote></p>
<p>A glossy reflective display is asking for trouble: trouble reading that is. This is a first generation Mirasol-based e-reader, so let's hope Qualcomm moves in the right direction with more brilliant colors in a matte display.</p>
