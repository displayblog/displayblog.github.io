<blockquote><p>It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s an appcessory billed as a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;personal environment monitor,&acirc;&euro;¬ù and through its collection of four peripherals, Lapka gathers analog measures of humidity/temperature, radiation, electromagnetic frequencies (EMF), and organicity (whether or not a food is truly organic). And it does so beautifully, with a mix of plastic and wood components--aesthetics that were considered down to the circuit boards, which will also match in white.</blockquote></p>
