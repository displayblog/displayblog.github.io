<p><a http://www.engadget.com/2011/03/12/hello-i-must-be-going/">Joshua Topolsky</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>After nearly four years at Engadget, it's time to make my exit. There are things I'm after and challenges I want to take on that just don't fit with my day-to-day schedule here, so off I go.</blockquote></p>
<p>I enjoyed Joshua Topolsky's articles most at Engadget. He's not leaving the gadget news industry so I'm looking forward to when he resurfaces.</p>
