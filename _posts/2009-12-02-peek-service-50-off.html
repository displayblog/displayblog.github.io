<p>It is Cyber Wednesday according to Peek. And they are celebrating by offering you 50% off of the $19.99 monthly service. So now you just pay $9.99/mo for Peek for life*. *Life means "for lifetime of device when you purchase on 12/2/09". And what that means is that you can't lose it or break it for as long as you want to use it.
