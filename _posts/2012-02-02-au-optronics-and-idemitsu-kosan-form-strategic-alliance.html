<blockquote><p>"This will accelerate business growth in AUO's small-sized OLED displays for smartphones and tablets, which have emerged as a new growth area in the display industry, and that of large-sized OLED displays for TVs," AU Optronics said.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://www.idemitsu.com/products/electronic/el/index.html">Idemitsu Kosan</a> is a Tokyo-based chemical company with a long history dating back to 1911. The company develops OLED materials for the electron transfer layer, organic luminescent layer, hole transfer layer, and hole injection layer. Despite its alliance with Idemitsu Kosan, I think AUO is far from commercializing large OLED displays for TV applications, but I could end up being completely wrong.</p>
<p>You see I did not believe it was possible to mass manufacture very large OLED TVs this year or next year or even the year after that. LG and Samsung are targeting the second half of 2012 to commercialize their 55-inch OLED TVs that were shown during CES. The two companies are using very different OLED technologies. LG is making use of a unique method called <a href="/2012/01/09/woled/">WOLED</a> while Samsung is applying its OLED technology found in the company's Galaxy-line of smartphones to a much bigger 55-inch substrate.</p>
<p>Without a doubt both OLED TVs will consume a considerable amount of power, will not last as long as LCD, plasma, or CRT, and be extremely expensive. We don't know for sure whether or not these 55-inch OLED TVs will actually materialize in 2012, but if LG and Samsung delivers on their promises it will be a banner year for OLED TV.</p>
