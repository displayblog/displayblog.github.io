<p>LG has always built sophisticated and powerful notebook PCs. LG comes through again with its LG P300. The P300 is in response to Lenovo's X300, Apple's MacBook Air and a few other lightweight 13.3" notebook PCs. The main marketing theme is that the P300 is light and thin. The P300 is on the light side at 3.52lbs but ends up being porkier than both the X300 and MacBook Air. Have a look at the comparison below. The P300 is thin too and has a wedge design that is popular these days: 0.83" to 0.90". Clearly, the MacBook Air is much thinner and so is the X300. So neither is the P300 the thinnest or the lightest.</p>
<ul>
<li>LG P300: 1.6kg (3.52lbs), 21mm - 32mm (0.83" - 0.90") thin<br />
</li>
<li>Apple MacBook Air: 1.36kg (3.0lbs) 0.40mm - 19.4mm (0.16" - 0.76") thin<br />
</li>
<li>Lenovo X300: 1.42kg (3.12lbs w/3-cell), 18.6mm - 23.4mm (0.53" - 0.66") thin<br />
</li></ul><br />
So what's the P300 got? According to LG, it is really fast and has a trendy design. Let's look at the design first. The company calls the pattern used on the back of the LCD as "Blackrose Pattern". The design is quite compelling and the unit seems to be quite sexy indeed. The LCD housing is black while the keyboard area is aluminum-colored. The 13.3" LCD seemed to have allowed enough room on the keyboard for an extra column of keys on the far right.</p>
<p>The P300 looks like it has what it takes to be an extremely fast machine. The P300 does have a very fast T9300 CPU: much much faster than either the X300 or the MacBook Air. In addition, the nVidia GeForce 8600M GS with 256MB will blow the socks of the other two as well. LG touts that the P300 can be used for 3D gaming as well as high-end graphics tasks. The P300 also has 1GB of Intel's Turbo Memory that is ~2.6x faster at loading applications compared to a typical HDD and ~20% faster at booting.</p>
<p>The 13.3" LCD has a LED backlight and LG states that it is much thinner and lighter than CCFL-based backlights. I didn't know they were lighter; I guess they are. Finally, the P300 has an HDMI-Out that allows it to be connected to a new generation of LCD monitors that seem to be featuring HDMI these days.</p>
