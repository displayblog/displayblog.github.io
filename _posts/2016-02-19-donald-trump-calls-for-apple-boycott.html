<p>[ <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2016/02/19/donald-trump-apple-boycott-iphone/">9to5Mac</a> ] Zac Hall:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here&rsquo;s the kicker: As news broke that Trump was calling for a boycott on Apple until it cooperates with the FBI, Donald Trump (or whoever manages his Twitter account) was tweeting a series of unrelated messages &hellip; from Twitter for iPhone.</blockquote></p>
<p>Now Donald Trump is using Twitter for Android. Another interesting tidbit:</p>
<blockquote><p>Maybe this explains why close Trump ally and infamous Apple investor Carl Icahn (who Trump wants as Treasury Secretary) <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2016/02/16/apple-carl-icahn-aapl-stock-cut/">recently dumped millions of Apple shares</a>.</blockquote></p>
<p>If you watch <a href="https://youtu.be/oe9ydy_zwe8">the video of Trump calling for a boycott on Apple</a>, he mentions that he <em>just</em> thought of it. Why would he emphasize that? (I haven't watched many election-related political videos so it might be that Trump regularly says he just came up with something.)</p>
