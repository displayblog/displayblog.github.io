<p><a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/11/18/tj-maxx-selling-ipad-for-399/">CrunchGear</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/18/ipads-fondue-sets-appearing-at-tj-maxx-locations-across-the-cou/">Engadget</a>: TJ Maxx will be (is?) selling a 16GB WiFi iPad for just $399. That is $100 less than at the Apple Store. Engadget called a couple of stores and one of them stated that the iPad deal will go live on Black Friday. This sale will certainly get a lot of folks into the store, if that's what they're hoping for.</p>
