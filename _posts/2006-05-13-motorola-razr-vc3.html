<p>I just picked up a RAZR VC3. The VC3 version is a CDMA version that works on Verizon. Like so many people before me who has already purchased the RAZR, I dig the design. It is slim and just plain nice. I like the blue-lit keyboard too. I heard they use laser to etch the numbers and letters--very high tech. I'm posting this blog just to make sure I get the specifics for both displays on the RAZR.</p>
<p>Sub-display: 96*80 pixels 4k color (most likely CSTN)<br />
Main-display: 2.2" 176*220 pixel 65K color TFT LCD</p>
<p>Anybody know the size of the sub-display?</p>
