<blockquote><p>So when I bought a TouchPad after HP discontinued it, I never assumed that I would use it for actual work. But I <em>am</em> doing just that. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m using it to respond to email, to do research on the Internet, to take notes during meetings.</p>
<p>So why was it so easy for me to use the TouchPad for work, but not the iPad? I think it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s because there are a number of things the TouchPad does that make it more suitable for work.</blockquote></p>
<p>Makes me want to hop on Craigslist, buy the TouchPad, and take it for a spin.</p>
