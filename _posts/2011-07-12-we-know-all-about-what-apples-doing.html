<p>Stephen DeWitt, new webOS champion at HP, <em>via</em> an interview with Brian Heater at <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/07/12/the-engadget-interview-hps-stephen-dewitt/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Look, Apple came to the market two years before we did with their iPad. We know all about their iPad, we know all about what it does well, we know all about what Apple's doing.</blockquote></p>
<p>No wonder the TouchPad looks like the first-gen iPad. Steve Jobs must be shocked. </p>
