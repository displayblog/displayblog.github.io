<p><a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/john-sculley-on-steve-jobs-the-full-interview-transcript/63295">Cult of Mac</a> editor Leander Kahney interviews John Sculley, the ex-Pepsi guy best known for kicking Jobs out of Apple. Sculley shares the secrets to Jobs' success:</p>
<p>Beautiful Design, End-To-End Customer Experience, No Focus Groups:</p>
<blockquote><p>Steve said: "How can I possibly ask somebody what a graphics-based computer ought to be when they have no idea what a graphic based computer is? No one has ever seen one before."</blockquote></p>
<p>Perfectionism, Big Vision, Minimalism, Systems Thinker:</p>
<blockquote><p>He&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a minimalist and is constantly reducing things to their simplest level. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not simplistic. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s simplified. Steve is a systems designer. He simplifies complexity.</blockquote></p>
<p>Keep It Small:</p>
<blockquote><p>I can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t remember more than a hundred first names so I only want to be around people that I know personally... The way I like to work is where I touch everything.</blockquote></p>
<p>Reject Bad Work:</p>
<blockquote><p>... he would be almost merciless in terms of rejecting their work until he felt it had reached the level of perfection that was good enough...</blockquote></p>
<p>And: Hire The Best, Sweat The Details.</p>
