<p>The new crop of 19" wide LCD monitors sport a 1440 x 900 pixel format, slightly less than the king of wide (for the number of units sold) 20" with 1680 x 1050 pixel formats. If you look at a 19' wide LCD monitor, it will look smallish. That's because the height of the 19" wide is only tall as a 17" 1280 x 1024 (5:4 aspect ratio). And why does that matter? Because the human visual system determines to a large degree how big a screen is by how large it is vertically. So would folks shell out about $50 more for a 19" wide? Let's do the math. You get 1.31 megapixels for the 17" and they cost around $250. The 19" wide gets you 1.296 megapixels (slightly less) and will cost around $300. But... you do get the wide factor. How about you do this instead: For $350-$375, go get a 20" wide that will give you a ton more pixels (1.764 megapixels), a wide format, for about $100 more than a 17"? That's what I would do. So, between the CX915BW and the CX203BW, my choice would be the later. Pricing on these units are: 350 euros for the 19" and 450 euros for the 20".</p>
