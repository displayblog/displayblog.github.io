<p>Insight Media's <a href="http://displaydaily.com/2010/08/19/sed-finally-admits-its-dead/">Ken Werner</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yesterday, Canon&acirc;&euro;&trade;s board of directors passed a resolution to dissolve and liquidate SED Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary established to develop and commercialize flat-panel displays based on surface-conduction electron-emitter display (SED) display technology. According to the tentative dissolution schedule announce by the BoD, the company will be dissolved on September 30th of this year, and liquidation will be completed by late December.</blockquote></p>
<p>Profitability, or the lack of, killed SED. Interesting tidbits: SED was Canon Chairman and CEO Fujio Mitarai's pet project; he wanted a TV with a Canon logo. And SED panel-related R&D will continue.</p>
