<strong>Sprint/Clearwire:</strong> Would the major carriers be involved? Rumor has it that <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=at%26t&amp;sa=Search#1348">AT&amp;T</a> is already bidding for Google's smartphone business with a $20/mo data deal.

<p><strong>Ad Subsidy</strong> Others say that there might be no subsidies on the Google smartphone. But I think otherwise. What is Google's profit backbone? Ads. If you allow ads on your Google smartphone then Google will give you a subsidized price. If you don't, you get to pay the full price of the smartphone.</p>
<p><strong>Futile Resistance</strong> Even with all of these differences will current Android partners not be happy if Google came out with its own branded smartphone? I don't think it really matters. If you gave me an Android smartphone that gives me freedom from two-year agreements, from expensive calling plans and added features (tethering comes to mind) and provides unlimited phone (VoIP) and data usage worldwide... I don't think I would be able to resist.</p>
