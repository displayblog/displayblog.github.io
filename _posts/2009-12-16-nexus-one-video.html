<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/12/15/nexus-one-finally-caught-on-video-alongside-its-packaging/">Engadget</a>: Finally, a video of the Nexus One. It's blurry and is just the front screen, but the animated background is quite cool. What cool productive purpose can animated backgrounds provide... How about live updates of your Facebook wall or tweets or even RSS subscriptions?</p>
