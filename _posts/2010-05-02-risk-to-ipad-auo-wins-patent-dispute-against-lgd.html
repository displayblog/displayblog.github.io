<p>The US District Court for the District of Delaware found on February 16, 2010 that LG Display (LGD) infringed four AU Optronic (AUO) patents. Those patents are:</p>
<ul>
<li>6,778,160</li>
<li>6,689,629</li>
<li>7,125,157</li>
<li>7,090,506</li><br />
</ul><br />
These patents cover LCD panels for TVs, monitors, notebooks, digital signage and mobile phones.&Acirc;&nbsp;The dispute between AUO and LGD goes back to 2006. The patents focus on technologies that improve response time and reliability.&Acirc;&nbsp;According to AUO there are a lot of products currently being sold in the US and will be seeking injunctions preventing products that use infringing LGD LCDs from being exported to and sold in the US. There is a risk that the 9.7-inch IPS LCD panel made by LGD that goes into Apple's iPad infringes one of AUO's four patents.&Acirc;&nbsp;Source: <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20100503PR200.html">Digitimes</a></p>
