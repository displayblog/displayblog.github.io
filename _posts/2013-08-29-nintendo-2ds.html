<p><a href="http://www.nintendo.com/3ds/new/">Nintendo</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The new Nintendo 2DS system gives you all the features of the Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo 3DS XL, minus 3D viewing.</blockquote></p>
<p>Nintendo should continue making new gaming systems <em>minus 3D viewing</em>. 3D technology as it is implemented today in gaming systems or TVs is not good for your eyes, especially eyes of younger kids.</p>
<p>One note: I don't agree with those who believe single-purpose devices have no future. </p>
<p>Multi-purpose devices like the iPhone is eminently convenient, but if a better mobile OS and app platform comes around with all the apps we're used to there's no reason to stay with a particular platform. The experience of using Twitter is largely the same whether it's on iOS, Android, or Windows Phone. I'm eagerly waiting for <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2013/07/16/sony-honami-xperia-i1/">Sony's 'Honami' smartphone</a> and if the rumors turn out to be true I will be jumping ship.</p>
<p>When you want to play Mario you associate that desire with a Nintendo DS or a Wii. For Nintendo that one-to-one association is a good thing.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> Wait a second. The Nintendo 2DS is <em>not</em> foldable like the others? Not good.</p>
