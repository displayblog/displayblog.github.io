<blockquote><p>The LCD is not fused to the glass, making the glass repair easier on the wallet.</p>
<p>You have to dig through the entire device if you need to replace your cracked glass, but the mid-plane assembly comes out easily with all components attached.</blockquote></p>
<p>Easier and cheaper to repair but once you do you'll be stuck with dust stuck in between. An optically laminated display would have looked nicer but would have certainly been more expensive to buy in the first place and later to repair. But you'd never be bothered by dust. Pros and cons.</p>
