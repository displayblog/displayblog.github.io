<p>[ <a href="https://marco.org/2016/01/04/md101ll-a">Marco Arment</a>&nbsp;] Here are some reasons why:</p>
<ul>
<li>DVD Drive</li>
<li>Hard Drive</li>
<li>Upgradeable RAM</li>
<li>Inexpensive</li>
<li>Not too slow</li><br />
</ul><br />
The 13-inch non-Retina MacBook Pro model number MD101LL/A is&nbsp;simply '101' among Apple employees according to Marco Arment. If hardware tinkering is your thing, the 101 is the last MacBook you can do that with.</p>
<p>I too used to tinker,&nbsp;with my 2009 17-inch MacBook Pro. I replaced the HDD with a SSD and then&nbsp;replaced the SuperDrive with the HDD. I even got a software tool to reduce the frequency and voltage of the CPU so I could take out the two fans. Fan noise drive me up the wall. Check out <a href="http://displayblog.com/2011/04/26/silent-cool-green-macbook-pro/">Silent, Cool, Green MacBook Pro</a> for all the details.</p>
<p>I don't tinker anymore; I now prefer an iPhone-like experience: solid state (no moving parts, except for the buttons and the mute lever) and silent. I&nbsp;want&nbsp;to simply&nbsp;use it. And the most iPhone-like MacBook? The 2015 MacBook.</p>
