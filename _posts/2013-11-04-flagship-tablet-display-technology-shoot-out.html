<p><a href="http://www.displaymate.com/Tablet_ShootOut_3.htm">Raymond Soneira</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most impressive of all is the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9, which has leapfrogged into the best performing Tablet display that we have ever tested, significantly out-performing the iPad Air in Brightness, Screen Reflectance, and high ambient light contrast, plus a first place finish in the very challenging category of Absolute Color Accuracy.</p>
<p>None of these display performance accomplishments happened accidentally&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; The Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 and iPad Air both have impressive display hardware and impressive factory calibration. The Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 has high performance Low Temperature Poly Silicon LTPS LCDs and the iPad Air high performance IGZO Metal Oxide LCDs, significantly better than the a-Si amorphous Silicon LCDs being used in most current displays. Both achieve their excellent picture quality and absolute accuracy through individual detailed factory calibrations of each and every display for both color and intensity scale &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; truly impressive.</blockquote></p>
<p>Kudos to the folks at Lab126, where Amazon does its hardware R&D, for knocking Apple off the Best Tablet Display podium.</p>
