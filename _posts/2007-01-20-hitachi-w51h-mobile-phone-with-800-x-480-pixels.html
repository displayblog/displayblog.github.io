<p>Hitachi's W51H sports a 2.9" LCD with a pixel format of 800 x 480 and is heading to KDDI and its CDMA-based cellular network in Japan. That would make for quite a bit more PPI than Apple's iPhone with a 3.5" LCD with "ony" 320 x 480 pixels leading to perhaps some very nice high-resolution multimedia capabilities. Just as a reference, 800 x 480 is right around the pixel format of standard DVDs. Very nice. Other features of the W51H include a 2 megapixel camera, fingerprint recognition, GPS capability (would look really nice on the LCD) and 30MB of memory.</p>
