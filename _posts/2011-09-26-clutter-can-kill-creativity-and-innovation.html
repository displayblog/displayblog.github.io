<p><a href="http://unclutterer.com/2011/09/26/clutter-can-kill-creativity-and-innovation/">Jonathan Fields writing for Unclutterer</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the years, I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve noticed a strong connection between the state of my physical space and my ability to do high-level creative work. When my space is in disarray, my thoughts are generally also in disarray. I can still function, I can come up with ideas, write decent-enough content and solve-problems. But, I always know that I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m not operating anywhere near my true potential.</blockquote></p>
<p>After reading Patrick Rhone's <a href="http://unclutterer.com/2011/09/26/clutter-can-kill-creativity-and-innovation/"><em>Simplicity, Clutter, Compassion, & Love</em></a> I was compelled to rethink how I go about simplifying, decluttering, having a bit more compassion and love. And after Fields' article, I did what I had to do: dishes and vacuum. I feel better now and am ready for some creative work. At the moment I'm listening to the <a href="http://minimalmac.com/enough/#ep14">Episode 14 - Don't worry. Do.</a> podcast recommended by Rhone.</p>
