<blockquote><p>Regardless of how much money you sink into it, the Envy 14 has a 1366 x 786 display -- a clear let-down from the 1600 x 900 screen we were treated to last year (those sold out and weren't replaced, tragically). If this were a $700 system we wouldn't be complaining, but on a system that costs northward of a thousand bucks, we'd expect more. 1366 x 768 is the mark of a budget machine, not a premium one.</blockquote></p>
<p>The HP Envy 14 sports a 14.5-inch LED backlit LCD with a pixel format of 1366x768. HP calls it the BrightView Infinity LED Display. The much smaller 11.6-inch MacBook Air has the same number of pixels. The resolution of the Envy 14 is a paltry 108 ppi.</p>
<blockquote><p>And yet, one of the things we loved most the first time around -- that stunning display -- just ain't what it used to be. Its resolution is lower, for one, and the entire screen simply isn't as eye-popping now that HP has discontinued its 14.5-inch Radiance panels.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote><p>The 14.5-inch, 1,600 x 900-resolution display is a breath of fresh air compared to the laptops we've recently reviewed. Not only is the resolution better than the 1366 x 768 displays we've been staring at lately, but the quality of the flush glass LCD is miles better than the others HP's used lately. A lot of that has to do with the HP Radiance Infinity LED panel, which was also on the Envy 13. The 350nit display has a higher color gamut than other displays, and you notice the difference upon first boot [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>Last year's HP Envy 14 had the mark of a premium machine; this year's version has the mark of a budget machine, a US$1000 budget machine.</p>
