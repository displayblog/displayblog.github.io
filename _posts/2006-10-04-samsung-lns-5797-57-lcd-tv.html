<p>Samsung showed off the LNS-5797 at CEDIA this year. The LNS-5797 is a 57&acirc;&euro;&sup3; LCD TV that displays Full HD or 1080p with a resolution of 1920 x 1080. MSRP will be $9,999 with a minimum advertised price (MAP) of $8,999. The LNS-5797 should be out before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Samsung also showcased the HPS-6373 plasma TV: a 63&acirc;&euro;&sup3; model but limited to only 1366 x 768 resolution but with a demanding price of $7,999 and a MAP of $6,999. 60-some-odd-inches and you can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t even get 1080p. No thanks. If I had to pick, I would spend $2000 extra to get the LNS-5797. I just read that I would save that much in a year if I stopped drinking at Starbucks everyday.</p>
