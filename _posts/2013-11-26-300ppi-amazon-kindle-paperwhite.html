<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/24/amazons-next-kindle-paperwhite-to-feature-300ppi-screen-better-typography-arrive-early-next-year/">Matthew Panzarino, TechCrunch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Amazon is now preparing a new Kindle Paperwhite for release in early Q2 of next year, TechCrunch has learned. The marquee feature of the new device is a high-resolution 300 ppi screen that will bring the company's e-reader displays back into technical parity with devices from competitors like Kobo.</blockquote></p>
<p>Other bits of this rumor: flush front screen, matte glass, lighter, squeezable haptic buttons, and ambient light sensor. If this rumor pans out the experience of reading on a 300-ppi Amazon Kindle Paperwhite should be most excellent.</p>
