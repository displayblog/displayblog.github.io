<blockquote><p>Warning!</p>
<p>Be sure to insert your S Pen with the nib pointed inward. Inserting the S Pen the wrong way can cause it to become stuck and can damage the pen and your phone.</blockquote><br />
This is user experience design failure. The S Pen should have been designed so it cannot be inserted the wrong way. And if designing such a stylus was not feasible, the insert should have been designed where if you inserted the S Pen the wrong way it should not cause it to get stuck or damage the pen or damage the phone.</p>
