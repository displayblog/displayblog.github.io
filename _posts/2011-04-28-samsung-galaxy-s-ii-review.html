<blockquote><p>The Galaxy S II's screen is nothing short of spectacular. Blacks are impenetrable, colors pop out at you, and viewing angles are supreme.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S II sports a 4.3-inch Super AMOLED Plus display. OLED displays will generally exhibit deeper blacks than almost any other display technology. I'm not a fan of colors that pop since that could simply mean overblown colors, but in the case of the Galaxy S II a most-welcome development is a setting called Background Effect, which allows you to control saturation levels.</p>
<blockquote><p>We'd even go so far as to say it's better than the iPhone 4's screen, purely because, at 4.3 inches, it gives us so much more room to work with.</blockquote></p>
<p>The 4.3-inch Super AMOLED Plus display is better than the 3.5-inch IPS Retina Display, because it's bigger? Sounds weak. The 4.3-inch Super AMOLED Plus has a pixel format of 800x480, which translates into less room in terms of pixels than the 960x640 found on the 3.5-inch IPS Retina Display. And this is a true apples-to-apples comparison because the Super AMOLED Plus display goes back to a typical RGB stripe sub-pixel structure, which I explain in detail in <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/02/22/samsung-super-amoled-plus-dumps-pentile-matrix-goes-real-stripe-rgb/"><em>Samsung Super AMOLED Plus: Dumps PenTile Matrix, Goes Real-Stripe (RGB)</em></a>.</p>
<p>The resolution on the 4.3-inch Super AMOLED Plus display is 217 ppi. I'm merely speculating but someone with a 20/20 vision looking at the Samsung Galaxy S II at a distance of around 12 inches will be able to see the individual pixels. There is a bit of a difference in the way a pixel looks on an OLED display compared to a pixel on a LCD. An OLED phosphor burns, unlike a pixel on a LCD, so it will be more difficult to see individual OLED pixels than on a LCD. So the difference in the overall visual experience of using the Super AMOLED Plus compared to the higher-resolution Retina Display might be less than the difference the numbers indicate.</p>
