<p><a href="http://sviehb.wordpress.com/">Stefan Viehbock</a>:</p><br />
<blockquote>
<p>A few weeks ago I decided to take a look at the <a href="http://www.wi-fi.org/wifi-protected-setup/">Wi-Fi Protected Setup</a> (WPS) technology. I noticed a few really bad design decisions which enable an efficient brute force attack, thus effectively breaking the security of pretty much all WPS-enabled Wi-Fi routers. As all of the more recent router models come with WPS enabled by default, this affects millions of devices worldwide.</p> </blockquote>
<p>Two hours and the WiFi network you thought was secure can be compromised. In addition to possible negative health effects from a router sitting right next to you transmitting WiFi signals at maximum power, the relatively high potential for security breaches make the inconvenience of hardwired Internet connectivity at our home worthwhile.</p></p>
<p><em>Update:</em> Viehbock has released his tool to brute force crack WPS.</p>
