<p>The Elite PRO-FHD1 by Pioneer is a 50" Full HD plasma TV. The price for 2 megapixels (2,073,600 pixels to be exact) is $8000. The unit has two HDMI inputs but lacks any TV tuners.</p>

This plasma TV, unlike many others that claim to be Full HD, does truly have a pixel format of 1920 x 1080 with a true 16:9 aspect ratio. $8000 is also a truly enormous amount for a 50" display. I would much prefer to get about three 40" Full HD LCD TVs and put them in three separate rooms. Or... tile four 37" Full HD LCD TVs!</p>
