<strong>THE FUTURE IS HERE:</strong> There are two very cool things going on here. First, the transparency of the display: reminds me of the transparent displays used in the movie Avatar, The Matrix and The Minority Report. The second is the fact that this isn't an ordinary transparent display; it is an OLED display that is transparent. The OLED is also 14 inches big. Technologically, this 14-inch transparent OLED notebook PC concept from Samsung is quite impressive. I think it would have been even more impressive if there were no bezels. But what would we do with a transparent display on a notebook PC?</p>
<p><strong>NO PRIVACY:</strong> Privacy issues come to mind. I regularly go to cafes, bookstores and public libraries to blog and I wouldn't want everyone around me to know what I'm writing. Not that I'm trying to hide something but it seems too open for anyone to see, albeit reversed, my every move.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSPARENT OLED SMARTPHONE:</strong> Rather than implement a transparent OLED display into a notebook PC the better platform would have been a smartphone. Sure, there is that possibility that someone would be so curious as to squat down in front of you to get a glimpse at what you're doing, but that's a possibility only theoretically and would certainly not happen in real life. With a transparent OLED display on a smartphone you could implement augmented reality. The main challenge in a gadget like that would be to cram all the chips that usually resided behind the display to somewhere else. I just thought of another idea: a transparent (multitouch) OLED digital camera.</p>
