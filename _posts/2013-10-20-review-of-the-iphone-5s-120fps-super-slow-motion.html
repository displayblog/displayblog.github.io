<blockquote><p>Will it replace my FS700 and F55? I think you know the answer! But how often do I go out and about with either of those cameras in my man bag? I would need a man suit case, not a man bag!! As they say they, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;the best camera high frame rate/ super slow motion camera is the one you have on you&acirc;&euro;¬ù and now I have a 120fps camera on me!</blockquote></p>
<p>I still have one year left on my contract, but the iPhone 5s is <em>so</em> tempting.</p>
