<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=panasonic">Panasonic</a>, the major consumer electronics brand of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=matsushita">Matsushita</a>, is planning to mass produce 37" <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=oled">OLED</a> TVs within the next three years. If Panasonic is successful, the 37" OLED TV would be the largest OLED TV in production, by a big margin. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sony">Sony</a> introduced its OLED TV, the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=xel-1">XEL-1</a>, late last year but it is a paltry <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=11"">11"</a> in size and does not have a discreet pixel format that can support <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1080p">1080p</a> content. There also have been questions as to how long the XEL-1 would last and the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2008/05/08/sony-xel-1-17000-hour-lifetime/">only test that has been conducted has put it at just 17,000 hours</a>, much less than what Sony claims: 30,000 hours.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=samsung-sdi">Samsung SDI</a> and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lg">LG</a> are researching OLED technology and have released many technology prototypes over the years, but no plans have come forth for mass production.</p>
<p>Bear in mind, I'm a bit skeptical since <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=toshiba">Toshiba</a> and Matsushita had a joint effort to mass manufacture a 30" OLED TV by 2009. Difficulties transitioning from research into volume production forced the joint effort to cancel their efforts in late 2007. If a 30" OLED TV is difficult, I don't see how a 37" OLED TV would be much easier.</p>
