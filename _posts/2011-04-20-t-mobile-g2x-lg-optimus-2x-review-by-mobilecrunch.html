<blockquote><p>I found the screen to be nice but ultimately unimpressive. 800&Atilde;&mdash;480 at 4&acirc;&euro;&sup3; is plenty sharp, but it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s lacking in brightness. I regularly thought it was at medium brightness when in fact it was at full. For comparison, I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve regularly thought the opposite of the Defy (thought it was on full when it was only on medium, that is), which really has my favorite screen on a non-iPhone handset right now. That said, if you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re not in too bright of lighting conditions, the screen is vibrant and contrasty.</p>
<p>The touchscreen was responsive and quick, though I felt that it was not always responsive to quick taps. I touched the screen at the same rate and with the same pressure as I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve done with the last few phones I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve reviewed and used, so I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t think it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s me, though I haven&acirc;&euro;&trade;t seen the issue in other reviews. That said, most of the time (and especially with &acirc;&euro;&oelig;normal&acirc;&euro; touches as opposed to the light taps used on &acirc;&euro;&oelig;next&acirc;&euro; buttons and such) it tracked beautifully.</blockquote></p>
<p>I'm seeing a trend: the display isn't bright enough and the touch response can be laggy at times.</p>
