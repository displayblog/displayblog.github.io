<p>xRez has a <a href="http://www.xrez.com/el_cap_giga.html">gigapixel image</a> of El Capitan, Yosemite. Although I am not quite convinced that the image has that many pixels, you can zoom in quite a bit and see some really cool details. <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/2006/12/38_gigapixels_o.html">John Nack on Adobe</a> comments that the picture has 3.8 gigapixels! After going to the main site and looking at other "Extreme Resolution" pictures on xRez, I do believe their claim of gigapixel-level pictures to be quite convincing. Have a look: <a href="http://xrez.com/manifest/xRez_manif.html">xRez</a>.</p>
