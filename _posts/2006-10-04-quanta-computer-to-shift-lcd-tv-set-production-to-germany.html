<p>Quanta Computer, the integrator in Taiwan versus Quanta Display Inc., who will be merged into AU Optronics (AUO), will be shifting a portion of its LCD TV set production capacities from Taiwan to Germany to reduce shipping costs. China is a booming market for LCD TVs but so is Europe and for the next few years, Europe will be a much bigger market than China. Quanta is also planning to stop outsourcing TV production to Flextronics and manufacture the TVs by itself. Bad news for Flextronics. Source: DigiTimes</p>
