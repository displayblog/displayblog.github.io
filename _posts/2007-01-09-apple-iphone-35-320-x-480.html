<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=">Apple</a>'s new iPhone has a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=3.5"">3.5"</a> transflective TFT LCD with a pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=320-x-480">320 x 480</a>. Not the highest resolution, but still very high (160ppi) for Apple that has a penchant for sticking to 100-110ppi. Although I am not sure who the LCD supplier is, I have a feeling that it is <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sharp">Sharp</a>. Sharp is known for very high quality LCDs and were the top supplier for the first batch of Sony's PSPs. </p>
<p><strong>Update 2008.05.16</strong><br />
Additional information has been found regarding LCD suppliers: <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sharp">Sharp</a>, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=epson">Epson</a>, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=tmdisplay">TMDisplay</a>. Apple is probably moving toward adding more LCD makers to keep a healthy supply for the millions of iPhones that are being sold.</p>

<p>With Apple's OS X's ability to render fonts and graphics so that it is extremely easy to see, the iPhone's usability seems to be at the top besting other solutions such as <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=samsung">Samsung</a>'s Blackjack, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=motorola">Motorola</a>'s Q, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=research-in-motion">RIM</a>'s Blackberry and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=palm">Palm</a>'s Treo. I really like what Apple has done by getting rid of the keyboard and the stylus; much like getting rid of the 3.5" floppy drive on the PC side of things.</p>
