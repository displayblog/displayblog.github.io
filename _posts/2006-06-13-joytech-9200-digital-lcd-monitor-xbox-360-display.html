<p>Facts: Joytech&#39;s 9200 Digital LCD Monitor is a 9.2" LCD monitor that sits on top of the Xbox 360 when laid on its side.</p>

<p>Opinion: The 9.2" size is abnormal, but to fit it exactly on the side of the Xbox 360, that&#39;s what Joytech had to do, I guess. After spending $400 on the Xbox 360, I am not sure gamers will want to limit their gameplay on a puny 9.2" screen. I would want the biggest screen that&#39;s around the house or get a new one. The 9.2" screen will most definitely not be able to handle 1280 x 720 content.</p>
