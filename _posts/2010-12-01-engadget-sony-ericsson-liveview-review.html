<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/12/01/sony-ericsson-liveview-review/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[...] This leaves us with the front 1.3-inch OLED display -- which is annoyingly reflective under daylight -- beneath a domed piece of transparent hard plastic [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>Super AMOLED might help in this regard or a nice IPS LCD.</p>
<blockquote><p>[...] the LiveView actually uses the black border as its four-way touch-sensitive navigation controls. Mystery solved.</blockquote></p>
<p>When product design is done well the user manual would go untouched. Not so in this case. You can't touch the OLED display itself. I consider it poorly designed. Simply copying the iPod nano might have been better.</p>
<blockquote><p>Seriously, SE had a lot of potential here, only to be let down by shoddy compatibility -- probably not entirely SE's fault -- and buggy software.</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple should take a close look at LiveView. How about connecting the iPod nano to an iPhone? I pledged to help <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/11/17/lunatik-aerospace-grade-aluminum-ipod-nano-wristwatch-conversion-case/">LunaTik</a> get off the ground. Not everyone will use the iPod nano as a watch but I bet many will be tempted.</p>
