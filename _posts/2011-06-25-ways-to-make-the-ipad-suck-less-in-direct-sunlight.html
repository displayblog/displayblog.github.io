<blockquote><p>Second, Apple needs to do something about the iPad screen&acirc;&euro;&trade;s horrible performance in direct sunlight. I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t know what the solution is &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; whether it could be fixed with a simple mat finish, a direct sunlight mode with a turbo-boost for the brightness or if some entirely new technology is in order. I have the feeling that Amazon&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Android tablet is not only going to be great in direct sun, but will emphasize that fact in TV ads. The iPad&acirc;&euro;&trade;s weakness here is becoming glaringly obvious.</blockquote></p>
<p>Here are some suggestions to make the iPad suck less in direct sunlight: matte, anti-reflective coating, anti-glare coating, transflective (transmissive + reflective) design, higher brightness through more optimal optical film stack and/or brighter more efficient LEDs, optical lamination, etc. These are all doable as in mass-manufacturable at a reasonable cost, today.</p>
