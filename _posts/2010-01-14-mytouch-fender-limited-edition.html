<p>Wood and high tech. Generally these two don't mesh quite well. The myTouch Fender Limited Edition almost pulls it off. Almost. The case looks nice but is most likely just glued veneer, and not real solid wood. A unibody mahogany wood chassis... that would rock. Check out the video at Fender with Eric Clapton with one of these. Source: <a href="http://fender.com/promos/2010/tmobile/">Fender</a></p>
