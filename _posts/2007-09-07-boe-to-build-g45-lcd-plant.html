<p class="P1">BOE Technology Group announced its plans to build a G4.5 LCD plant. BOE Optronics Technology (BOE OT), a branch company of BOE Technology Group who owns 78.54% of BOE OT, will increase the monthly glass input capacity of its G5 LCD fab to 100,000 substrates in 2H'07. Currently, BOE OT's G5 fab has a monthly input capacity of 85,000 glass substrates. The company reported 4.57 million LCD panel shipments in 1H'07.</p></p>
<p class="P1">A G4.5 LCD plant will, at most, be building standard-sized panels for LCD monitors, notebook PCs and portable devices. The investment needed to build a relatively small LCD plant will be significantly less than the mammoth G7 and G8 plants. Also, there are more engineers who can assist in operating a G4.5 plant compared to those with experiences at G7 and G8 plants.</p></p>
