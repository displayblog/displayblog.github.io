<p><strong>Burn-In</strong> PC Magazine's Robert Heron wrote an article titled the same "<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0%2C1895%2C1957216%2C00.asp">Plasma TV Myths</a>". He debunks the "myth" that plasma TVs are prone to phosphor burn-in. He correctly argues that older generation plasma TVs experienced permanent image retention. However, new generation plasma TVs still have phosphor burn-in issues, though the image retention is not permanent--the ghost image will disappear eventually.</p>
<p><strong>Power Consumption</strong> Next, he goes on to debunk the "myth" that plasma TVs consume a lot of power. Well, just the way it is worded makes it extremely difficult to understand what exactly he is trying to debunk. Plasma TVs as well as LCD TVs consume a lot of power, especially as diagonal sizes grow. The main reason is due to the exponential growth of CCFLs that are required to generate certain levels of brightness in large-size LCD TVs. To compare plasma TVs to LCD TVs the best size will be 42" since we see both in the market today. Also, because plasma TV manufacturers have been hoodwinking the consumers by putting "HD" on everything they sell, consumers are deliberately confused. There are four types of plasma pixel formats: ED, XGA, HD, Full HD. The nomenclature can be different from manufacturer to manufacturer but this is what these acronyms mean: ED - 852*480, XGA - 1024*768, HD - 1366*768/1280*720, Full HD - 1920*1080. If I compare plasma TVs and LCD TVs that have 1366*768 pixel formats, without a doubt, a plasma TV will consume more energy than a LCD TV, and by about 30%.</p>
