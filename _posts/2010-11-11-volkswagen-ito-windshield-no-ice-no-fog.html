<p><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2010/11/11/volkswagen-testing-ice-and-fog-free-windshield-technology/">Autoblog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The company has partnered up with the minds at the Fraunhofer Institute to develop a windshield that's resistant to fog, frost and ice. The scientists managed to apply a thin layer of indium tin oxide to the outer layer of the glass, and they say that the compound does a good job of keeping frost from forming all the way down to zero degrees Fahrenheit.</blockquote></p>
<p>Indium tin oxide (ITO) is used in displays to allow for transparent transistors. And now it might be used to keep ice and fog off of our windshields. If this becomes industry standard demand for indium will skyrocket.</p>
