<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=qualcomm">Qualcomm</a> MEMS Technology (QMT) was showcasing a funky-looking device at the SID show currently being held in Los Angeles. The funky-looking device, called SHOW, as it turns out is part of a wireless and mobile security monitoring solution that uses QMT's <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=mirasol">mirasol</a> display and Korea's KT Freetel (KTF) cellular carrier that also happens to use WCDMA, a data transmission standard over cellular connections developed by Qualcomm. QMT's mirasol display sips power so it can last a long time. And because of its reflective design, a mirasol display can be viewed in direct sunlight and in very dark ambient environments as well.</p>

<p>At first, I couldn't wrap my head around it, but think of it this way: the picture above is a WCDMA-connected wireless security camera. You access the camera via a WCDMA-capable <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=mobile-phone">mobile phone</a>. Combine the two and voila! you get mobile security. So why is this a big deal?</p>
<p>KTF is a cellular operator in South Korea and they want to give the mobile phone-toting populous a way to keep an eye on their kids and aging parents. On the front of the brochure that QMT gave me is a grandmother in a wheelchair and with this mobile security solution, you can keep an eye on how she is doing. Some possible applications are:</p>
<li>Small business security system</li>
<li>Daycare facilities to allow parents to check in on their children</li>
<li>Academic environments including library, hallways and exits</li>
<li>Parking lots and car monitoring</li>
<li>Hospital environment for patient monitoring</li>
<li>Common areas in apartment complexes such as weight rooms and laundry facilities</li>
<li>Assisting elderly parents</li>
<li>General asset management: livestock, equipment and storage areas</li>
<p>So imagine having one of these things installed at a daycare. You're wondering how Jr. is doing so you take out your mobile phone, connect to it, and have a look. Pretty cool, I might say. Below is a picture of an example of what you might be able to see:</p>
