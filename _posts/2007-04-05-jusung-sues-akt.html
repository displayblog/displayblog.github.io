<p>Jusung Engineering Co. Ltd. filed a patent infringement lawsuit against US-based Applied Komatsu Technology, Inc. (AKT) and AKT's affiliate A1 Engineering. Jusung is a TFT LCD and semiconductor process equipment manufacturer and competes with AKT in producing plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) systems. The lawsuit was filed in Seoul District Court.</p>
<p>The patent involves the core technology for large-area PECVD and is related to the chamber structure applied in PECVD equipment for LCDs and solar cell equipment.</p>
<p>Earlier in February, AKT sent letters to Jusung's customers in Taiwan that Jusung was infringing AKT's patents and is against the Fair Trade Law. Jusung's request for a lawsuit at the Taipei High Administrative Court was refused on the grounds that the Fair Trade Commission considered AKT's actions as legal.</p>
