<p><a href="http://www.displaymate.com/Surface_Pro_ShootOut_1.htm">Raymond Soneira</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>With the Surface Pro 3 Microsoft has produced an excellent professional grade high performance display for Windows. It has one of the very best and most accurate displays available on any mobile platform and OS, an impressive achievement - for professionals that need a very accurate and high performance display for their work, and for consumers that want and appreciate a really nice and beautiful display. </p>
<p>The Surface Pro 3 delivers uniformly consistent all around Top Tier display performance: it is only the second display to ever to get all Green (Very Good to Excellent) Ratings in all test and measurement categories since we started the Display Technology Shoot-Out article Series in 2006. In addition, the Surface Pro 3 has the most accurate on-screen colors of any Tablet or Smartphone display that we have ever measured.</p>
<p>The Surface Pro 3 is the very first Windows display that has ever reached the Top Tier for displays, which have been the exclusive domain of Android and Apple. There will be considerable interest in this Windows display for that reason.</blockquote></p>
<p>A professional grade display. Interest piqued.</p>
