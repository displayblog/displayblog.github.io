<p align="center">LG Electronics Scarlet LCD TV Specifications</p></p>
<p align="center">Size: 32", 42", 47", 52"<br />Pixel Format: 1920x1080<br />Response Time: 4ms<br />Contrast Ratio: 50,000:1 (dynamic)<br />Frequency: 100Hz (Europe)<br /><br />

<p><a href="http://www.lge.com/about/press_release/detail/PRO%257CNEWS%255EPRE%257CMENU_20814_PRE%257CMENU.jhtml">LG</a>: On April 29, 2008, LG Electronics (LGE) unveiled its Scarlet LCD TV at the Pacific Design Center in Los Angeles. LGE claims that Scarlet is the world's slimmest LCD TV. The Scarlet LCD TV is also known as LG60 and in Europe as LG6000. A 47" model is already available in the UK featuring a pixel format of 1920 x 1080 and 100Hz.</p>
<p>The Scarlet LCD TV is just 1.7" (45mm) thick. Similar to Samsung's Touch of Color design theme, the Scarlet LCD TV has a red-hued black color. The Scarlet incorporates LGE's TruMotion 100Hz technology to reduce motion blur.</p>

<p>Natassia "Scarlet" Malthe was chosen as the celebrity best representing LGE's Scarlet LCD TV. Natassia was chosen for her intelligence, mysterious beauty, and a multicultural background. LGE wanted the Scarlet LCD TV have those qualities and to appeal to a global audience. Interesting.</p>
<p><em>Update 2008.05.14:</em> An industry source informed me today that the Scarlet LCD TV has some very unique design considerations. To make most of the upper portion as thin as possible, the electronics that typically cover the backside of the LCD were shifted down. As a result most of the Scarlet LCD TV is extremely thin and then has a sort of bell-bottom shape as the line progresses downward. This is an outside-the-box design for LG and it is good to see LG take some risky (and sexy!) steps in product design as well as marketing.</p>
