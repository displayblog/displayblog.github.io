<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/26/macbook-air-review-late-2010/">Engadget</a>'s Joshua Topolsky regarding the 2010 MacBook Air notebooks from Apple:</p>
<blockquote><p>Overall, both displays look stunning with wide viewing angles and excellent color reproduction, and we were pleasantly surprised to discover that even though Apple is still going glossy on these displays, the coating used for the new Airs isn't nearly as reflective as those on the MacBook Pros. In fact, the coating seems to have more in common with older MacBooks and Airs, sporting a purple tinge which seems to deaden reflections. We found ourselves far less distracted on these screens, and we're hoping this becomes a trend (or, resumes as a trend).</blockquote></p>
<p>I think it is the Corning Gorilla Glass cover that makes the MacBook Pro displays all the more glossy. I wish there was a way to get rid of it. Not only would it be less glossy the absence of an extra glass layer would reveal the real display. The MacBook Pro would also be lighter. The result would be less glare-based distractions and a lighter unit, both very good things.</p>
