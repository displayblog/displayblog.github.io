<blockquote><p>RealD Inc., a leading global licensor of 3D technologies, and Samsung Electronics LCD Business announced today that they have completed a license agreement to make available to consumer electronics manufacturers panels featuring a new jointly developed 3D display technology, which delivers full resolution 3D images to each eye utilizing RealD 3D cinema glasses.</blockquote></p>
<p>James Cameron:</p>
<blockquote><p>RealD and Samsung's new displays look fantastic and represent the next step in 3D home entertainment. Full resolution viewing is key to experiencing 3D as a filmmaker intended, and when combined with the comfort and practicality of RealD 3D cinema glasses, this display technology will set a new standard for 3D in the home.</blockquote></p>
