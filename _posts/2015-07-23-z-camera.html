<p>The <a href="http://www.z-cam.com/index.php?r=en/index/index">Z Camera</a> is claimed to be the world's smallest interchangeable lens Micro Four Thirds (MFT) 4K camera. Think of it as a Go Pro with a MFT image sensor and interchangeable lenses. <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2081787381/e1-camera-4k-uhd-interchangeable-lens-camera/description">Renamed E1, it's on Kickstarter, and ends August 15, 2015</a>. Looks good, but I can't help but think Panasonic, Olympus, or Go Pro might simply purchase the company.</p>
