<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/07/plastic-logic-que-proreader-in-depth-video-hands-on/">Engadget</a>: Paul Miller took the QUE proReader from Plastic Logic for a spin and came away with some observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solid interface.</li>
<li>Very responsive touchscreen keyboard.</li>
<li>Near perfect functionality.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>I'm not sure I like the cluttered UI. A bunch of large icons representing Excel, PowerPoint, USA Today, etc. are available for you to touch (for about a 1/2 second to make sure). I think Plastic Logic can tidy up that front page a bit. The overall menu system could add a touch more simplicity and elegance. Speaking of touch... touch responsiveness is quite slow at around 1 second, which I think is a bit too long to make it a productive tool. That E Ink delay is barely adequate for reading without having the delay disrupt the pleasure of reading. The QUE proReader seems to be a solid first attempt by Plastic Logic but I think there's a lot more work to be done if these ereaders are to be picked up by professionals needing to get work done.</p>
