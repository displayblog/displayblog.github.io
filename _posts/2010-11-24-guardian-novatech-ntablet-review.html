<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/nov/23/novatech-ntablet-review#">Guardian.co.uk</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Turns out that a lot - and I mean a <em>lot</em> - of the interface elements on Windows are simply too small once you put them on a 10.1" screen to be easily controlled. They're too close together to avoid accidental taps; back buttons are too close to home buttons, the close/minimise/expand window widgets that you're so used to are just a finger smudge apart, and it turns into a vicious game in which you have to plan your angle of attack if you're going to hit the button you want.</p>
<p>Worse comes, though, when you try to do things like browsing and emailing - the two processes that we take as the essentials of most tablet use, or at least of basic Windows functionality.</blockquote></p>
<p>Windows 7 and tablets just don't go together. That's why Apple didn't simply mash its Mac OS X into the iPad.</p>
