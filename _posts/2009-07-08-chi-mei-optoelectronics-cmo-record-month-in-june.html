<p>How is the outlook for others such as LG Display, Samsung, Sharp and Panasonic? Samsung's LCD arm will surely continue to do well supporting new LCD TV models from Samsung Electronics, despite <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/06/23/led-tv/">my aversion to the company's marketing tactics regarding the term "LED TV"</a>. Other companies, I am not too sure. LG Display is aligned mostly with LG Electronics, which in my opinion isn't the hottest brand in the US and generally a bit on the expensive side. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/07/07/sharp-introduces-le700-series-led-backlit-lcd-tvs/">Sharp just announced new LED backlit LCD TVs</a>, but it is late to the game and the prices do not seem to reflect the state of the world's economy. Panasonic's large plasma investment will come to bite them, hard: <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/05/12/power-consumption-lcd-vs-plasma/">plasma TVs tend to consume considerably more power than similar-sized LCD TVs</a> and consumers are very concerned about being green. Plasma TVs are also relatively thick compared to LCD TVs with edge-lit LED backlights.</p>
