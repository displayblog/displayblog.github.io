<blockquote><p>Based on our extensive Lab tests and measurements, the Galaxy S5 is the Best performing Smartphone display that we have ever tested. It has a long list of new records for best Smartphone display performance including: Highest Brightness, Lowest Reflectance, Highest Color Accuracy, Infinite Contrast Ratio, Highest Contrast Rating in Ambient Light, and smallest Brightness Variation with Viewing Angle. The Galaxy S5 has raised the bar for top display performance up by another notch &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; an impressive achievement for OLED technology!</blockquote></p>
<p>Having low reflectance on a smartphone is important because it makes using a smartphone out in the sun a lot easier, hence the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;highest contrast rating in ambient light&acirc;&euro;¬ù record.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Galaxy S5 Cinema Mode has the most accurate colors for any Smartphone or Tablet display that we have ever measured. This is especially important when viewing photos from family and friends (because you often know exactly what they actually should look like), for some TV shows, movies, and sporting events with image content and colors that you are familiar with, and also for viewing online merchandise, so you have a good idea of exactly what colors you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re buying and are less likely to return them.</blockquote></p>
<p>I enjoy taking photos and color accuracy is critical to me. It is hard to imagine a display that's significantly better than what's in the iPhone 5s; I'll have to take a look at the Samsung Galaxy S5 with my own eyes and see if I like it or not.</p>
<p>I've often shared on DisplayBlog that the display <em>is</em> the smartphone or tablet. Ray does mention contrast and color saturation are slightly high, and that could be a deal breaker for me, but if what Ray is saying is true, and I have no doubt it is, Samsung has focused on what is most important on a smartphone and came out ahead of the competition with the Galaxy S5.</p>
