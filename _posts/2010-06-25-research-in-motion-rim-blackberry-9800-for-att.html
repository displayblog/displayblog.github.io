<p>No one outside of RIM knows for sure what the name of the BlackBerry 9800 will eventually be, but what we do know is this full QWERTY slider that slides down in portrait mode looks quite good. And because it is a slider you get a full-sized display. The BlackBerry 9800 seems to be running a slightly refined BlackBerry 6 OS with a bit of 3D added for good measure. WCDMA bands I, II, V and VI are supported and that means the BlackBerry 9800 will be good pretty much the world over. Photos over at <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/24/exclusive-blackberry-9800-for-atandt-fully-exposed/">Engadget</a>. RIM just announced that it has sold more than 100 million BlackBerry smartphones (read <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/24/research-in-motion-rim-100-million-blackberry-smartphones-sold/"><em>Research In Motion (RIM): 100 Million BlackBerry Smartphones Sold</em></a> for more info).</p>
