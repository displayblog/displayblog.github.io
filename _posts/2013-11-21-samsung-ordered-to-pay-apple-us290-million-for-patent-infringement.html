<blockquote><p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;For Apple, this case has always been about more than patents and money,&acirc;&euro; Apple said in a statement to AllThingsD. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;It has been about innovation and the hard work that goes into inventing products that people love. While it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s impossible to put a price tag on those values, we are grateful to the jury for showing Samsung that copying has a cost.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>Samsung owes Apple a total of US$929.83 million.</p>
