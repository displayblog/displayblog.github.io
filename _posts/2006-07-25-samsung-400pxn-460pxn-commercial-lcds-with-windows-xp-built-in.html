<p>Samsung has embedded Windows XP into these two LCD monitors with 40" and 46" sizes. Both sizes have a low pixel count at only 1366 x 768, a response time of 8ms, a 800:1 contrast ratio and a brightness of 500 cd/m2. Average to below-average specifications, especially in the brightness category. Viewing angles are 170 degrees all around and includes HDMI, RGB, S-Video and component video in.<br />
Samsung's MagicNet network technology allows a network computer to push media files such as videos, documents, pictures, and music to these monitors. Another cool feature of these monitors are built-in Ethernet ports.</p>
<p>Get rid of the VGA ports, DVI ports, HDMI ports, all of them to connect video to the computer. Instead, use Ethernet. Ethernet is simpler, lighter, cheaper. At Gigabit Ethernet speeds (1000 mbps = 125 mBps), there's plenty of room to send Full HD to the monitor.</p>
