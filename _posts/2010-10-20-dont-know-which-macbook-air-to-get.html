<p>Meander to Marco.org and read Marco Arment's excellent post titled, "<a href="http://www.marco.org/1361316116">The new MacBook Air</a>":</p>
<blockquote><p>The base 13&acirc;&euro;¬ù model at $1299 is compelling.</p>
<p>For all configurations, I highly suggest the 4 GB built-to-order RAM option for the extra $100. <strong>You can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t upgrade the RAM later.</strong> It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s permanently mounted, like the first Air. The original Air&acirc;&euro;&trade;s 2 GB RAM limit significantly impeded its performance, and even with SSDs, you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll notice performance issues when you hit that wall.</blockquote></p>
<p>The new MacBook Air will most likely work as a solid secondary computer, but I would recommend staying away if you're thinking of making it your primary: it simply isn't powerful enough, unless all you do is check email and browse the Internet. In that case I would recommend the much more affordable iPad.</p>
