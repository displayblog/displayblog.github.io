<blockquote><p>Although Sony's created something more appealing than most Android phones, the Z1S is simply not progressive enough. I love the fact that the phone is completely waterproof but there are too many other faults like the faux-metal frame, factory-installed screen protector, and the terrible 5" display. It's also worth commenting that the design of the phone is okay but there's no dodging the fact that it's essentially a poorly executed iPhone 4.</blockquote></p>
<p>I've read other reviews that point out washed out colors and not so great viewing angles. Sony has been able to manufacture pretty decent smartphones with universally sub-par displays, which is surprising to me because the company has mastered almost every skill necessary to put beautiful pixels on a screen. Sony does quite well on big screens; why the company doesn't do just as well on little ones is a mystery to me.</p>
