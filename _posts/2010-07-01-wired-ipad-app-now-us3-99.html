<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11599" style="margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" title="Wired_Magazine_UK_July_2010" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Wired_Magazine_UK_July_2010.jpg" alt="" width="315" height="430" />Wired's first iPad app, the digital version of the June issue, was $4.99. The second issue, the July issue, is cheaper now at $3.99, retroactive to the June issue. The June issue sold 95,000 copies. Cond&Atilde;&copy; Nast is experimenting with digital magazine pricing and will continue for the next several months. The company definitely should since most of the customer reviews on the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wired-magazine/id373903654?mt=8">Wired Magazine's iPad iTunes page</a> are complaints about pricing. Logically there is no reason why the digital version should be more expensive than the physical one; the digital version should be much <em>much</em> less, say $4.99. For a year's subscription. Comes to about 50% of the print edition.</p>
