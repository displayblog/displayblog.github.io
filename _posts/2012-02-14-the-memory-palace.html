<blockquote><p>Here&acirc;&euro;&trade;s another technique that isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t so well known. I attribute it to Carlton Fisk by way of a story I heard from the baseball writer Roger Angell. Somewhere in the 2000s, Angell asked Fisk to reflect on what had most altered the game of baseball since his playing days. The salaries? The drugs?</p>
<p>No. The game-changer, Fisk said, was instant replay. His game-winning 1975 home run is one of most-remembered moments in all of sports. The <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=19792129&c_id=mlb">video</a> of that event is one of the most-watched clips. You might think that Carlton Fisk has seen that clip a million times. But in fact, he told Roger Angell, he never watches it. That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s because he doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t want to overwrite the original memory, which is his alone, recorded from a point of view that was his alone, with a memory we all share that was recorded by a camera up in the stands.</blockquote></p>
<p>My take is this: If you think what you are experiencing at the moment is so important that you don't want to ever forget it, don't pull out your camera. Instead be completely in the moment and burn that memory into your brain, your heart, and forever remember it.</p>
