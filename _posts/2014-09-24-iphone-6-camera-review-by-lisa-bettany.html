<p><a href="http://snapsnapsnap.photos/how-does-the-iphone-6-camera-compare-to-previous-iphone-cameras/">Lisa Bettany</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even though they share the same 8-megapixel CMOS sensor and five-element f/2.2 lens, after a few days of shooting with the iPhone 6, I can say that it is better than the iPhone 5S. With Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s new Focus pixels sensor feature and advancements made in noise reduction algorithms and local tone mapping, I do see significant improvements to low light and details in shadowed areas.</blockquote></p>
<p>Looking forward to Bettany&acirc;&euro;&trade;s iPhone 6 Plus camera review.</p>
