<p>[ <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/8/13/9148103/gear-s2-smartwatch-first-look-announcement-september">The Verge</a> ] Samsung combined a perfectly circular display, a minimal bezel without protruding buttons (an all-touch UI?), and equally simple watch faces. There are only a few teaser images, but I like what I'm seeing.</p>
<p><i>Update: 2015.09.01</i> <a href="http://global.samsungtomorrow.com/samsung-comes-full-circle-with-introduction-of-samsung-gear-s2/">Samsung officially announced the Gear S2</a>. There are buttons, two: Home and Back. Makes sense. The bezel rotates, a cool feature borrowed from some high-end sports mechanical watches. The Gear S2 comes in two varieties: Gear S2 and Gear S2 classic. The non-classic Gear S2 sports a more modern, minimalisstic design compared to the Gear S2 classic, which looks a bit more like a regular mechanical watch. The display is a 1.2-inch circular (360 degrees) OLED display with a pixel format of 360x360 good for a resolution of 302 ppi. Both versions have 3G options. Battery life is 2 to 3 days. The non-classic Gear S2 looks like it came from the future; itching to try one out.</p>
