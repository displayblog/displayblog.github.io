<p>The National Press Photographers Association's general counsel <a href="http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/14/criminalizing-photography/">Mickey H. Osterreicher</a> spoke with James Estrin, The New York Times:</p>
<blockquote><p>Literally every day, someone is being arrested for doing nothing more than taking a photograph in a public place. It makes no sense to me. Photography is an expression of free speech.</p>
<p>Since 9/11, there&acirc;&euro;&trade;s been an incredible number of incidents where photographers are being interfered with and arrested for doing nothing other than taking pictures or recording video in public places.</p>
<p>It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not just news photographers who should be concerned with this. I think every citizen should be concerned. Tourists taking pictures are being told by police, security guards and sometimes other citizens, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Sorry, you can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t take a picture here.&acirc;&euro; When asked why, they say, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Well, don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t you remember 9/11?&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>I remember it quite well, but what does that have do to with taking a picture in public? It seems like the war on terrorism has somehow morphed into an assault on photography.</blockquote></p>
