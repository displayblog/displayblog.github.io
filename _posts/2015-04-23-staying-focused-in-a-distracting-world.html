<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/06/the-art-of-paying-attention/309312/">The Atlantic</a>'s James Fallows interviews Linda Stone:</p>
<blockquote><p>The generation that has been tethered to devices serves as a cautionary example to the next generation, which may decide this is not a satisfying way to live. A couple years ago, after a fire in my house, I had a couple students coming to help me. One of them was Gen X and one was a Millennial. If the Gen Xer&acirc;&euro;&trade;s phone rang or if she got a text, she would say &acirc;&euro;&oelig;I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m going to take this, I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll be back in a minute.&acirc;&euro; With the Millennial, she would just text back &acirc;&euro;&oelig;L8r.&acirc;&euro; When I talked to the Millennial about it, she said, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;When I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m with someone, I want to be with that person.&acirc;&euro; I am reminded of this new thing they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re doing in Silicon Valley where everyone sticks their phone in the middle of the table, and whoever grabs their phone first has to treat to the meal.</blockquote></p>
