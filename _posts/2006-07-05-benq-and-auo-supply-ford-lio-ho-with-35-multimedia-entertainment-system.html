<p>Ford Lio Ho Motor Co. is the Chinese subsidiary of Ford. FYI, AUO is an affiliate of BenQ with the same chairman running the show, K.Y. Lee. Recently, Ford Lio Ho announced the new Tierra Xt compact sedan that was built locally and that an in-car multimedia entertainment system was built by BenQ with the display supplied by AUO. The display is a 3.5" unit (a little small?) and the multimedia system has a USB port, SD memory card slot, Bluetooth capability, phonebook and a normal stereo system with Apple's iPod compatibility via a special adapter cable allowing the user to view pictures and listen to music.
