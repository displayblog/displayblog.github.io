<p>My iPhone 4 replaced my calendar, iPod, digital camera, and is the only thing I carry in addition to my wallet and keys. Google wants to do one better by letting you get rid of your wallet, too, eventually. There are limitations though. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/05/26/google-wallet-nfc">John Gruber</a> explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>But even by Google&acirc;&euro;&trade;s standards, this announcement seems very early. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s &acirc;&euro;&oelig;coming soon&acirc;&euro;¬ù to two cities (New York and San Francisco), on one phone (Nexus S 4G) on one carrier (Sprint).</blockquote></p>
