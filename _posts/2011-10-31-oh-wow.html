<p>Quoted from Mona Simpson's eulogy for her brother Steve Jobs on October 16 at his memorial service at the Memorial Church at Stanford University <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/opinion/mona-simpsons-eulogy-for-steve-jobs.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all">The New York Times</a>:</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>His philosophy of aesthetics reminds me of a quote that went something like this: &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Fashion is what seems beautiful now but looks ugly later; art can be ugly at first but it becomes beautiful later.&acirc;&euro;¬ù</p></p>
<p>Steve always aspired to make beautiful later.</p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>Steve's aspirations led to beautiful, now and later.</p>
