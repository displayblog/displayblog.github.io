<blockquote><p>Feel free to continue believing what you want to believe about how original the iPhone design was (<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/30/3201162/apple-refutes-claim-they-cribbed-notes-from-sony-reveal-prototype">here&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a 2005 design by Apple</a>, another fascinating nugget revealed by this lawsuit), but don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t make the mistake of thinking this &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Sony&acirc;&euro;¬ù mockup was an actual Sony phone or even a Sony concept. It was an Apple concept showing what a Sony phone might look like.</blockquote></p>
