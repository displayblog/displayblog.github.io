<p><a href="http://www.3dathome.org/steering-st4.aspx">3D@Home</a> just released its "Active Shutter Glasses Database" for you to enjoy <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=3d&amp;sa=Search#1348">3D</a>. I didn't know there were so many brands: 3DTV Corporation, i-Art Corporation, I-O Display Systems, VRex, eDimensional, Micro Star International, RealD, Samsung, NVIDIA. Not one looks cool.</p>
