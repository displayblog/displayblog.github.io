<p>Most notebook PCs sport a LCD panel with a 4:3 aspect ratio. You have 15-inch XGA, 15-inch SXGA+, 15-inch UXGA, 14.1-inch XGA, 14.1-inch SXGA+, etc. Now there is a major shift underway. 4:3 is going away and so is the 15:9 wide. Now it's 16:10's turn. A 15:9 aspect ratio on a notebook PC usually means that the LCD panel has a 1280 x 768 resolution. Well, with advances in driver ICs that can drive more TFT lines per chip than before we are seeing the resolution increase to 1280 x 800, a 16:10 aspect ratio. Higher resolutions such as 1680 x 1050 and 1920 x 1200 exist too. Of course, large TVs (20"+) will more or less be 16:9 following the HD picture format.</p>
