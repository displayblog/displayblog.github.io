<p>AU Optronics (AUO) has lowered its utilization rate to 75%. Chi Mei Innolux (CMI) is around 60-65% while Sharp's utilization rate is around 70% but for its 10G line it is just 50%. On the other hand, Samsung and LG Display (LGD) are going forward at full speed at 90%, and will probably grab some market share. LCD panel prices will most likely continue to fall for the time being. With manufacturing cost structures better equipped to weather a downturn in prices Samsung and LGD will compete fiercely and other companies such as AUO, CMI and Sharp will bleed.
