<p><a href="https://store.archos.com/archos-internet-tablet-p-5004.html">Archos</a> &rarr; <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/02/archos-70-internet-tablet-now-shipping-for-279-with-8gb-storag/">Engadget</a>: The Archos 70 Internet Tablet sports a 7-inch multitouch LCD and runs Android 2.2. The 7-inch display is limited to just 800x480 pixels; the Samsung Galaxy Tab is also 7 inches but packs 1024x600 pixels. Also the Archos 70 Internet Tablet is limited to WiFi BGN and does not come with 3G. Another limitation is a big one: no Android Market. And that means you'll need to sideload them. There is one really good thing about this Android tablet from Archos and that's the price: US$279 for the 8GB version. There is a 250GB HDD version that should soon show itself for $350.</p>
