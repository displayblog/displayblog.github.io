<p><a href="http://panasonic.co.jp/corp/news/official.data/data.dir/en111209-5/en111209-5.html">Panasonic</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>An ultra-slim D-shaped design for easy portability</li>
<li>Slim bezel with high viewing quality Quarter HD (QHD) 4.3-inch large organic light emitting diode (OLED) screen</li>
<li>Waterproof and dustproof for ease of handling</li><br />
</ul><br />
The goal for Panasonic's Systems & Communications Company (SNC) is 1.5 million unit sales in Europe during FY2013 (April 2012 - March 2013).</p>
<p>Note: Please indulge me as I rant, but only a bit. I dislike things like qHD. qHD for some inexplicable reason stands for 960x540. Most of us understand there is Full HD and HD and that they are different. Full HD is 1920x1080 and HD is 1280x720. So a quarter of HD or qHD would be 640x360. If companies insist on using these stupid acronyms then at least use the right one: 960x540 should be qFHD. If I had it my way this thing would be referred to as pixel format, not resolution, and would always be spelled out as: ____x___.</p>
