<a href="http://global.samsungtomorrow.com/?p=17699">Samsung Tomorrow</a>: Samsung will showcase its 21.6-inch square LCD with LED backlight during IFA 2012, which will be held in Berlin, Germany from August 31 through September 5. The direct LED backlight consumes 30% less power than regular LCDs, which I assume are those dinosaurs with CCFL backlights. These 1:1 21.6-inch square LCDs sport a 5.5-mm (0.22-in) bezel-to-bezel thickness and are designed to be connected to one another. I'm imagining a huge wall running Metro with each square LCD representing a live tile.</p>
