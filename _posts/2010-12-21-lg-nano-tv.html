<blockquote><p>The LW9500 and LW7700 are two new sets that use new &acirc;&euro;&oelig;nano&acirc;&euro;¬ù LED backlighting technology, a higher quality image over edge-lit options. The screens will range from 47 inches to 60 inches with a 240Hz panel for the LW7700, 480Hz for the LW9500.</blockquote></p>
<p>LG is probably moving to smaller LEDs that allow for more to be crammed into the back. That would enable even more localized dimming resulting in better contrast. Thickness would probably be reduced, too.</p>
