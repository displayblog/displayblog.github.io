<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=mitsubishi">Mitsubishi</a>'s 149 Series LT-46149 is the follow up to its 148 Series LT-46148. The LT-46149 is a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=46"">46"</a> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a> that features many high-end characteristics. For instance, like some of the top-end Sony LCD TVs, the 149 Series sport the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=x.v.color">x.v.Color</a> color gamut, which is much wider than your typical NTSC color gamut. Mitsubishi is also known for its 6-color light engine, a feature that is unique to Mitsubishi among LCD TVs. The six colors are generated by a wide color gamut CCFL (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=wcg-ccfl">WCG-CCFL</a>) and the company touts that it offers more color fidelity relative to colors generated by just three colors, which is typical.</p>
<p>On high-end LCD TV sets, 1080p capability is a given and so is <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=120hz">120Hz</a> or some other method of motion blur reduction. The LT-46149 doesn't disappoint here as it has both. The LCD panel is a 10-bit panel that allows for billions of colors. With a 12-bit video processor, the Plush1080p, Mitsubishi's LT-46149 should impress those who require high levels of color fidelity.</p>
<p>Although there is no doubt that Mitsubishi has incorporated a lot of high-end features into the 149 Series, I doubt that it will have a serious impact on its overall market share of LCD TVs. Why? The pricing is just as high as other top brands such as <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sony">Sony</a> and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=samsung">Samsung</a>. For instance, Sony's excellent KDL-46XBR5 LCD TV with similar features is priced the same at $3299.99. </p>
<p>May I make a small recommendation to Mitsubishi? How about a smaller price.</p>
