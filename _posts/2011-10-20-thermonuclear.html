<p>Steve Jobs as quoted by <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Jobs-questioned-authority-all-apf-1873950574.html">Yahoo</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I will spend my last dying breath if I need to, and I will spend every penny of Apple's $40 billion in the bank, to right this wrong. I'm going to destroy Android, because it's a stolen product. I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this.</blockquote></p>
