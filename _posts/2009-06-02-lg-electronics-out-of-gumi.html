Why? To centralize production and improve management efficiency.</p>
<p>The company will need all the improvements it can get to achieve the goal of selling 18 million LCD TV sets in 2009 despite a weak economy. Centralized production will include costs savings in logistics, human resources and manufacturing.</p>
<p>LGE's production center in Gumi will shift its focus on small/medium-sized LCD panels. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22lg+display%22&amp;sa=Search#1630">LG Display</a> is also focusing on expanding its LCD panel manufacturing from Gumi to Paju, which is just north of Seoul. LGE is also moving its research and development (R&amp;D) personnel, roughly 300, out of Gumi and into Pyeongtaek.</p>
