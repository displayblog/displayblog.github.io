<p><a href="http://www.chimei-innolux.com/opencms/cmo/Investor_relations/financials/quarterly_results.html?__locale=en">Chimei Innolux</a>: Net sales decreased 5% Q/Q to NT$137 billion in the third quarter. The main reason for the decline in net sales is that large-size ASP declined from US$119 to $113. CMI's G8.5 (2200x2500) TFT LCD fab will increase its production from 10K glass substrate input per month in September to 24K in December.</p>
