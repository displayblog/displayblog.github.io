<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8800"  title="Samsung_CL80_14_Megapixel_WiFi_AMOLED_Digital_Camera" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Samsung_CL80_14_Megapixel_WiFi_AMOLED_Digital_Camera.jpg" alt="Samsung_CL80_14_Megapixel_WiFi_AMOLED_Digital_Camera" width="294" height="181" /><strong>AMOLED:</strong> Samsung's CL80 is a 14MP digital camera that packs a 3.7-inch AMOLED display with capacitive touch and haptic feedback. OLED, capacitive touch and haptic: what a potent combination. I hope the experience is just as good as the hardware combination suggests.</p>
<p><strong>WIFI:</strong> One of the biggest challenges of sharing pictures is to get it online. Samsung makes it easy by integrating WiFi into the CL80, which can also record movies at 720p encoded in H.264. Use the "Instant Upload" feature to get your pictures up on Facebook, Flickr, Photobox and Picasa. Vidoes? Uploads to YouTube. Just make sure you're patient and have a lot of time to wait for the videos to upload, ditto for pictures.</p>
<p><strong>CAVEATS:</strong> I'm impressed with how the CL80 looks on the back; it is completely filled with a 3.7-inch AMOLED. But realistically, OLED displays are not known to be all that great when both you and the sun are out. Another thing to watch out for is the high-resolution 14MP image sensor: packing so many pixels into a small sensor means not-so-great images when the sun goes down. And that's just one of the reasons why I decided get a Canon S90, more on that in a later post.
