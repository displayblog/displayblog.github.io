<p>Bianca V&Atilde;&iexcl;zquez Toness, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-07/indians-flaunt-4-year-old-iphones-as-apple-builds-appeal-tech.html">Bloomberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Suresh Subbian, 42, bought an iPhone 4 in June for his wife, paying about 19,500 rupees.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;We don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t want to take a big risk by buying a new model,&acirc;&euro; he said by phone from Chennai. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;I thought I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d buy her a simple model and try it. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s about half the price of a 5s and that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s an important factor.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>Older iPhones like the 4 and 4s are selling well in India because of two reasons: older iPhones are still considered prestigious, and they are more affordable to more.</p>
<p>I would think there's a burgeoning market for used iPhones in India since used iPhones are generally much cheaper than new ones. On Craigslist in Bangalore a used 16GB iPhone 4s is offered at 20,000 rupees (about US$330), about the same price as a new iPhone 4, but still significantly more expensive than used prices in the SF Bay Area (about $150).</p>
