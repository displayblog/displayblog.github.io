<p><a href="http://www.blackboxcase.com/">Blackbox Case</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Light. Strong. Handcrafted in Golden Colorado with love from us to you. Your Blackbox Case is lined with felt for comfort and only weighs as much as a full beer in a glass bottle. Solid Oak construction guarantees that your Apple Macbook Pro will live a life of luxury and safety. Watch out&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; you might fall in love.</blockquote></p>
<p>There are two versions: one that fits the unibody 13.3-inch MacBook Pro and the other that fits the larger 15.4 inch. US$129. There's even an "any reason, any time, any condition" guarantee. Worth it.</p>
<p>I'm just waiting for Chief Dreamer Lance to dream up the 17-inch version...</p>
