<blockquote><p>The results are disturbing. You still get reasonably flexible output options from the iPad and iPhone, and generally speaking, Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s devices are capable of some beautiful visuals. But the output adapters suffer when showing signals that are susceptible to overly-aggressive compression. And the new adapters are unmistakably a step backward, not forward, from what came before.</blockquote></p>
