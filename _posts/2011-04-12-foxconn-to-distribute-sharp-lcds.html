<blockquote><p>Foxconn Electronics (Hon Hai Precision Industry) has reportedly formed a task force aiming to help distribute TFT-LCD panels from Japan-based Sharp, according to industry sources. Foxconn declined to comment.</blockquote></p>
<p>Sharp has suspended its 8G and 10G LCD fabs due to natural gas shortages and normal operations are expected to resume on May 6 at the earliest. Foxconn is OEM to many TV brands including Sony and will no doubt be a positive influence in distributing Sharp LCDs.</p>
