<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/11/21/18-months">John Gruber</a>. <a href="http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/education/switch-to-ebooks-was-an-unmitigated-disaster-says-school-principal-29767084.html">Denise Calnan, Independent.ie</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a letter sent to parents, Mr Gleeson wrote, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;The roll-out of e-learning which involved the use of HP Elite Pads and e-books should have been an exciting and new way of moving forward.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;The HP Elite Pad has proved to be an unmitigated disaster. We have met with HP representatives on a number of occasions to address the issues.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;To ensure stability and continuity of education I have ordered a full set of books for all the students.&acirc;&euro;¬ù</p>
<p>Students experienced problems such as tablets failing to switch on, tablets spontaneously going into sleep mode, devices looping while performing automatic repairs, system board failures and issues with wi-fi.</blockquote></p>
<p>Let's take a quick look at what the press had to say about the HP ElitePad 900. (I am not certain the ElitePad 900 was the exact model &mdash; it's even spelled wrong: Elite Pad? &mdash; Mountrath Community College procured.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/09/hp-elitepad-900-review/">Dana Wollman, Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>All that said, the ElitePad is still a solid tablet in many ways, but it's only at its best when you splurge on the extras.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnet.com/laptops/hp-elitepad-900/4505-3121_7-35474319.html">Dan Ackerman, c|net</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Of all the Windows 8 tablets we've tested to date, or at least the ones with Intel Atom CPUs, the HP ElitePad 900 has the most in-depth ecosystem of add-ons and accessories. Pick the right set for your needs and you can overcome most of the limitations of trying to work on a small, low-power tablet [...]</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://www.laptopmag.com/review/tablets/hp-elitepad-900.aspx">Michael A. Prospero, Laptop</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>And, while the ElitePad 900 gets a lot right, HP hasn't quite perfected the mix. Among the Atom-based Windows 8 business tablets, we prefer the <a href="http://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/tablets/lenovo_thinkpad_tablet_2.aspx">Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet 2</a>, which not only offers better performance, but stylus support and longer battery life. However, HP's slate offers more expansion options. Overall, the HP ElitePad 900 is a good Windows 8 tablet for the price.</blockquote></p>
<p>I've only picked three reviews, but the consensus from all three seems to be the HP ElitePad 900 isn't a terrible Windows 8 tablet. But, and this is a big but, the press has a tendency to go easy on the products they review. I understand why, and that's the reason why I don't post reviews of products unless they are really great. If I post a negative review that means I understand there is the distinct possibility the company will no longer send products to review. That being said Mountrath Community College researched for 18 months to find the right tablet and did not have to rely solely on online reviews of the HP ElitePad. And so I agree with Gruber, research skills were severely lacking, to say it mildly. Or perhaps it was testing skills.</p>
