<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6575" title="Dell_U2410_24inch_IPS_LCD_Monitor" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Dell_U2410_24inch_IPS_LCD_Monitor.jpg" alt="Dell_U2410_24inch_IPS_LCD_Monitor" width="303" height="425" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/08/06/dell-goes-pro-with-u2410-ips-monitor-for-japan/">Engadget</a>: The Dell U2410 is a 24-inch LCD monitor sporting an IPS LCD panel. IPS stands for In-Plane Switching and is generally regarded as a very high-end wide viewing-angle LCD technology that produces very nice colors and exhibits low contrast shifts and color shifts when viewing at wide angles. A lot of professionals use IPS or PVA-based LCD monitors (some still use CRT due to its brilliant color rendering).</p>
<p>The U2410 sports a color gamut of 96-percent Adobe RGB and 100-percent sRGB--great for professionals who need to deal with color. How did Dell do this? Probably by incorporating an IPS LCD panel that uses a Wide Color Gamut CCFL (WCG-CCFL) backlight. WCG-CCFL backlights differ from normal CCFL backlights in that the phosphors inside the CCFL tube have been enhanced to emit light that brings about a wider spectrum of colors.</p>
<p>Since Dell is positioning the U2410 as a high-end LCD monitor for color professionals the resolution remains 1920x1200 with a 16:10 aspect ratio; not the 16:9 1920x1080 that you see on monitors that are geared more toward consumers. I personally lie the additional 120 vertical display real estate. Contrast ratio is a solid 1000:1 and you can expect that not to collapse when viewing at angles.</p>
<p>Connectivity includes DVI, HDMI and DisplayPort. I wish the industry would simply come together on a single standard so we don't go wasting our precious and hard-earned money buying expensive cables every time another "standard" comes out. The U2410 also comes with a 4-port USB hub. The price is on the high side but not incredibly so: JPY72,450 or about US$760.</p>
