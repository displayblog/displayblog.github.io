<p><a href="http://www.cultofandroid.com/2446/friday-night-fights-whats-better-the-3-5-inch-iphone-or-androids-4-inch-superphones/">John Brownlee, Cult of Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a great image that just says loads about Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s attention to detail. As you can see, three-and-a-half inches is the sweet spot for allowing most people to text with a single hand on their touchscreen phone, represented by the green zone on each smartphone. Go above four inches, and you can no longer do that: you have to text on your phone with two hands, Blackberry-style.</blockquote></p>
