<p><a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6032/asus-pa246q-24-proart-monitor">Chris Heinonen, AnandTech</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Getting accurate performance out of the box without needing to spend extra money on hardware is important to many people but it's often very hard to deliver. With their Pro Art monitors, ASUS aims to deliver just that: sRGB and AdobeRGB modes that are reasonably accurate (a dE < 5.0 out of the box), with a full set of controls for users to calibrate it on their own.</blockquote></p>
<p>Specs are impressive: 24.1-inch, 10-bit P-IPS, 1920x1200, 400 nits, CR 50000:1, 6ms GTG, 178/178 viewing angles, and anti-glare. What's not to like? Two things: the CCFL backlight, and unimpressive calibrated results. ~US$469.</blockquote></p>
