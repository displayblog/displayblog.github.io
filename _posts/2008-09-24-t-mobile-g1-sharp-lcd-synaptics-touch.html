<p>T-Mobile's G1 is the first Android smartphone. There has been a LOT of press about it. My initial reaction wasn't too positive but maybe that's because I biased. I used to own an iPhone (G1 and 3G) and will be owning a Moto Q Global smartphone very soon. Despite my less-than-enthusiastic response, I do hope that many developers sign on to Android. I have a feeling that we will be seeing a repeat of history where the open platform of hardware makers and software developers center around Android and bring about a global transition toward true mobile computing. I think Android has a long ways to go to catch up to the iPhone's early start. The area that is most in need of enhancement is of fit and finish both in the OS and in the hardware. One particularly glaring problem, to me at least, is that when you slide the display out to expose the QWERTY keyboard, the display does not seem to be straight and a bit tilted. But maybe that's not that important where even today we see some disparity between regular PCs and beautiful Macs. Of course there are beautiful PCs too, but that's more the exception than the rule. So maybe Android hardware and software need not be polished to be successful if the PC industry's history is any indication.</p>
