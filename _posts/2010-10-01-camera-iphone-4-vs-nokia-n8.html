<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/30/nokia-n8-vs-iphone-4-camera-showdown/">Engadget</a> took the iPhone 4 and the Nokia N8 and took some pictures and videos. The conclusion? The N8 took more neutral and probably more accurate pictures. The photos from the iPhone 4 though they look more pleasant are blown up in terms of saturation. I'll take accuracy over artificial prettiness.</p>
<p>I've been considering the possibility of not having a separate camera and simply using a smartphone, like the iPhone 4, for picture-taking duties. But the more I see iPhone 4 sample photos the more I realize I really do need a nice digital camera.</p>
