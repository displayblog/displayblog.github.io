If you're a proud owner of Canon's latest compact low-light wonder, the S90, you'd be excited to hear that <a href="http://www.lensmateonline.com/newsite/richard_franiec_accessoriesS90.html">Lensmate</a> has something special for you: the Custom Grip.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Custom Grip for the S90 is individually 3D CNC machined from a solid block of aircraft-grade aluminum before being glass-bead blasted, black-anodized and nickel-sealed for durability and good looks.</blockquote><br />
Designed by Richard Franiec the Custom Grip "sits about 1.5 mm lower than the retracted lens, so it does not affect the pocketability of the camera." VHB (very high bond) 3M clear transfer film is used to permanently hold the Custom Grip to the S90. It can also be removed without damaging the finish. Check out all <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/RichardFraniec/2009_10_23?authkey=Gv1sRgCKTKpc2xkKuuvgE#">25 photos</a> of the Custom Grip for the S90: looks absolutely wonderful. And the price is a reasonable US$32.95. Image Source: <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/RichardFraniec/2009_10_23?authkey=Gv1sRgCKTKpc2xkKuuvgE#">Lensmate</a></p>
