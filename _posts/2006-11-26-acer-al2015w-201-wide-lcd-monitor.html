<p>The AL2015W from Acer is the second largest model in the company's Gamer Line; the largest is the AL2251W. The 20.1" wide AL2015W has the following specifications:</p>
<p>Display size: 20.1"<br />
Resolution: 1680 x 1050<br />
Response time: 8ms GTG<br />
Contrast ratio: 800:1<br />
Brightness: 300 cd/m2<br />
Viewing angle: 176/176</p>
<p>The AL2015W also has two speakers rated at 1.5W, which sounds a bit weak even for built-in speakers. The weird thing about Acer's line of monitors is that it has a Performance Line and a Gamers Line. I'm not sure about you, but gamers need all the performance that a monitor can give! From the pictures at Acer, there seems to be a DVI, VGA and RCA video inputs.</p>

<p>The height adjustment mechanism seems to be quite sturdy, at least from the looks of it. There is also an interesting connection box on the rear that will likely make connecting cables to the AL2015W much easier. The 20.1" wide LCD monitor is my sweet spot. The smaller 19" wide LCDs have a lower resolution (1440 x 900) but the larger 22" wide models don't give you any more pixels. You'll need to get to 23" for a nice 1920 x 1200 display but it will also cost you a bit more.</p>
