<p>Sluggish interface? Not surprising. The PPI on the 5.5-inch Galapagos is 215.79, quite high compared to some of the other tablets out there. For instance the iPad sports a resolution of just 131.96 PPI. For more info read <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/09/27/sharp-galapagos/">Sharp Galapagos</a>.</p>
