<p>Samsung is bringing out the 17" 740BX and the 19" 940BX targeted at commercial customers. Both feature 1000:1 contrast ratios, 5ms response times, 1280 x 1024 resolution, 170 degree all-around viewing angles, a VGA and DVI interfaces. These features are not what makes these special, but these are: MagicBright II, MagicColor, and MagicTune.</p>

<p>MagicBright II automatically optimizes brightness and contrasts for particular content such as text, Internet, sports, movies, and games. MagicColor enhances color in two modes: Full that enhances overall color and Intelligent that enhances color while keeping skin tones unchanged. MagicTune allows the user to use the mouse to control picture adjustments on the screen.</p>
<p>I really like the MagicTune feature. I am surprised that it has taken this long! Almost all computers have either a mouse attached or a trackpad and to make use of that simple human-machine interface in the OSD seems obvious, but I guess it wasn't. Kudos to Samsung for bringing to us a better and easier way of interacting with our tools.</p>
