<p><a href="http://conversionxl.com/why-simple-websites-are-scientifically-better/">Tommy Walker, ConversionXL</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The reason less &acirc;&euro;&oelig;visually complex&acirc;&euro;¬ù websites are considered more beautiful is partly because low complexity websites don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t require the eyes and brain to physically work as hard to decode, store and process the information.</p>
<p>Basically, your retina converts visual information from the real world into electrical impulses. Those impulses are then routed through the appropriate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoreceptor_cell">photoreceptor cells</a> to transmit the color and light information to the brain.</p>
<p>The more color and light variations on the page (visual complexity) the more work the eye has to do to send information to the brain.</blockquote></p>
<p>I couldn't agree more.</p>
