<p>Unlike the UK-bound KDL-40W2000 that received the winning nod from <a href="http://www.whathifi.com/">What HiFi? Sound and Vision</a>, the KDL-40XBR3 has three HDMI ports and the BRAVIA Engine Pro. The Engine Pro upconverts HD signals such as 1080i and 720p to 1080p. Any XBR will cost money but a XBR3 will cost even more: plan on spending $3800.</p>

<p>1080p is the future and that's not an exaggeration. Sure, there is that small problem of the lack of 1080p content, but with upconversion technologies like that in the BRAVIA Engine Pro and the soon-to-be-released Sony PlayStation 3 (via Blu-Ray), everyone will clamor to get a TV that can display 1080p at 1080p. I, for one, will not be getting any TV that does not sport a 1920 x 1080 pixel format.</p>
