<blockquote><p>That is, with the iPhone 6 and iOS8, Apple has done its best to close off all the reasons to buy high-end Android beyond simple personal preference. You can get a bigger screen, you can change the keyboard, you can put widgets on the notification panel (if you insist) and so on. Pretty much all the external reasons to choose Android are addressed - what remains is personal taste.</blockquote></p>

There are still a couple of hardware specific non-personal reasons to buy a high-end Android smartphone: 2560x1440 (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/04/22/lg-g3/">LG G3</a>, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/09/03/samsung-galaxy-note-4/">Samsung Galaxy Note 4</a>) and waterproof (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/09/03/sony-xperia-z3/">Sony Xperia Z3</a>).</p>
