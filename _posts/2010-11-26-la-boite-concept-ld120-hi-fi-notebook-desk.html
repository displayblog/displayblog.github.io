<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/26/la-boite-concept-ld120-is-the-hi-fi-desk-your-laptops-been-cryi/">Engadget</a>: French design studio La Boite Concept has integrated seven drivers that includes a down-firing subwoofer, two in the speakers in the rear and four out front into its leather-trimmed LD120 hi-fi notebook desk. With all of those speakers and a USB sound card audio is limited to 2.1. Priced at &acirc;&sbquo;&not;980.</p>
<p>Hmm... I think I would rather make my own and integrate a Yamaha surround sound bar and Creative's best external Sound Blaster and call it a day. The Sound Blaster with the best customer reviews is the SB1090 X-Fi Surround 5.1 going for just $44.99 at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017QQQAE?ie=UTF8&tag=displ0f-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0017QQQAE">Amazon</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=displ0f-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0017QQQAE" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. Yamaha sound bars are a bit more expensive but the YSP-3050BL is highly rated and won't bust your bank account: $560.77 at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BFBAT8?ie=UTF8&tag=displ0f-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001BFBAT8">Amazon</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=displ0f-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B001BFBAT8" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. Use these links and I'll get a small kickback. Happy Black Friday shopping!</p>
