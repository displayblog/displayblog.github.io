<blockquote><p>Apple reportedly has added two more iPad 2 touchscreen suppliers, making five the total number of firms churning out displays for the Cupertino, Calif. firm. Apple expects its iPad 2, believed to appear in early 2011, to sell six million units per quarter, compared to four million quarterly shipments of the current tablet.</blockquote></p>
<p>What?!? Companies that make touch layers are now making the actual displays? Of course not. Cult of Mac just doesn't know that there are companies that make touch screens, LCDs, and both. The touch screen suppliers are: Chimei Innolux (CMI), Cando, Wintek, Sintek Phototronics, and TPK Touch Solutions. The LCD supplier for the iPad 2, as far as I know, is just LG Display.</p>
