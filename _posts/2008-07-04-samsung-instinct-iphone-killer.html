<p>Samsung's Instinct has been billed as an iPhone killer and has been aggressively promoted by Sprint. Sprint has a lot of comparisons with the iPhone. One interesting video compares the Internet speeds. Of course with the iPhone's snail-paced EDGE connection the Instinct trumps it quite easily. This won't be the case when the iPhone 3G becomes available next week on July 11. The added haptic capability allows for a better feedback in addition to audio and visual. The display is just 3.1" with a pixel format of 240 x 432. This is a disappointment as it seems a bit lacking in terms of the number of pixels. The display is also overlayed with plastic while the iPhone is glass, pretty scratch-proof glass at that.</p>

<p>The Instinct can capture video, which is a feature that many smartphones have and the iPhone doesn't.&Acirc;&nbsp; The Instinct also has live TV, which is pretty impressive. GPS is also a feature that allows pin-pointing exact locations and has a 3D perspective. A video makes fun of the iPhone's location service by showing the circle encasing a fairly large area and stating, "Hmmm. Somewhere in this ginormous cirlce." That was pretty funny.</p>

<p>You can also download music from the Instinct and this does not require a WiFi connection, something the iPhone requires. In a sarcastic voice the narrator says, "Can not connect?" This video is also entertaining. I'm giggling as I'm writing this. It is pretty limiting how you must be connected via WiFi to download from the iTunes store. I'd rather have a slow download than nothing.</p>

<p>There are three buttons on the bottom: back, home and phone. Intuitively the back goes back one step, home gets you home and the phone button gets you to phone functions. I like the microSD slot that allows you to add more memory, up to 8GB.</p>

<p>Samsung's Instinct has won a few awards already. "Best in Show" at CTIA Wireless 2008, "Best Cell Phone CTIA" from CNET in April 2008, "Mobile CE Smartphone" winner from CTIA Wireless 2008. All three awards are related to CTIA, but none-the-less, the Instinct is probably the closest competiton that the iPhone has.</p>
<p>Finally, Sprint has an 'everything plan' that gives you unlimited voice and data for just $99.99 per month that include web surfing, GPS navigation, Sprint TV, text, video, e-mail, Sprint Music, etc.</p>
