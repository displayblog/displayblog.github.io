<p><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/tech/when-apple-unveiled-the-iphone-6-last-week-it-97685451544.html">David Pogue</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The screens are terrific. The smaller iPhone 6&acirc;&euro;&trade;s screen has 1334 &Atilde;&mdash; 750 pixels (326 dots per inch), and the Plus&acirc;&euro;&trade;s screen is 1920 &Atilde;&mdash; 1080 pixels (401 dpi), which is full high definition. Other phones have more dots or smaller ones, but at this point, everybody is just chasing unicorns; these screens have long since exceeded the ability of our eyes to distinguish pixels.</blockquote></p>
<p>David, it is pixels per inch (ppi). And nope, folks who know a lot about eyes say our eyes can distinguish pixels at far denser resolutions than 300 ppi. But you are right, those of us who are over 40 will most likely not be able to tell the resolution difference between the 401-ppi iPhone 6 Plus and the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/06/10/lg-g3-space-efficient/">538-ppi LG G3</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>There&acirc;&euro;&trade;s now ultra-smooth, ultra-slow motion video (see the watermelon-smashing test in my video, above). There&acirc;&euro;&trade;s phase-detection autofocusing, which compares incoming light from two pixels for fast, precise focusing &mdash; or quick, smooth refocusing while recording video (hallelujah!).</p>
<p>The Plus model has optical image stabilization &ndash; the lens jiggles in precise motion to counteract the handheld movement of the phone itself &ndash; that works supremely well.</blockquote></p>
<p>Phase detection autofocus is used by most DSLRs precisely because of how fast it can autofocus. However, the slower contrast detection autofocus is more accurate. Some advanced cameras use both. I understand why Apple focused on speed: iPhones have not had problems with accurate focusing, but they have had problems with focus speeds. No more with the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Real time autofocusing while recording video is a feature a lot of us will enjoy using.</p>
