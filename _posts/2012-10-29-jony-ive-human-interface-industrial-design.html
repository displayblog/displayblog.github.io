<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/10/29Apple-Announces-Changes-to-Increase-Collaboration-Across-Hardware-Software-Services.html">Apple</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jony Ive will provide leadership and direction for Human Interface (HI) across the company in addition to his role as the leader of Industrial Design. His incredible design aesthetic has been the driving force behind the look and feel of Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s products for more than a decade.</blockquote></p>
<p>I look forward to not having to use apps like ShadowKiller to inject a bit of minimalism into OS X. Can't wait to see what Ive will do with OS X and iOS. By the way, Scott Forstall and John Browett got the boot; <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/10/forstall_out">John Gruber explains</a>.</p>
