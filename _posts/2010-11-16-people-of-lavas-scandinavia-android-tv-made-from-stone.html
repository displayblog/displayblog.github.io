<p><a href="http://www.peopleoflava.com/television/scandinavia/specifications/">People of Lava</a> &rarr; <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/11/worlds-first-android-tv-made-of-rock-weighs-90-pounds/">Wired</a>: The Scandinavia is the name of the TV made by People of Lava, which is a company based in Sweden. The Scandinavia is made in Sweden and will come in three sizes: 42, 47, 55 inch. </p>
<p>There are two things that make the Scandinavia very interesting. One is that it is made of metal, glass, and stone. Weight? 90 pounds for the 55-inch version.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Scandinavia TV is the first home electronics product to use this material, which otherwise is mainly found in exclusive kitchens and yachts.</blockquote></p>
<p>The second feature is that it is the world's first Android-based TV. Although the version of Android is less-than appealing: 1.5, customized to fit on a really big display. The three displays all sport LED backlights and a 1920x1080 pixel format.</p>
<p>The 42-inch Scandinavia can be pre-ordered for 22,000 Swedish Krona. That amounts to more than US$3500. The 55-inch version will cost 40,000 Krona. I would make sure that your wall is thoroughly reinforced before mounting one of these Scandinavia Android TVs.</p>
