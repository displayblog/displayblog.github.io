<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/11/htc-7-pro-first-hands-on/">Engadget</a> regarding the HTC 7 Pro's five-row QWERTY keyboard:</p>
<blockquote><p>... with clicky keys, a dedicated number row, and a properly staggered layout for once. As for the slider mechanism, it's quite sturdy, and we're definitely digging HTC's good old tilt capability, here in its finest iteration yet ... here the front lip actually sinks into the phone's frame for extra stability and class.</blockquote></p>
<p>The HTC 7 Pro packs a 3.6-inch 800x480 LCD. The tilted screen as well as five rows of keys will certainly excite folks who thumb-type a lot. Maybe it isn't an important design consideration for most but for me the offset display is always an eyesore.</p>
