<p><a href="http://bo.ipapercms.dk/Catalogue/Golden/">B&amp;O</a>: Bang &amp; Olufsen (B&amp;O) has got gold fever. The company has just launched its "golden colour" versions of its products and billed them as, "The perfect complement for the most luxurious surroundings." I'm not sure that the timing is right. Nor am I sure about the color gold.</p>
