<p>This ad for the new Google Nexus S is disorienting. I wasn't able to watch it through. According to <a href="http://adage.com/digital/article?article_id=147495">Advertising Age</a> the ad was a collaboration between California-based Muhtayzik-Hoffer and 1stAveMachine. The Nexus S website is done well enough, quite Apple-like actually (read: <a href="http://bradwallen.com/2010/12/06/google-nexus-s/">Google Nexus S</a> by Brad W. Allen), but this YouTube ad is lame.</p>

<blockquote><p>Funny enough, this is almost the exact opposite pitch that Microsoft is making with Windows Phone 7.  Microsoft says you can get in and out quickly with your phone. Google says stay lost in your phone.</blockquote></p>
<p>In-N-Out. LOST. Who cares. Just get the best phone for what you need it for. For me it happens to be the iPhone.</p>
