<p>Scott Kleinberg of <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/blogs/iphone-therefore-iblog/2010/10/apple-store-lincoln-park-sneak-peek.html">Chicago Now</a> got a sneak peek at the new Apple Store located at Lincoln Park, Chicago right outside the North and Clybourn Red Line station. It's also a Significant Store, Apple's fourth following Shanghai, Paris, and London. The combination of aluminum, glass and wood is simply beautiful.</p>
<p>Apple struck a deal with the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) and transformed the once crappy area into an appealing destination. The investment? US$3.9 million. The Lincoln Park Apple Store opens Saturday at 10am. Apple is giving out 4000 t-shirts.</p>
