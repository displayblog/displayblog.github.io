<blockquote><p>The One X's display is, without a hint of hyperbole, the best I've ever seen on a phone. Full stop. Seriously, I'm struggling to find fault with it in any way: it's got a near-perfect 180 degree viewing angle and perhaps the most accurate color reproduction and color temperature available. At 720p, it falls well into "retina" territory where the individual pixels become invisible to the naked eye. It also lacks the infamous pentile subpixel arrangement commonly employed on high-resolution AMOLEDs like that found on the One S, and it runs circles around the Galaxy Nexus's 4.65-inch Super AMOLED for overall quality.</blockquote></p>
<p>The HTC One X sports a 4.7-inch 1280x720 Super LCD 2 good for a resolution of 312.47 ppi. I'll wait on proper test results to see if the One X sports <em>the</em> best smartphone display, but this is some high praise. Good stuff.</p>
