<p>HP really wants to get into your living room by way of cool TVs. I don't necessarily associate HP with the word 'cool' when it comes to things like TVs, but <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1984238,00.asp">PC Magazine</a> sure thinks it's a great TV. The TV is a $3500 58" DLP that sports full 1920 x 1080, so it is future proof when and if the cable and satellite guys come to their senses and realize that quality is much more important than quantity. I was over at my relatives where they have cable TV and after going through several dozen channels, there was nothing that I wanted to watch, except for the NYM vs NYY baseball game.</p>
<p>The md5880n unit has component, composite, HDMI, RF and S-Video inputs in addition to analog VGA. It has two build-in TV tuners: NTSC and ATSC. The NSTC tuner will become useless in the next few years, but I guess it might be interesting to see if there are any rogue NTSC-based broadcasts after it is turned off by the US government. It also has a CableCard slot that seems to have a lack of support by all cable outfits in the US. At least one of my friends seem to think so: when he purchased a CableCard-ready HD set, his cable company was less then enthusiastic about helping him. I guess cable companies still like to push those ugly boxes, probably because they've somehow paid for them already.</p>
<p>The HP unit has a black matte finish so you won't need to wear sunglasses to get away from reflections. A unique design touch is the really thin upper border. I'm not sure if I like it, but it's unique and I seemed to have seen this type of design in only one other brand: RCA. The md5880n is a good price with a good design and incorporates some high-end video capabilities. Nice job HP.</p>
