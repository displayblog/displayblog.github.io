<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/12/5804410/samsung-galaxy-tab-s-announcement-price-availability">Dan Seifert, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Samsung&acirc;&euro;&trade;s big selling point with the Tab S line are the new Super AMOLED displays, and well, they look pretty fantastic. The Tab S line has the largest Super AMOLED displays Samsung has ever used in a mobile device, and they are the first tablets since <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/3/22/2892430/samsung-galaxy-tab-7-7-for-verizon-review">2012&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Galaxy Tab 7.7</a> to use the technology. Samsung boasts that the 2560 x 1600 pixel AMOLED screens offer 20 percent better color range and 100 times better contrast ratio than comparable LCDs. In person, they are very bright and very vibrant, though they still exhibit the over-saturated look anyone that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s used a Galaxy S smartphone can relate to. Samsung is including some software tools to tweak colors and brightness, which help make the displays easier to look at while reading. But really, Samsung designed these for watching video, and for that they look great.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Galaxy Tab S comes in two sizes: 8.4 and 10.5, both with 2560x1600 pixels.</p>
