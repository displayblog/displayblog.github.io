<blockquote><p>In Q1&acirc;&euro;&trade;12, panel makers are expecting to increase glass input by 5%, to 39.8 million square meters. The forecast capacity utilization is 77% in Q1&acirc;&euro;&trade;12, which is 7% higher than previously expected. This is partly based on expectations that prices have bottomed out in this cycle. Also, panel makers are planning for new models, such as larger size multi-function monitor panels, ultra-slim notebook PC panels, new TV panel sizes including 39&acirc;&euro;W, 43&acirc;&euro;W, 48&acirc;&euro;W and 50&acirc;&euro;W with cost effective CCFL and LED backlights, and slim bezels. However, with 2012 market demand still unclear, panel makers foresee the possibility of adjusting capacity utilization again in Q1&acirc;&euro;&trade;12.</blockquote></p>
<p>It seems LCD manufacturers are expecting a strong rebound in end user demand for LCD goods in Q2'12. Among the new things LCD manufacturers are getting excited over "ultra-slim notebook PC panels" might be the only thing mentioned that has a good chance of generating some demand in Q2'12. A big omission: high resolution tablet panels.</p>
