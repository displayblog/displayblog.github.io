<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lg-display">LG Display</a> showcased many LCD innovations including this <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=4.3"">4.3"</a> multitouch LCD sporting a pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=800-x-480">800 x 480</a>. I am scratching my head and wondering if this could be the LCD that might be in <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=apple">Apple</a>'s <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=iphone">iPhone</a> 2.0. The first iPhone has a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=3.5"">3.5"</a> LCD but there is too much border around the top portion where the sound comes out (when you're on the phone and not using the speakerphone feature). The single button on the bottom doesn't have to be that big since it's the only button you can push on the front of the iPhone. If there were many other buttons, you'd have to make them big enough so you don't accidentally push the wrong buttons. But there's just one, so you can make it smaller. Make the borders on the top and bottom a bit smaller and voila! you can fit a 4.3" LCD in there.</p>
<p>With this 4.3" you get a pixel format of 800 x 480 (3.84K pixels), more than twice as many pixels than what was on the iPhone 1.0 (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=480-x-320">480 x 320</a>, 1.536K pixels). Although the ideal number of pixels would be 1024 for optimum Internet browsing, 800 is going in the right direction. Bear in mind, I'm just conjecturing (and hoping!) here. 800 x 480 would also make viewing DVD-quality movies downloaded from the iTunes Music Store a much better experience. I can imagine it being REALLY good. And don't forget, this little 4.3" by LG Display has <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=multitouch">multitouch</a> capability built-in. Ah, the possibilities!</p>
