<blockquote><p>In the display segment, Corning expects combined glass volume in the second quarter to be consistent with the first quarter. Glass volume for the company&acirc;&euro;&trade;s wholly owned business is anticipated to decline in the low- to mid-teen range sequentially, primarily the result of lower utilization rates at several customers. At Samsung Corning Precision, volume is expected to increase in the low- to mid-teen range for the quarter. Glass price declines are expected to continue to moderate.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Display Technologies segment sales increased 5% Q/Q to US$790 million. As Corning expected LCD glass substrate prices declined more moderately than in Q4'10. Samsung procures a significant portion of SCP's LCD glass capacity.</p>
<p>James Flaw, Vice Chairman and CFO at Corning, expects a significant bump in LCD glass demand in the third quarter due to Sharp resuming production.</p>
