  and <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sony\">Sony</a> were
  first. Apple stuck it in the <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=macbook\">MacBook</a>
  while Sony also used it for its SZ model notebook PCs. At that time HP was in the
  14.x\" wide TFT LCD bandwagon and came forth with its dv notebook PC models. Personally,
  I prefer the slightly smaller 13.3\" size. Now HP has a 13.3\" notebook PC too:
  the Pavilion dv3500t. The dv3500t is HP's first 13.3\" notebook PC. One really cool
  thing that I like about the dv3500t is the <em>name</em> of the color: Liquid
  Metallic Bronze. Reminds of the awesome Terminator made out of liquid metal: T1000.
  I just like the name; I'm not really into bronze-colored high-tech gadgets. "

<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=13.3"">13.3"</a> wide TFT LCDs have been used in <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=notebook-pc">notebook PC</a>s for quite some time.

<p>The 13.3" LCD panel comes in two varieties: one with a regular CCFL backlight and the optional <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led-backlight">LED backlight</a>. HP puts in the term "High-Definition" for these LCDs. Though technically they are not incorrect, don't be fooled into thinking that you'll be able to watch <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1080p">1080p</a> high-definition content on the dv3500t at its full native format. The <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1280-x-800">1280 x 800</a> pixel format is not capable. Instead, you'll be watching an awfully scaled down (I do not know of any notebook PC that has a good scaler built-in) version. Stick to <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=720p">720p</a> content and you should be fine. Where do you find 720p content? The largest source of 720p content to my knowledge is <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/">Apple's Quicktime movie trailer site</a>. The display is driven by NVIDIA's GeForce 9300M GS with 512MB. That's good because the <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/gb/inquirer/news/2008/07/09/nvidia-g84-g86-bad">GeForce 84 and 86 series GPUs are bad</a> and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/10/10/apple-says-some-macbook-pros-hit-by-faulty-nvidia-chips/">Apple fessed up to it that its MacBook Pros with those GPUs are bad and will be taken care of</a>.</p>
