<p><a href="http://en.akihabaranews.com/81623/displays/lg-electronics-announces-new-gaming-monitor">Akihabara News</a>: The LG E2370V makes use of a 23-inch 1920x1080 UH-IPS LED-backlit LCD panel. Unfortunately I have no idea what UH stands for, but the LCD sports the typically excellent 178/178 viewing angles. Gamers rejoice: Thru Mode eliminates signal input lag, which is equivalent to certain death in FPS games. Connectivity options include HDMI, VGA, and DVI-D. The bezel is 19-mm (0.75-inch) thick and is touted as being thin: I'd like to see them thinner. The E2370V is an interesting proposition since IPS technology provides exceptional color fidelity but doesn't sport the fastest response times. Maybe LG Display found a solution in the UH part of IPS. Pricing is expected to be around US$400.</p>
