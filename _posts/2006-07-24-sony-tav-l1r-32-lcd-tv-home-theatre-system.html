<p>The TAV-L1/R is a new type of all-in-one audio-video device from Sony that incorporates a 32" LCD TV with a home theatre system. The 32" LCD TV sports 1366 x 768 resolution and does not come with a TV tuner (not quite an all-in-one). And with all the rage about 1080p, Sony seems to have missed something. There are plenty of 37" LCD TVs that have 1920 x 1080 resolution and that would have been the better choice, better yet, a 40" with 1920 x 1080.</p>

The part about the S-Master digital amplier that slides up and down to conceal/reveal the LCD TV is really not necessary. When do you really need to conceal the TV? My idea of listening to music is to have digital surround sound but also a HD music video going along with it. How nice would that be!</p>
<p>The TAV-L1/R sports two HDMI inputs, dual subwoofers, Dolby Prologic II and DTS decoding with video signal inputs of 480i, 480p, 1080i and 720p. Forget 1080i input because that will require scaling which will deteriorate the video signal. Also don't even think about 480 anything: it will look horrible due to massively scaling up. Make sure to get a 720p signal through ESPN Sports because that video source will require the least amount of scaling and the TV will not require de-interlacing.</p>
