<p><a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20101121000281">The Korea Herald</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Samsung Electronics Co. said Sunday it has sold more than 600,000 units of its tablet PC globally just a month after its launch.</p>
<p>The 7-inch Galaxy Tab was first released in Italy in mid-October, challenging the global dominance of Apple Inc.&acirc;&euro;&trade;s 9.7-inch iPad.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Tab is now available in more than 30 countries in North America, Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>In Korea, about 30,000 units have been sold since its Nov. 14 launch through SK Telecom.</blockquote></p>
<p>That's a lot of Samsung Galaxy Tabs. The iPad sold one million in the same time frame. Still, Samsung was smart to blitz all the carriers at once. On the other hand, Apple's iPad is just getting around to South Korea with sales starting November 30th. KT the exclusive carrier to offer the iPad has taken 40,000 pre-orders in less than a week. That's an interesting figure since the Samsung Galaxy Tab only sold 30,000 in about a week in the Tab's home country.</p>
