<p>In a MobileMagazine article, they say that LG Electronics manufactured an ultra-thin TFT LCD display. Well, let me tell you that LG Electronics does not manufacture TFT LCD displays. There are only two LG-affiliated companies that can do something like this: LG.Philips LCD or LG Innotek. One of these guys, probably Innotek, made a 1.48mm thick 2.0"/2.2" TFT LCD with a 320 x 240 pixel format. Most likely, this will go into ultra-thin mobile phones and I would bet that LG Electronics who makes mobile phones and other consumer electronics goods and IT products will be making something way thinner than the SLVR and will not be supplying this ultra-thin display to Moto. At least, not for a while.</p>
