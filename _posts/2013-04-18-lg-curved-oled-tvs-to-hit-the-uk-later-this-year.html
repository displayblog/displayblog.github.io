<p>Luke Johnson, <a href="http://www.trustedreviews.com/news/curved-oled-tvs-to-hit-the-uk-later-this-year">Trusted Reviews</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Having unveiled the first curved display OLED TV at CES 2013 earlier this year, LG has suggested that the first curved screen TVs will launch in the UK later this year.</blockquote></p>
<p>Curved OLED TVs? If I'm back far enough the curvature will end up being a distraction. If LG wants to curve something curve a LCD monitor, like the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2012/08/28/lg-ea93/">EA93</a>.</p>
<p><em>Update 2013.04.28:</em> According to <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/04/28/lg-curved-oled-hdtv/">Engadget</a>, pre-orders for the LG 55EA9800 55-inch curved OLED TV starts April 29 at &#8361;15 million (~US$13,500) with shipments planned for June.</p>
