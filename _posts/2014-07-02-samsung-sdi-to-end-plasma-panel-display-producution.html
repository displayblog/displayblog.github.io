<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/01/us-samsung-sdi-plasma-idUSKBN0F62W620140701">Reuters</a>: Samsung SDI announced on Tuesday that the company will shut down its plasma panel production business by November 30, due to declining demand. I think the only company still manufacturing plasma display panels is LG.</p>
