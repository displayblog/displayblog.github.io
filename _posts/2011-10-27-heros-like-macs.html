<p><a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/10/27/hell-freezes-over-forrester-urges-it-to-support-the-mac/">Philip Elmer-DeWitt, Fortune</a>, quoting a Forrester report by David Johnson:</p>
<blockquote><p>Time is the only thing that these fierce competitors can't make more of. Many of today's corporate PCs are saddled with management, backup, and security agents that can bog down a PC. Employees want their PCs to boot in 10 seconds, not 10 minutes, and they don't want to have to get a cup of coffee while opening a 20 MB spreadsheet in Excel. They're drawn to uncluttered Macs &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; especially those with solid-state drives, which are more responsive and boot in seconds.</blockquote></p>
<p>Forrester has a term for "these fierce competitors": Highly Empowered and Resourceful Operatives or HERO.</p>
