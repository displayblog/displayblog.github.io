  iMac</a>. I won't go through everything here; just a few tidbits regarding the
  display. First, the glass panel that covers the LCD is not glued on. Nor is it screwed
  on. Magneto will be proud: fourteen magnets hold the glass panel within the metal
  bezel. And that's why iFixit used two Ferrari-red 3M 'bondo' suction cups (suction
  cup dent puller) imported from Maranello, Italy, to remove the glass panel. The
  rear of the glass panel has a metallic bezel with seven alignment posts. The actual
  magnets are located in the iMac's aluminum front bezel. So that's one interesting
  tidbit. Two more after the jump. "

<p style="text-align: left; ">The second one is the LCD itself. It is an <a href="http://www.google.com/custom?hl=en&amp;safe=active&amp;client=pub-1028052232505250&amp;channel=0117441043&amp;cof=FORID:1;AH:left;S:http://www.displayblog.com;CX:DisplayBlog%2520Search%2520Engine;L:http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/themes/ProSense-Grey/images/displayblog_logo_03_thin.jpg;LH:50;LC:%230000ff;VLC:%23663399;GFNT:%230000ff;GIMP:%230000ff;DIV:%23336699;&amp;adkw=AELymgVGLldoh8t2ouOlVhAPgpdsHXyigQMRNYlgIuG5F1PWZak_ToZvQIBVzoWZ74UrkDz2Fe21Q2oA2QMtyiP_SWMgGN1SQRW7T69HpuUdnR-exNFa1YAjDntKbEIU4nhLKBSz-vfhTQkWv0pPlqdLAhaQ62OotQcByiCy5sFVbct7ohT48Mag4wuPgx_Ux6KFi-KY6AhASyCE-cOLXF0V8QreP-VIKA&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;oe=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=au+optronics&amp;btnG=Search&amp;cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250:utpr0mvi0e9">AU Optronics</a> (AUO) part M302EW02 that was manufactured on '09/04'. iFixit is guessing that it means that the LCD was manufactured in the 4th week of 2009. Unfortunately, the AUO part is a TN (Twisted Nematic) LCD with a viewing angle of just 170/160. Not so good in my book. But since the iMac is targeted toward consumers and not design professionals, maybe this cost-cutting decision can be somewhat understood. The 24" iMac sports a CCFL backlight... which gets us to #3.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-4353 aligncenter" title="apple_2009_24_imac_ifixit_teardown_inverter" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/apple_2009_24_imac_ifixit_teardown_inverter.jpg" alt="apple_2009_24_imac_ifixit_teardown_inverter" width="500" height="325" /></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">The third interesting tidbit is about what iFixit said about this CCFL backlight: "This particular display features four backlights, each of which require their own high-voltage AC power. All four are powered by a single large inverter." I think what they meant to say was there are four CCFL tubes within the single CCFL backlight. Each of the CCFL tubes are then powered by a high-voltage AC connection via a single large inverter.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">What a teardown by iFixit! I wonder if they'll ever do cars...</p></p>
