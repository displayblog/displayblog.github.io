<p><a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2011/03/02/hands-on-with-the-ipad-2/">Greg Kumparak</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&acirc;&euro;&trade;s something about holding a new Apple device that feels unreal &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; and that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not whatever Fanboy-side I have rearing its head. Apple devices are ubiquitous; their silhouette and feel and weight tends to become engrained in the brain. When Apple goes and shaves a few millimeters off, holding the new device is just a bit of a system shock. That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s certainly the case here. Apple shaved 33% off of the thickness, and it really, <em>really</em> shows.</blockquote></p>
<p>It seems Kumparak had a similar experience to <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/03/02/ipad-2-skinny-light/">Brian Chen</a>. Didn't think it was going to be a really big deal, but I think I'm going to be surprised when I get my hands on the iPad 2.</p>
