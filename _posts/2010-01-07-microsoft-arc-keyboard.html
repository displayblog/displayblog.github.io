<p>Though Microsoft's Arc Keyboard isn't display-related, I had to mention that it is quite beautiful, sexy even. I'm really surprised that this is from Microsoft! The Arc Keyboard is wireless and uses the crowded 2.4GHz band and will be available on February 21 for US$59.95. (After looking at the picture on Microsoft's site, it doesn't look as sexy any more.)
