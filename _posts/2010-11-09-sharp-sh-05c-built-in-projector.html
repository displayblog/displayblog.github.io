<p><a href="http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2010/11/09/sharp-shows-cell-phone-with-built-in-projector/">MobileCrunch</a>: The Sharp SH-05C sports a 3.7-inch touch-enabled LCD with a 16:9 854x480 pixel format and a 5.3 megapixel CMOS camera with auto-focus is onboard. Unlike most other mere phones the SH-05C has a built-in projector. The DLP-based pico projector features 9 lumens of brightness and can pump out 640x360 pixels, an interesting choice, for two hours on a full charge. The Sharp SH-05C will be available on NTT DoCoMo in February 2011.</p>
