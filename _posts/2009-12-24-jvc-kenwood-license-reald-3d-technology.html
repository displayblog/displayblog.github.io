<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/12/21/sony-license-reald-3d-tech/">Sony did it</a>; now it's JVC-Kenwood's turn. RealD's 3D technology took part of the awesome 3D effects in Avatar: audiences the world over seems to think it is one solid 3D experience and I agree. 3D is here to stay even with the funky glasses.
