<p>Toshiba's Qosmio X500 is a massive 18.4-inch gaming notebook PC. NVIDIA's GTX 460M is the GPU of choice. The US$1200 box can be equipped with either an Intel Core i5 or i7 CPU. Other specs include: dual SSD (option), up to 6GB DDR3 RAM, a backlit keyboard. You can also equip the X500 with Blu-ray, which makes a nice coupling with the 1920x1080 pixel format. But even with a regular DVD the company's Resolution+ technology should make SD/ED look better by up-converting to HD. The Qosmio X500 is available on September 26th. The keyboard is more towards the middle on the X500, but not quite, which is unfortunate.
