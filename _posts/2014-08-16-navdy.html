<p><a href="https://www.navdy.com/">Navdy</a>: San Francisco based Navdy is working on a projector called Navdy. The US$299 (pre-order price) dashboard mounted projector projects a heads-up display on the car's windshield with information such as caller ID and navigation. You use voice and hand gestures to control it. Nifty.</p>
