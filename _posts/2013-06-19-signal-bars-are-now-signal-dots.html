<p>I've been digesting the changes in iOS 7 Apple presented during WWDC 2013. One of those changes is signal bars. As you might have guessed, I like dots. On DisplayBlog I use three dots (red, green, and blue) as a logo and an end-of-article indicator. It seems Ive and his team like dots too: Signal bars are now signal dots. Unfortunately these dots take much more space than signal bars, but they don't have to. Apple showed five dots, but I think that's two too many. Make it three dots: Low, Average, High. Three dots take about as much space as the signal bars in previous iOS versions and are simpler to understand.</p>
