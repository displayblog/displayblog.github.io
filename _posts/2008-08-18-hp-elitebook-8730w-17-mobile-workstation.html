<p><a href="http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF06a/321957-321957-64295-3740645-3329741-3784202.html">HP</a>: The HP EliteBook 8730w certainly deserves the 'elite' prefix as it is one of the most powerful mobile workstations around. With the option of a 3.06GHz Intel Core 2 Extreme CPU (X9100) and up to 8GB (EIGHT!) of 800MHz DDR2 SDRAM you won't have to worry about computing power. HP could have squeezed out a bit more system power by going with DDR3, but with 8GB on tap, few will feel the need for more. Graphically, the 8730w is just as powerful with the option of an 1GB NVIDIA Quadro FX 3700M. Wow. Couple that with the 17.0" 1920x1200 DreamColor WVA (Wide Viewing Angle) LCD, and you've got one of the most serious graphics combination on a notebook PC platform.</p>
<p>Storage? Not a problem. The option of replacing the optical drive with an optional hard disk gives you a total storage potential of 640GB (320GB x 2) in RAID 0 or up the reliability quotient by going with RAID 1 and still have 320GB of storage spinning at a quick 7200RPM.</p>
<p>Lugging a 17" notebook PC is not fun. I have a Dell Inspiron 9300 and it is far from light. But if you do have a need to take the 8730w, you'll be happy to know that it has an option for WWAN, either AT&amp;T or Verizon Wireless, for a 3G connection on-the-go. Back home, you can connect the 8730w to a LCD TV or a LCD monitor via its HDMI connection. Unfortunately for many, a DVI connection is absent. You will need a male-DVI to male-HDMI cable to connect an older high-end LCD monitor with just DVI connections.</p>
<p>If there ever was a true desktop replacement notebook PC, the 8730w would be one of the most powerful notebook PC to do so. I would guess that the 8730w with the top-of-the-line options would be more powerful than 80% of the desktop PCs out there. Just a guess.</p>
