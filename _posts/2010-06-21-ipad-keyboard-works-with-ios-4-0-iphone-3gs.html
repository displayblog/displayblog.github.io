<p>Andy Ihnatko has mated the iPad keyboard and an iOS 4.0-upgraded iPhone 3GS... and it works! Function keys work too, like the home and multimedia buttons. The connection is tight so Ihnatko suspects the dock connector could get cracked and recommends using the Bluetooth Apple keyboard instead.&Acirc;&nbsp;USB keyboards connected via the iPad Camera Connection Kit on the iOS 4.0 iPhone 3GS does <em>not</em> work unfortunately. There's a <a href="http://ihnatko.com/2010/06/21/the-ipad-keyboard-dock-works-with-the-iphone-3gs/">video</a> for you to enjoy.</p>
