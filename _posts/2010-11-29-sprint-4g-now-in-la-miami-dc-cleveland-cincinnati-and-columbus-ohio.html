<p><a href="http://newsroom.sprint.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=1725">Sprint</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sprint today officially unleashed the power of 4G &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; enabling fast mobile downloads, wireless video chat and turbo-charged mobile Web browsing up to 10 times faster than 3G service1 &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; in Los Angeles, Miami, Washington D.C., Cleveland, Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio.</blockquote></p>
<p>There are 68 4G markets in the US including New York City. The San Francisco area will be doused with 4G signals starting on December 28th. Sprint 4G downloads are rated at 6Mbps. Quite fast. So far only the HTC EVO 4G and the Samsung Epic 4G smartphones can take advantage of Sprint's 4G.</p>
