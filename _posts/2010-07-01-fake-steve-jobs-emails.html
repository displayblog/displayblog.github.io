<p><a href="http://www.boygeniusreport.com/2010/07/01/exclusive-conversation-with-steve-jobs-on-the-iphone-4-antenna-problems/">Boy Genius Report</a> (BGR) reported earlier today of an email exchange between Tom (ficticious name) and Steve Jobs. BGR looked through the email headers and believed it to be 100% legitimate. Not 95%, 100%.</p>
<p>Here's some of the things Jobs reportedly said in response to Tom, a professed Mac fan, who was more than upset about iPhone 4's antenna issue and sent an email to an Apple engineer:</p>
<blockquote><p>No, you are getting all worked up over a few days of rumors. Calm down.</blockquote></p>
<blockquote><p>You are most likely in an area with very low signal strength.</blockquote></p>
<blockquote><p>You may be working from bad data. Not your fault. Stay tuned. We are working on it.</blockquote><br />
So what's the big fuss about? The email exchange is fake according to Apple PR and as reported by Fortune's <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/07/01/apple-pr-steve-jobs-iphone-4-conversation-is-a-fake/?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Apple 2.0</a> blog. <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/07/01/exclusive_conversations_with_steve_jobs_up_for_sale.html">AppleInsider</a> reports the email exchange was shopped around by a Virginia man two days before appearing on BGR. Wild.</p>
