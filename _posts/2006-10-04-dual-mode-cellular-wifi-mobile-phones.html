<p>I think cellular network company CEOs should have a lot to worry about, especially in the US. Thanks to their sluggish rollout of fast cellular networks, the US is probably <em>the</em> only 1st world country in the entire world that does not have true 3G cellular networks. I think we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve waited long enough and maybe we shouldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t even wait. According to ABI Research, shipments of dual-mode cellular and WiFi mobile phones will hit 300 million units in 2011. I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t like forecasts that go out that many years (I mean who really knows what will happen?), but 300 million is a lot. With WiFi being the faster network in the US, I would certainly expect major consumption of bandwidth for multimedia content to become a reality. Take for instance Sony&acirc;&euro;&trade;s mylo and expand the screen size a bit, increase the resolution and keep the price down to below $300 and you have a multimedia-consuming eco-system that should be pretty interesting to be a part of. As we consume more multimedia content, the display becomes more of a critical piece. I hope we can see VGA (640 x 480) resolutions in devices like the mylo or even on the iPod. ABI Research says that the majority of the dual-mode mobile phones will be based on the 802.11n WiFi technology.</p>
