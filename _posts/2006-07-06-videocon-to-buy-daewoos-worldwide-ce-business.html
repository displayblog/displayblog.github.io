<p>For $500-$600 million according to some sources, says <a href="http://www.agencyfaqs.com/news/stories/2006/07/06/15457.html">agencyfaqs!</a>. Videocon's chairman VN Dhoot believes there's a strong synergy between the two electronic businesses. Haier, LG and a couple of investment funds were also bidders. Daewoo, I believe, has absolutely no presence in the Korean CE market and I have yet seen a decent Daewoo-branded TV in the US. I don't know, but $500-$600 million sounds like a lot for nothing.</p>
