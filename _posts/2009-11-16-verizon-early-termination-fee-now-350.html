<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=verizon&amp;sa=Search#1348">Verizon</a> just increased its early termination fee from $175 to $350 for an "advanced device". An advanced device? Pretty vague. Thankfully <a href="http://support.vzw.com/information/advanced_devices.html">Verizon has a list</a>. Of course, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=motorola+droid&amp;sa=Search#1333">Motorola's DROID</a> is on the list. Verizon's "<a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/globalText?textName=CUSTOMER_AGREEMENT&amp;jspName=footer/customerAgreement.jsp">Customer Agreement</a>" is on the Internet for all to see.</p>
<p><strong>Weird</strong> For every full month $10 is deducted from the $350 fee. Even after you fulfill your two-year (24 months) commitment there is a $110 termination fee left. If you are serious about becoming a Verizon customer because you want that advanced device I would be very thorough in my research and ask whether I will be charged if I decide to leave Verizon at the end of my 2-year contract.</p>
<p><strong>Advice</strong> Sounds like a terribly complicated move on the part of Verizon. Here's some advice Verizon: set a termination fee, divide that by 24, and deduct <em>that</em> amount from the total termination fee on a monthly basis.</p>
