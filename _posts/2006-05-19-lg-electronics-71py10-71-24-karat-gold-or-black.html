<p>LGE's 71PY10 is the world's first commercially available 71" plasma TV, also making it the largest available. You have two color choices: black or 24-karat gold, 4 pounds worth! According to some reviews, the screen performs as good as it looks. With a full HD pixel format (1920*1080), HDMI and SCART connections, XD Engine that improves color, contrast and scaling, the 71" monster delivers. The price? Well if you must ask... US$170,000. The all black version is a cool US$119,000.
