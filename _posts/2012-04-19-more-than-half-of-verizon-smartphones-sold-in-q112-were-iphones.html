<p><a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120419/verizon-half-of-our-first-quarter-smartphone-sales-were-iphones/">John Paczkowski, AllThingsD</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s iPhone continues to sell well at Verizon, though not quite as well as last quarter. Reporting <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120419/verizon-sees-sales-profits-climb-from-year-ago-levels-on-wireless-growth/">first-quarter earnings largely in line with expectations this morning</a>, Verizon said it sold 6.3 million smartphones. Of those, 3.2 million were iPhones.</blockquote></p>
<p>Now I understand why, if true, <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2012/verizon-vows-support-windows-phone-third-ecosystem/">Verizon wants to support building a strong third platform</a>.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.06.04:</em> Horace Dediu:</p>
<blockquote><p>The concern has to be that rather than seeing the net adds growing&acirc;&euro;&ldquo;as they have for two years with only two contiguous months of decline&acirc;&euro;&ldquo;Android net adds have been falling for four months.</blockquote></p>
<p>Eyeballing the last chart in <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2012/06/04/trouble-with-the-robot/">Dediu's article</a> it looks like Windows Phone experienced the most net user gains since, well, quite a while. I wonder if carriers like Verizon is focused on pushing more Windows Phone.</p>
