<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/15/galaxy-tab-coming-to-atandt-november-21st-for-650/">Engadget</a>: AT&T will be charing $650 for the Samsung Galaxy Tab off-contract starting November 21st. The data plan options are $15 for 250MB and $25 for 2GB.</p>
<p>I'm not having a dandy-ol-time with my iPhone 4's data connection, so if I were in the market for a Samsung Galaxy Tab the only stores I would be heading towards would be marked Verizon. Which by the way sells it for $50 less and for just $5 more you get 1GB. The only big difference is that you're tied to a two-year contract.</p>
