<p>Three Czech individuals supposedly acquired Apple's next-generation iPhone, which I will refer to as simply iPhone HD, and took pictures with a microscope showing what the RGB sub-pixel structure looks like: quite a bit like any other RGB TFT LCD. I don't know at which magnification the picture was taken so it is anyone's guess whether or not this is a picture of the real LCD in the iPhone HD. I don't think there is evidence to suggest that the iPhone HD will not have a pixel format of 960x640 so for now I can freely dream of how wonderful content would look on such a high-density 3.5-inch LCD...
