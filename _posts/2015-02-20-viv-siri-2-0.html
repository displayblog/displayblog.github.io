<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/08/viv/">Steven Levy, Wired</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But Kittlaus points out that all of these services are strictly limited. Cheyer elaborates: &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Google Now has a huge knowledge graph&mdash;you can ask questions like &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Where was Abraham Lincoln born?&acirc;&euro;&trade; And it can name the city. You can also say, &acirc;&euro;&tilde;What is the population?&acirc;&euro;&trade; of a city and it&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll bring up a chart and answer. But you cannot say, &acirc;&euro;&tilde;What is the population of the city where Abraham Lincoln was born?&acirc;&euro;&trade;&acirc;&euro; The system may have the data for both these components, but it has no ability to put them together, either to answer a query or to make a smart suggestion. Like Siri, it can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t do anything that coders haven&acirc;&euro;&trade;t explicitly programmed it to do.</p>
<p>Viv breaks through those constraints by generating its own code on the fly, no programmers required. Take a complicated command like <i>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Give me a flight to Dallas with a seat that Shaq could fit in.&acirc;&euro;</i> Viv will parse the sentence and then it will perform its best trick: automatically generating a quick, efficient program to link third-party sources of information together&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;say, Kayak, SeatGuru, and the NBA media guide&mdash;so it can identify available flights with lots of legroom. And it can do all of this in a fraction of a second.</blockquote></p>
<p>This article, <i>Siri&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Inventors Are Building a Radical New AI That Does Anything You Ask</i> was published several months ago in August of 2014, but I just got to it because of the news that the company closed US$12.5 million in Series B funding.</p>
<p>Self-learning makes artificial intelligence less artificial. If VIV can become a personal AI that is always with me, and helps me get through the day... well, that might be like having Samantha from the movie <i>Her</i>. Crazy.</p>
