Dell's 3008WFP 30" LCD monitor sports a LG Display supplied S-IPS panel. The S-IPS panel that is inside Apple's 30" was specially developed by using a unique copper-bus design that took a lot of engineering work. The copper-bus enables Apple's 30" to run flicker-free at 2560 x 1600 at 60Hz on a huge 30" screen. I am not sure if Dell uses the same LCD panel on its 3008WFP, which has a wider color gamut and a better contrast ratio.<br />
</p>
<p>
The improved color gamut is based on a Wide Color Gamut CCFL (WCG-CCFL) backlight unit (BLU). The phosphor coatings on the CCFL is improved to offer a wider color gamut. I am not sure how the contrast ratio is being improved, but my guess is that the CCFLs are being throttled: dimmer when the content is dark and brighter when content is brighter resulting in a dynamic contrast ratio that is much more improved than static CR.<br />
</p>
<p>
The design is standard Dell but with a dash of piano black, adding a bit more flare for those consumers looking for it in their tech wares. The numerous inputs (as well as many other features) will prevent this monitor from becoming obsolete in the near future.<br />

Engadget is reporting that Dell has pulled the 3008WFP from its website and responded with the following answer when asked about it:<br />
</p>
<p>
"The Dell 3008 monitor has been well received since launch and has been very popular with customers. In February we experienced a small technical issue with the product that has been long resolved. Currently the monitors are on extended lead times and in order to manage demand, the 3008 is not available on dell.com. We are managing orders on a prioritized basis and hope to have the product available to all customers in the near future."<br />

Good news for everyone who has been waiting to purchase <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=dell">Dell</a>'s 30" monster <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-monitor">LCD monitor</a> the 3008WFP! According to <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/05/13/dells-3008wfp-is-available-again-technical-issues-resolved/">Engadget</a>, technical issues have been resolved and the 3008WFP is again available for purchase online at <a href="http://accessories.dell.com/sna/category.aspx?c=ca&category_id=6761&cs=cadhs1&l=en&s=dhs&~ck=anav&nf=~3~694&navla=~3~694">dell.com</a>. </p>
<p>Just bear in mind that you'll need for fork over $2049 for 30" of LCD real estate. To me that's simply too expensive. You get <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=2560-x-1600">2560 x 1600</a> for $2049!!! Want to maximize LCD real estate purchases? Then get 3840 x 1200 for just $1398 with two 2408WFPs! Or if you really must get a 30" for some reason (you don't like bezels for instance) then get the 3007WFP-HC for a mere $1299.</p>
