<p><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/ifa-2014-huawei-announces-ascend-mate-7-huge-display-minimal-bezel-eight-cores-7000033312/">ZDNet</a>: The Huawei Ascend Mate 7 is a 6-inch smartphone with an 83 percent screen-to-body ratio, which means most of the front is the display. To compare, the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/06/10/lg-g3-space-efficient/">LG G3 is 76.4 percent</a>. The physical size of the Ascend Mate 7 is just a little bigger than the 5.7-inch <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/09/03/samsung-galaxy-note-4/">Galaxy Note 4</a>, but thinner at 7.9mm.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the pixel format is disappointing: 1920x1080. (The sourced ZDNet article inaccurately states the pixel format as 2560x1600, which would make the aspect ratio of the display an unusual 16:10.) By looking at the size of the display and the pixel format I would categorize the Ascend Mate 7 as <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/09/04/5-inch-and-larger-displays-with-1280x720-at-ifa-20145-inch-and-larger-displays-with-1280x720/">mid-range</a>.</p>
