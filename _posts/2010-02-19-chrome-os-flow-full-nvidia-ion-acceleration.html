<p><a href="http://chromeos.hexxeh.net/">Hexxeh</a>: If you have an ION GPU doing the graphics work and running Chrome OS (ChromiumOS), make sure to download and install the latest Hexxeh build called Flow: it takes full advantage of NVIDIA's ION GPU. The already featherweight OS should start flying now.</p>
