<blockquote><p>Peter Jackson, who's made a few movies, is preparing to shoot another one called <em>The Hobbit</em>. That's interesting news! What's also interesting is how he will film it: Thirty uber-expensive RED EPIC cameras. It's good to be the king.</blockquote></p>
<p>Each RED EPIC costs $US58,000.</p>
