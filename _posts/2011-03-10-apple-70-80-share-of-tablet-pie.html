<p><a href="http://www.idc.com/about/viewpressrelease.jsp?containerId=prUS22737611">IDC</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple is building on its strong 2010 first-generation iPad launch with the iPad 2, which will ship this month, before most competitors come to market with first generation media tablets. Although more competing devices will be launched this year, IDC expects Apple to maintain a 70-80% share of the market.</blockquote></p>
<p>Motorola, HP, HTC, Samsung, LG, RIM, and even Lenovo would probably disagree with IDC. I don't: as these brands flood the market with more and more tablets, consumers will forgo the complicated decision making process and simply decide to get the iPad.</p>
<p>Choosing whether to get the black or white version could get tricky though.</p>
