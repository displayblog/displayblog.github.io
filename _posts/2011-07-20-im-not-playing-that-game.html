<blockquote><p>Every time Apple comes out with a new product (the new Air! OSX Lion! the new iPad or iPhone!), we eagerly snatch it up, willingly waiting in line for the chance to pay a chunk of our lives &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; the time spent earning the money it costs to buy the product.</p>
<p>I could go on all day, and in fact, we all go on all day with this game.</p>
<p>Or instead, we could simply say, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m not playing that game.&acirc;&euro;¬ù Because honestly, there&acirc;&euro;&trade;s no way we can win.</blockquote></p>
<p>Today, Apple put up its latest operating system, OS X Lion, on the Mac App Store for you to purchase for US$29.99. The who's who of writers have put up their reviews of Lion and it has been impossible to hide from all the hoopla. At one point, just minutes ago in fact, I almost caved and started the 3.76GB download. But then, I thought:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don't <em>need</em> it.</blockquote></p>
<p>I'm perfectly content with OS X Snow Leopard. The way the desktop looks, the tools that I use, and all the little tweaks over many months are all in harmony. When it comes to technology, I can change, rapidly in fact, but only when I see real value in the change. The biggest feature OS X Lion brings to the table is full screen modes for apps like Safari. Full screen allows me to focus on one thing at a time. But I already do that by limiting the number of windows, to one at times.</p>
<p>Mission Control integrates Spaces, Expose, etc. but doesn't help me. My late brother, Don, was always wary of having more than one browser window open. I know why: he wanted to focus. One app. One window. Full Screen mode can help, but you can do that with a bit of self discipline right now without spending a penny.</p>

<p>Launch Pad lays out a grid of apps on the desktop. Well, that doesn't help either. I like my desktop completely blank. And because I use only a handful of apps (Safari, Chrome for when Flash is needed, Seashore, iTunes, Spotify, and iMovie from time to time) the grid would be less efficient. The Dock, auto-hidden, can be directly accessed at any time from anywhere. With apps on the desktop, you have to dig down to get to it. Seems more work to me.</p>
<p>Resume, Autosave, Versions: When I'm done for the day, I like cleaning up. All apps are closed and I put my MacBook Pro to sleep. Pressing Command-S hasn't been an issue for me. Versions store tens if not hundreds of different versions of my documents somewhere on my SSD? That doesn't sound tidy to me. I'd rather have just one version, the version I'm working on.</p>
<p>Mail: I use webmail versions of Gmail and my work mail. I don't see a need to setup an email client that requires setting up, additional resources, etc.</p>
<p>I try my best to be a minimalist when it comes to computer resources. I dislike apps that are unnecessarily large, apps that spew files all over the drive, apps that try to do too many things but can't do anything really well, etc. From where I sit, OS X Lion is nice to have, but with Snow Leopard I already have everything I need to get work done, or relax.</p>
