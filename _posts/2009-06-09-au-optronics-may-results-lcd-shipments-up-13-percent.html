<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=au+optronics&amp;sa=Search">AU Optronics</a> (AUO) announced its May 2009 results on June 8, 2009. Preliminary consolidated revenues increased 13.8 percent month-over-month but decreased 37.5 percent year-over-year to NT$27,728 million. Large-sized LCD panel shipments increased 13.3 percent month-over-month to over 7.77 million units. On the other hand, small/medium-sized LCD panels decreased 13.9 percent month-over-month to 19.29 million units.</p>
<p><strong>Inventory</strong> Results look good with both revenues and large-sized LCD panel shipments increasing in double-digits. But what worries me is the lack of positive results coming from retailers claiming double-digit month-over-month growth in sales of LCD TVs, notebook PCs and LCD monitors. Are brands stuffing the channel? Or is inventory building in Asia?</p>
