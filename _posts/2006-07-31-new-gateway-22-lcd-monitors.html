<p>Gateway currently has 19" and 21" wide LCD monitors. The 19" wide (FPD1975W) has a 1440 x 900 resolution and is priced at $229.99 on <a href="http://accessories.gateway.com/AccessoryStore/PC+Accessories_316441/Monitors_316684/LCD+_Q1_Flat+Panel_Q1_+Monitors_316694/18_D1_19+inch+LCD_381954/1535878R_proddetail.htm?ref=merch">Gateway's website</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://accessories.gateway.com/AccessoryStore/PC+Accessories_316441/Monitors_316684/LCD+_Q1_Flat+Panel_Q1_+Monitors_316694/20_D1_21+inch+LCD_381955/1535870_proddetail.htm?ref=merch">FPD2185W</a>, is Gateway's 21" wide LCD monitor with 1680 x 1050 resolution and a $499.99 price. That seems to be a pretty wide gap between the two prices. The potential to fill in the gap is very high. But the interesting part is that most likely the gap filler will be a 22" wide LCD monitor. Why?</p>
<p>Hanns.G, who is an integrator based in Taiwan started shipping samples of 22" LCD monitor sets to Gateway and Viewsonic in addition to Taiwanese local brands. Hanns.G has stated that new 22" LCD monitors should hit stores by around August. CMO is also making 22" wide TFT LCD panels and prices should be cheaper than 20" or 21" wide panels because it will be using TN technology, which is cheaper than VA or IPS.</p>
