<p>What is the worst case scenario for torturing an iPhone 6 Plus? Josh Lowensohn, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/25/6845611/inside-apples-iphone-6-torture-building">The Verge</a>:</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a test for when people sit on a soft surface, when the iPhone is sat on, as well as what Apple considers the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;worst-case scenario,&acirc;&euro;¬ù which is when it goes into the rear pocket of skinny jeans and sits on a hard surface &ndash; at an angle.</p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>And that is what some of us do. Accidents happen, and it is a normal part of life. If you have bent your iPhone 6 Plus Phil Schiller recommends you go to the Genius Bar.</p></p>
