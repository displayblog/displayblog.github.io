<blockquote><p>Now you have an idea of the core parts of the OS, but Microsoft&acirc;&euro;&trade;s also done some unique things in terms of touch gestures and applications. The entire UI interaction is centered around gestures from all four sides of the screen. The left side lets you navigate through apps &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll see in the video that you can bring in open apps from the left and have them fill the entire screen or you can snap another one next to it and have two apps live side by side. (Note: only tablets with a 1366 x 768 resolution or higher will support the multiple app feature.)</blockquote></p>
<p>Are there any currently available tablets that can make use of this multiple app feature on Windows 8?</p>
