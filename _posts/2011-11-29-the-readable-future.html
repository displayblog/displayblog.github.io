<p><a href="http://inessential.com/2011/11/25/the_readable_future">Brent Simmons</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Readers are smart, and they love to read, and they&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll go where they can read, and they have more and more options.</blockquote></p>
<p>Some of those options where they can read: Flipboard, Instapaper, Readability, the Reader button in Safari, RSS readers, etc. These tools and services do one main thing: They strip distractions out so you can focus on reading. The following example of obese pages on TheNextWeb is but one example why readers have been seeking the options aforementioned.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jpcody/status/141632439654166528">Joshua Cody's tweet</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Need a warning when @gruber links to @thenextweb - 452 HTTP requests, 3.12MB, 1 minute to load, repeated Badgeville (what?!) errors.</blockquote></p>
<p>John Gruber responds to Cody's tweet in the excellently titled "<a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/11/29/thenextweb-shit-ass-website">Regarding TheNextWeb's Shit-Ass Website</a>":</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2011/11/30/googles-newly-designed-bar-is-now-going-live/">One article</a> at TheNextWeb weighed in at over 6 MB and required 342 HTTP requests. 73 different JavaScript scripts alone. Absurd.</blockquote></p>
<p>The folks at TNW must have tweaked something because I loaded that "one article" and got 51 requests and 234KB transferred. But it still took 1.7 minutes for that one page to completely load. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/11/28/sharp">A random post on Daring Fireball</a> required 14 requests, 12.36KB, and 785ms. That's more like it. I was of course curious as to how my site performs. <a href="/2011/11/28/dont-buy-this-jacket/">Random post</a>: 2 requests, 3.58KB, and 285ms. Not too shabby, but not too surprising since DisplayBlog is the result of a singular focus on eliminating everything unnecessary so readers experience distraction-free reading.</p>
<p>Gruber:</p>
<blockquote><p>How long it takes to load the page is part of the reading experience. Bandwidth is not free, and not universally fast.</blockquote></p>
<p>Strip down unnecessary crap and let readers read without distraction. Save readers time by reducing the time to load pages. And save readers money by reducing bandwidth.</p>
