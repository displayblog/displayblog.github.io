  about the 3\" VGA display on the 50D. There are at least three anti-reflection coats

  that images can be easily seen in bright ambient environments. There is also a dirt-resistant
  fluorine coat as well as a scratch-resistant hard coat. These coatings will help
  keep the LCD clean and ultimately allow for optimum viewing of images. Source: <a

  The 40D had 10.1 million effective pixels and the 50D increases that to 15.1 million
  effective pixels. Pixel count will continue to increase but some time in the future
  the point will be reached where picture quality starts to decrease given a APS-C
  sized CMOS sensor. Of course, at that time we might see affordable full-sized CMOS
  sensors. I'm hoping there will be a 5D successor announced soon. I digress, unto
  the 3\" VGA LCD monitor. "

<p>The 40D is no slouch and neither was the 30D that it replaced. The 40D incorporated a 3.0" TFT LCD with a 230,000 pixels. The previous 30D had a smaller 2.5" TFT LCD but with the same pixel count of 230,000. So the LCD got bigger but didn't allow for more pixels. The 50D changes that with a 3.0" TFT LCD with a pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=640-x-480">640 x 480</a> for a total pixel count of 307,200. That's a 34% increase in the number of pixels from the 40D. Will this help in taking pictures? Absolutely. With Live View capabilities in the 50D (the 40D has it too), you can frame the image on the LCD. With a LCD that is more capable, you are able to see the image with more precision. With more precision you are more likely to take better pictures. I like to look through my 20D's viewfinder, but I am certain I will enjoy a live view LCD on a DSLR since I use live view on my compact (SD1000) close to 100% of the time.</p>
