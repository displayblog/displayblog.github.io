<p>Last week, Samsung started construction of a EUR 72 million plasma TV factory in God, near Budapest. The plant will occupy 22,000 m2 and create about 550 jobs. The factory will take about 1/2 year to complete with a target date of April 2007. One-third of the factory&acirc;&euro;&trade;s capacity will be used for Samsung only and the rest of its capacity will be sold to other TV manufacturers.</p>
<p>As Western Europe&acirc;&euro;&trade;s HD adoption increases the tax hit will become increasingly more painful for TV brands that manufacture outside of that region. Samsung, LG.Philips LCD, Toshiba, Sharp, IPS Alpha, etc. have all either announced, is constructing, or started operations in Europe.</p>
