<p>IDC <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110505007011/en/Smartphone-Market-Grows-79.7-Year-Year-Quarter">BusinessWire</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple reached a new record shipment volume in a single quarter, and inched closer to market leader Nokia with fewer than six million units separating the two companies. The company posted market-beating year-over-year growth and recorded triple-digit growth in two key markets: the United States, with the release of its CDMA-enabled iPhone, and Greater China. Additionally, the company enlisted South Korean Telecom and Saudi Telecom as carrier providers of the iPhone.</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple at #2 captured 18.7% market share in smartphone unit shipments for the first quarter 2011. iPhone shipments grew 114% Y/Y.</p>
<blockquote><p>Samsung posted the largest year-over-year gain of any other vendor on the list. With a multiple operating system strategy in place, Samsung has been able to grow its smartphone portfolio to meet the needs of a diverse market. Accounting for the majority of its smartphones and driving shipment volumes higher was the continued success of its Android-based smartphones, including the high-end Galaxy S devices and mass-market Galaxy Ace and Galaxy mini devices.</blockquote></p>
<p>Samsung's market share was 10.8% at #4 behind RIM but the company's smartphone shipment growth was an impressive 350% Y/Y. If growth continues like this for Samsung by this time 2012 we'll be looking at Samsung leapfrogging everyone else and dethroning Nokia.</p>
<p>We all know that unit shipment market share isn't the most important figure, that goes to profits and Apple is way ahead of everyone else in that department according to Canaccord <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-smarphone-profits-2011-5">Business Insider</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to an analysis by Canaccord Genuity's T. Michael Walkley, Apple captured "a remarkable 50% value share of estimated Q1/11 handset industry operating profits among the top 8 OEMs with only 4.9% global handset unit market share."</blockquote></p>
