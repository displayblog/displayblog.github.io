<p><a href="https://lgepr.lge.com/upload/press/2013/(Global%20release)_LG%20Ultra%20HD%20TV%20Release%20FINAL_EDIT_HE%20Final_0711%5B20130712131815027%5D.pdf">LG</a>: <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2013/07/10/samsung-f9000/">Samsung announced its 4K TVs</a>, now it's LG's turn. The LA9700 4K LCD TV series come in two sizes at 55 and 65 inches, priced US$6999 and $7999 respectively. The LG 4K LCD TVs are more expensive than Samsung's equivalents, which doesn't seem like a smart move considering Samsung has the stronger brand in markets that would consider purchasing 4K TVs.</p>
