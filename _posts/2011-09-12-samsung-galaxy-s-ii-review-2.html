<p>Brian Klug and Anand Lai Shimpi, <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/4686/samsung-galaxy-s-2-international-review-the-best-redefined/6">AnandTech</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The only major issue outdoors is something else entirely. I noticed pretty quickly with the Infuse 4G and Droid Charge that outside in my climate&acirc;&euro;&trade;s environment (~100+F outdoor temps, lots of sunlight) that the phones would clamp brightness to about 75% to prevent overheating. This is in part a measure to protect the display panel and of course other internal components. I set out to find out whether SGS2 implements the same thermal restrictions, and it does.</blockquote></p>
<p>Exactly when you need the Samsung Galaxy S II to put out as much brightness as it can, it goes into self preservation mode and limits brightness to 75% of maximum, about 226 nits*. Who should this brilliance be attributed to?</p>
<blockquote><p>Another small thing about the SGS2&acirc;&euro;&trade;s SAMOLED+ is that I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve noticed that high contrast images can be persistent for a few seconds. It isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t burn-in, but a persistence that stays for a few seconds and can be very visible. For example, leaving the Android keyboard up (which is black, grey, and white) and dragging the shade down, a shadow of the keyboard remains visible until it fades after a few seconds. This persists even on other applications as well, and I can only hope doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t become something permanent if left up too long.</blockquote></p>
<p>The 4.3-inch Super AMOLED Plus always pumps out high contrast images, doesn't it? And that means you'll be treated to ghosting whatever you do for a few seconds at a time. That would drive me up the wall. I would categorize this type of behavior as defective.</p>
<blockquote><p>[...] Where WVGA starts to become a problem is at 4.5". Scaling up area and increasing the diagonal size by 0.2" doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t sound like a problem, but r^2 is a bitch, and at that size both the Android UI elements and subpixels look absurdly huge. Luckily, the international SGS2&acirc;&euro;&trade;s 4.3" is completely tolerable with WVGA.</blockquote></p>
<p>A pixel format of 800x480 on a 4.3-inch display calculates to 217 ppi. At a usage distance of 12 inches those pixels will be viewable. Bump the size up to 4.5 inches and resolution falls to 207 ppi. What is needed in the world of ever larger Android smartphone displays is a jump to 1280x720. Put that pixel format on a 4.5-inch display and the resolution gets to 326 ppi, which coincidentally is exactly the same as the 3.5-inch 960x640 Retina Display.</p>
<p>&mdash;</p>
<p>* The Motorola Droid X2 has a brightness of 697 nits, the RIM BlackBerry Torch 9800 606 nits, and the Apple iPhone 4 571 nits. Comparatively speaking the Samsung Galaxy S II has terribly low brightness, meaning it would be most difficult to use in direct sunlight.</p>
