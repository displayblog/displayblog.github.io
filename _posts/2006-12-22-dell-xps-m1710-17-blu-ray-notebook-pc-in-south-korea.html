<p>Dell announced its XPS M1710 notebook PC in the South Korean market. The XPS M1710 sports a 17" LCD display with a resolution of 1920 x 1200. The special feature of this XPS is the inclusion of a Blu-ray drive. Other features include an Intel Core 2 Duo T7600 CPU running at 2.33GHz and a 667MHz FSB with 4MB of L2 cache, 512MB of dual channel memory running at 667MHz in DDR2 style, a 80GB SATA HDD spinning at 5400RPM and a 9-cell battery.</p>

<p>Now, a XPS system should be top notch because you'll be paying a lot of money for it: 3,299,000 KRW + 329,900 VAT or about US$3560 + $356 VAT. The components that I would like to see upgraded would first be the RAM to 2GB. Second, I would like to see more than 100GB of storage space in addition to a 12-cell battery, not that you'd want to run the XPS M1710 on batteries for too long. I think the battle between Blu-ray and HD-DVD is about to end soon. With Dell being one of the largest notebook PC brands in the Blu-ray camp, it is a matter of time. Unless, of course, the folks at HP decide that they'd rather go with HD-DVD. Now that would be interesting, but probably not good for the entire industry wanting to transition to a HD optical format.</p>
