<blockquote><p>[...] dark scenes feel engaging and credible.</p>
<p>We also noted more clearly with 2D just how impeccably sharp and detailed the 50PX990 is when showing HD material - and it achieves this without generating unhealthy amounts of noise or grain.</p>
<p>Motion is clear and reasonably fluid with careful/conservative use of the set&acirc;&euro;&trade;s motion processing tools, too, and colours are extremely fully saturated for a plasma TV.</blockquote></p>
<p>LG 50PX900 black levels were darker than the Samsung PS50C6900, but Panasonic is still on top. Niggles: image retention and a 60ms or so input lag.</p>
<p>The minimalistic design is beautiful but I wonder if the thin blue accents around the display were necessary. When you're watching TV on a plasma in a dark room the last thing you want to see is a blue outline.</p>
