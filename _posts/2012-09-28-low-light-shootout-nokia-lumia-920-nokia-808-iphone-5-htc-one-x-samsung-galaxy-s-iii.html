<blockquote><p>The 920 took the cake, without question, but the iPhone didn't fare too poorly itself, snatching up nearly as much light as the Nokia device. The 808 PureView also performed quite well, but the HTC One X and Samsung Galaxy S III yielded unusable results.</blockquote></p>
<p>Without a doubt Nokia knows how to build a world class smartphone.</p>
