<p>Toshiba America Electronic Components announced its TL12W01-D surface mount LED geared for residential and commercial lighting applications in addition to high-bright LCD backlights. The TL12W01-D has a dimension of 10.5 x 5.0 x 2.1 mm and generates 30 lumens with 250mA. Samples are available now.</p>
<p>LED backlighting is gaining traction for notebook PCs. Apple is the first big-named company that came out with LED backlighting for 15" and larger notebooks. Apple's 15.4" MacBook Pro sports a LED backlight that allows the LCD to conserve some power. Typically the LCD consumes the most power on a notebook PC and is often the target of power consumption reduction. Alienware's new notebook that touts dual 64GB SSDs is of notable news since SSD is expected to reduce power consumption compared to regular HDDs. Hopefully we can have notebook PCs running for 8 hours with a normal battery soon with all of these advancements. Maybe Toshiba can make that happen.</p>
