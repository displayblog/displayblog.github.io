<p>Sonos has a new and improved controller: the CR200. The 3.5-inch LCD on the CR200 boasts an impressive resolution of 640 x 480 (landscape). I'm not sure if the CR200 has an accelerometer so I'm guessing you can only use it in portrait mode. Back to the resolution: it is twice that of the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=iphone&amp;sa=Search#1474">iPhone</a>/iPod touch, which sports a 3.5-inch LCD with a resolution of just 480 x 320 (landscape). The touch technology on the CR200 is <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=capacitive&amp;sa=Search#1533">capacitive</a> so it should respond quite well to your touches.</p>
<p>For the price of US$349 that includes the charging cradle that used to cost an extra $40 the CR200 is much more affordable than the CR100 ($399) replaces. The CR200 is eminently more portable too. But I hear there is a Sonos app for the iPhone and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=ipod+touch&amp;sa=Search#1540">iPod touch</a> that basically does the same thing as the CR200. The only difference in terms of technical capability is the CR200 can make use of the Sonos mesh wireless network. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/07/27/sonos-cr200-review/">Engadget has a review</a> that might help in making a decision whether or not to upgrade to the CR200.</p>
