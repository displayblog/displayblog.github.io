<p>NVIDIA's CEO Jen-Hsun Huang via <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13924_3-20022471-64.html?tag=mncol;title">cnet</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Look at the Samsung Galaxy Tab. It's a tablet that uses a phone operating system on a large display. A tablet is not a large phone.</blockquote></p>
<p>Confusing. Is Huang saying that the Samsung Galaxy Tab is a tablet or a large phone? It doesn't matter either way. Most voice communications will be accomplished via VoIP in the near future so the concept of the phone will dramatically change. All we will need is an Internet-connected device.</p>
