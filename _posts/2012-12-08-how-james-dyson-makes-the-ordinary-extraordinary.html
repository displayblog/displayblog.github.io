<p>Shoshana Berger, <a href="http://www.wired.com/design/2012/11/mf-james-dyson/all/">Wired</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We try to make the corporation like the garage. We don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have technicians; our engineers and scientists actually go and build their own prototypes and test the rigs themselves. And the reason we do that&mdash;and I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t force people to do that, by the way, they want to do it&mdash;is that when you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re building the prototype, you start to really understand how it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s made and what it might do and where its weaknesses might be. If you merely hand a drawing to somebody and say, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Would you make this, please?&acirc;&euro;¬ù and in two weeks he comes back with it and you hand it to someone else who does the test, you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re not experiencing it. You&acirc;&euro;&trade;re not understanding it. You&acirc;&euro;&trade;re not feeling it. Our engineers and scientists love doing that.</blockquote></p>
