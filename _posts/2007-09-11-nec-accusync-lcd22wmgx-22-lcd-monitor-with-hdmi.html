The NEC LCD22WMGX is one of few LCD monitors that have an HDMI input. This is a good thing. Now, when I think of HDMI, I think of consumer electronics such as TV. When I think of TV, I think of my living room or family room. The office comes to mind, but it's not at the top of the list, by far. So, when I look at NEC's new 22" LCD monitor, I think office first: the design is very bland and although there is a picture of a cute yellow fish, I'm not convinced that this monitor should have anything to do with HDMI. Of course,if you wanted to covertly connect a gaming console (PlayStation 2 or 3, Xbox 360, etc.) while making sure that your officemates think you're a proper worker with a proper worker's monitor, then maybe the LCD22WMGX can do the trick. Not for me. I want something a bit more modern looking with a bit more bling. Oh, one more thing: the price. $380? That's just too much.</p>
