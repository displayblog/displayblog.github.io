<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20110811PD219.html">DigiTimes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>However, some notebook makers participated in the symposium are skeptical about the target prices indicating that total BOM (bill of materials) for an 11.6-inch ultrabook is expected to top US$700.</p>
<p>The sub-US$999 target price could be sustained if Intel is willing to lower its CPU prices and hand out a subsidy of US$100 per unit for marketing efforts, the sources argued.</blockquote></p>
<p>There is something fishy going on here. Why is Intel so hell-bent on getting ultrabooks off the ground? In <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/08/11/a-real-wake-up-call/"><em>A Real Wake-Up Call</em></a>, I ask:</p>
<blockquote><p>Can Intel continue to meet Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s requirement for power efficient CPUs? Is an Apple-designed ARM-based MacBook in the near future?</blockquote></p>
<p>What <em>if</em> Apple kickstarted a transition involving sub-$1000 notebooks and ARM-based CPUs? Intel would want to nip it in the bud.</p>
