<p><a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/163773/2011/12/thunderbolt_how_devices_affect_each_other_on_a_daisy_chain.html">James Galbraith, Macworld</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The reason for the performance decrease in a two-display setup is two-fold. First, the Pegasus is fast and can put plenty of bandwidth to use. Second, each Thunderbolt Display gobbles up about 7Gbps of an outbound channel&acirc;&euro;&trade;s available 10Gbps bandwidth. Display traffic is one-way, so that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s why the read speeds from the Pegasus aren&acirc;&euro;&trade;t as affected. To test this out, we attached the second Thunderbolt Display to the iMac&acirc;&euro;&trade;s second Thunderbolt port and found performance to come back to the level of a setup with just one Thunderbolt Display attached.</blockquote></p>
