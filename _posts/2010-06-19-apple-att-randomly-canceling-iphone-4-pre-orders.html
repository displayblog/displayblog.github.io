<p>According to <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/19/apple-randomly-canceling-some-iphone-pre-orders/">Engadget</a>, Apple and AT&amp;T are seemingly sending out cancellation emails to some who have pre-ordered the iPhone 4:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Customer,</p>
<p>We were unable to complete the authorization process for your iPhone order. As a result, we had to cancel your iPhone order. To complete the purchase of your iPhone, please visit an Apple Retail Store or an AT&amp;T company-owned retail store.</p>
<p>We apologize for this inconvenience.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Apple Online Store Team</blockquote><br />
The word authorization hints at the core of the problem being AT&amp;T. The iPhone 4 pre-ordering process on Apple's site connected to your AT&amp;T account to continue. Here's an email from AT&amp;T a few sent to <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5567907/att-randomly-cancelling-iphone-4-pre+orders">Gizmodo</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Your iPhone order has been cancelled.</p>
<p>Your credit card has not been charged.</p>
<p>If you believe you have received this email in error, please return to the AT&amp;T store where you placed your order.</p>
<p>Sincerely, AT&amp;T.</blockquote><br />
Some contacted AT&amp;T who responded that Apple had canceled the pre-order due to lack of supply. Apple is responding that AT&amp;T had canceled because of ineligibility. I would recommend calling both Apple and AT&amp;T to confirm your pre-order is intact. Some pre-orders are being cancelled by Apple but it seems that doesn't mean you're off the hook on a brand new two-year agreement with AT&amp;T, so call AT&amp;T and make sure you not hooked.</p>
