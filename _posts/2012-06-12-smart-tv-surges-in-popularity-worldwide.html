<p><a href="http://www.displaysearch.com/cps/rde/xchg/displaysearch/hs.xsl/120612_smart_tv_surges_in_popularity_worldwide.asp">NPD DisplaySearch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Approximately 27% of TV sets shipped worldwide had internet connectivity, led by Japan, where 46% of sets had networking capability, and Western Europe with 36%.</blockquote></p>
<p>Here we go again: shipped v. sold. TV brands increase their profit margins by pushing smart or 3D. So in Q1'12 TV brands <em>shipped</em> a whole bunch of TVs with internet connectivity. Does that mean smart TVs are now popular?</p>
