<p>The folks over at Engadget reports that Sharp's 62" high-resolution display sporting 4096 x 2048 was an experience "<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/15/sharps-4k-x-2k-64-inch-ultra-high-res-monitor/">reminiscent of sitting by a window, and not by a display.</a>" Now that sounds pretty awesome. The 62" display has a total of 8.3 megapixels signaling the arrival of display technology that match mid- to high-end image capture technologies. For the most part, image capture technology is much more advanced in terms of the total number of pixels. Partly responsible for the advanced state of image capture technology is the fact that it is based on semiconductor technology. Most semiconductor technology tend to follow "Moore's Law" with size continuing to decrease while performance increases.</p>
