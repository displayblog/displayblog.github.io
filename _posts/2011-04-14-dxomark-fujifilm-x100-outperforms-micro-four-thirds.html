<p><a href="http://www.43rumors.com/dxomark-fuji-x100-sensor-outperforms-the-best-m43-sensors/">4/3 Rumors</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>How does the Fuji sensor perform against the best m43 sensors? According to DxOmark the Fuji can deliver better results in all measured aspects (Color depth, Dynamic range and ISO performance). A bit surprising to see that the older Panasonic GH1 is the best m43 camera here.</blockquote></p>
<p>Should this be surprising? The X100 has a much larger APS-C image sensor than Micro Four Thirds. What I'd like to see is how the X100 measures up against the Sony NEX-5.</p>
