<blockquote><p>As demand for Apple's iPad is expected to turn strong for the year-end holidays, Foxconn Electronics (Hon Hai Precision Industry) recently started mass production of iPads at its new plants in Chengdu, China. Although the production lines can only manufacture about 10,000 units each day, the capacity is still expected to help satisfy demand, according to sources from upstream component makers.</blockquote></p>
<p>Most iPads are manufactured at Foxconn's Shenzhen-based facilities, which can make 2.5 million units per month. Foxconn will also be making the next generation iPad 2.0 and there is a rumor that Foxconn-related Chimei Innolux (CMI) will be a display supplier to the next iPad.</p>
