<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-18/philips-profit-falls-by-a-third-prompting-shift-of-tvs-into-joint-venture.html">Bloomberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Philips will bundle its TVs, which the Amsterdam-based company first produced in 1928, into a partnership that will be 70 percent owned by Hong Kong-based TPV Technology Ltd., it said today. Philips will retain the rest and receive royalties of at least 50 million euros ($72 million) annually starting in 2013.</blockquote></p>
<p>Philips is just continuing to exit high-tech hardware enterprises:</p>
<blockquote><p>Philips sold a semiconductor business in 2006, got out of mobile phones, and sold a personal-computer monitor business to TPV for about $358 million in 2004.</blockquote></p>
<p>And at the end of 2007 Philips divested almost all of its equity stake in LG.Philips LCD, a joint venture with LG. Just two months later the company changed its name to LG Display.</p>
