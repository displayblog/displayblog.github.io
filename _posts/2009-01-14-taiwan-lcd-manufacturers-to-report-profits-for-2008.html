excerpt: "Although Q4'08 was extremely difficult for <a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-manufacturer\">LCD
  manufacturer</a>s in Taiwan, tidy profits from the first three quarters will
  lead major Taiwan-based LCD manufacturers to report profits for 2008. Here are some
  estimates:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=au-optronics\">AU
  Optronics</a> (AUO): NT$30 billion in profits for 2008\r\nAUO reported NT$48.2
  billion in net income for the first three quarters in 2008. AUO's losses in Q4'08
  are estimated to be about NT$18 billion with a net profit for the entire year in
  2008 of around NT$30 billion.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=chi-mei-optoelectronics\">Chi
  Mei Optoelectronics</a> (CMO): NT$4.8 to $9.8 billion in profits for 2008\r\nCMO
  reported NT$24.8 billion in net income for the first three quarters in 2008. CMO's
  losses in Q4'08 are estimated to be about NT$15 - 20 billion with a net profit for
  the entire year in 2008 of around NT$4.8 to 9.8 billion.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising
  that Taiwan's two largest LCD manufacturers will post profits for the entire year
