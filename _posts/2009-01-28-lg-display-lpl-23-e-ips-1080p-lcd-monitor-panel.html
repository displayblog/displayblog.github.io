<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lg-display">LG Display</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lpl">LPL</a>) showcased a number of new LCD panels and technologies at CES and one of the more interesting things that I saw was the company's shift to lower-cost <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=ips">IPS</a>&Acirc;&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=in-plane-switching">In-Plane Switching</a>) technology. IPS is known for very high levels of color fidelity at wide viewing angles and is incorporated into the best LCD monitors out there (e.g. <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=apple">Apple</a>). The company's <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=23"">23"</a> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=e-ips">e-IPS</a> TFT LCD panel geared for LCD monitors is touted as having the same price as TN (Twisted Nematic) LCD panels. As you might already know TN LCD panels sport fairly fast response times (about 4ms) and is integrated into really affordable LCD monitors. Watch out TN, here comes e-IPS!</p>
<p>e-IPS is a detuned IPS LCD panel that makes it much less costly to manufacture but as you can see the performance hit is nowhere to be found: response time is a respectable 6ms (GTG), contrast ratio is a very good 1000:1 and the viewing angles are 178/178. Brightness is a tad low at 250 cd/m2 but definitely bright enough for LCD monitor work.</p>
<p>The Dell <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/01/15/dell-2209wa-22-lcd-monitor-with-ips-lcd-panel/">2209WA</a> seems to be sporting a 22" e-IPS LCD panel. The AU$459 MSRP of the 2209WA translates to about US$305. That certainly isn't going to win the cheapest 22" LCD monitor award but hopefully it's just Australia having higher prices for electronic goods. Let's hope we get some really nice and low-priced <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=23"-lcd-monitor">23" LCD monitor</a>s in the pipeline soon. Anyone know if there are LCD monitors already out there that sport LPL's 23" e-IPS LCD panel? If you do, please post and let everyone know.</p>
