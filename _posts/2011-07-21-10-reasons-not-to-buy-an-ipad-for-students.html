<p>Jeff Somogyi, Media Editor, <a href="http://dealnews.com/pages/10-Reasons-Not-to-Buy-an-iPad-for-a-College-Student-07-20-2011.html">dealnews.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>10. They'll Also Want a Laptop, Too</blockquote></p>
<p>True, they certainly will. I disagree with eight points that Somogyi makes, but #10 is compelling. For most students, the iPad won't work as a complete replacement for a full-blown computer like the MacBook Air. Instead, the iPad would work as a good add-on. But with many families facing financial uncertainty, certainty that tuitions will increase, and the desire to provide the right tools, I agree with the general conclusion that the iPad is not a necessity for students. If you had to go with only a single device, I would recommend one of the two MacBook Airs instead.</p>
