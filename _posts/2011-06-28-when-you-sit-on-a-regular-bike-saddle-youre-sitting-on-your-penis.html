<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/28/science/28tier.html?_r=2&pagewanted=all">John Tierney</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why, if you had an easy alternative, would you take any risk with that part of the anatomy? Even if you didn't feel any symptoms, even if you didn't believe the researchers' warnings, even if you thought it was perfectly healthy to feel numb during a ride -- why not switch just for comfort's sake? Why go on crushing your crotch?</blockquote></p>
<p>That's a good question. I'll be looking seriously at a no-nose saddle for my ride.</p>
<p>Steven Schrader, reproductive physiologist at Niosh:</p>
<blockquote><p>There's as much penis inside the body as outside. When you sit on a regular bike saddle, you're sitting on your penis.</blockquote></p>
<p>That's it; no more sitting on my penis.</p>
