<p>After Japan, Singapore got to start selling Pioneer's PDP-5000EX plasma TV that has Full HD native resolution of 1920 x 1080 on August 10. The difficulty in getting Full HD resolutions in plasma display panels (PDPs) was shrinking the cell structure. Pioneer squeezed the cell measuring only 0.576 mm and incorporates a deep-encased cell structure. A crystal emissive layer is used to improve phospher performance to get sharper, brighter images with high color fidelity. In Singapore, the Pioneer PDP-5000EX will sell for S$16,999 (~US$10,788).</p>

<p>Japan has had the PDP-5000EX since early June. Pioneer announced it as the world's first 50" plasma TV with a native resolution of 1920 x 1080 in April. The PDP uses what is called HD PURE Black Panel. The <a href="http://pioneer.jp/press/release165.html">press release</a> details Pioneer's HD PURE Black Panel technology as a combination of its Active Dynamic Range Expander (Active DRE), Digital Noise Reduction (DNR), MPEG Noise Reduction (MPEG-NR) and Flex Clear Drive technology. The PDP-5000EX has better luminance efficiency by using a Crystal Emissive Layer. Because the cells are smaller, luminance efficiency had to be increased to get to a similar level of brightness relative to PDPs with only 1366 x 768 resolution.</p>
<p>Color gamut was improved to 107% NTSC, much higher than the typical 72%, by using a Direct Color Filter technology that Pioneer developed that eliminates a glass for the front filter. The Direct Color Filter is directly slapped onto the PDP. This also reduces ambient light reflections that enable enhanced color fidelity. The PDP-5000EX has two HDMI ports, and a DVI port.</p>
