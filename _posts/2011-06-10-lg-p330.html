<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/10/new-lg-p330-laptop-has-it-all-brains-brawn-and-beauty/">Engadget</a>: The LG P330 sports a 13.3-inch narrow bezel technology LCD some refer to as <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/04/25/lg-display-shuriken-display/">Shuriken Display</a>. But from the photos online the bezels don't look particularly narrow to me. The bottom bezel, maybe following Dell's lead, is especially thick, much thicker than those on the 13.3-inch MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>Another intriguing design choice is the trackpad location: it's not centered like it is on MacBooks, but off to the left a bit. Instead of centering the trackpad based on the width of the chassis, LG decided to align it with the space bar.</p>
