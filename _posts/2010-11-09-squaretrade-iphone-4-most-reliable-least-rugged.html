<blockquote><p>The iPhone 4 was the most reliable phone, with 2.1% projected to have a non-accident malfunction in the first 12 months The major makers of Android devices, Motorola and HTC, were also very reliable, with just 2.3% and 3.7%.</blockquote></p>
<p>The iPhone is probably the most vertically integrated smartphone. Although Foxconn puts it together, Apple is in control over a lot of the internals including the software that runs it. That tight integration probably helps.</p>
<blockquote><p>Accidental damage is responsible for over 75% of smart phone failures. BlackBerry devices had the lowest one-year accident rate at 6.7%, and the iPhone 4 had the highest at 9.4%.</blockquote></p>
<p>The glass sandwich design is beautiful but unsurprisingly not rugged, at all. I would have liked a unibody design, much like the iPad but flat.</p>
