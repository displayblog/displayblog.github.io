<p>ChinaKing, also known as CKing, has shown off what is the world's first projector phone incorporating a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcos">LCoS</a>-based projector with a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led">LED</a> light source. The projected image is 30" in size with a pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=640-x-480">640 x 480</a>. Engadget is reporting that the image can be projected for up to 2 hours. Pretty impressive.</p>

<p>CKing's projector phone seems to be on the thick side, but we can expected the thickness to shrink over time. It is an impressive prototype. The iPhone UI rip is impressive too.</p>
