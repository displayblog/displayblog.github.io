<p>Want the best Android phone? Read&Acirc;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/01/technology/personaltech/01pogue.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">David Pogue</a>'s conclusion about the Motorola Droid X:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you who crave power, speed, flexibility, dropless calls an almost-Imax screen and Verizon&acirc;&euro;&trade;s network (as opposed to Sprint and its similar Evo), the Droid X is a big, beautiful contender for the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;best Android phone on the market&acirc;&euro;¬ù crown.</p>
<p>This month&acirc;&euro;&trade;s crown, anyway.</blockquote><br />
The negative:</p>
<blockquote><p>Although Android is much more open and customizable than the iPhone, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s also more complicated and less polished.</blockquote><br />
Perfect for folks who like to fiddle.</p>
