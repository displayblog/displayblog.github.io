<p><a href="http://displayblog.com/2016/08/25/amzn-tv24/">Click here for a brief description about DISPLAYBLOG&rsquo;s AMZN.TV24 market research</a>. Today we'll take a look at VIZIO. FYI, I'm certain everyone who comes to DISPLAYBLOG on a regular basis already knows this but just in case: VIZIO has been bought out by LeEco for US$2 billion late July of this year.</p>
<p>Let's get on with the data analysis. VIZIO is a well-known brand in the U.S. but on the front search result page of Amazon not many VIZIO models show up.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>4K vs. 1080p</strong></p><br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26889" src="http://displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/AMZNTV24_20160902_VIZIO4Kvs1080p.jpg" alt="AMZN.TV24 2016.09.02 VIZIO 4K vs 1080p" width="590" height="398" /></p>
<p>Up until August 30th since I started analyzing Amazon data on the 4th, all of VIZIO's TV models that showed up on the front search result page were 1080p. VIZIO's M80-C3, a 80-inch 4K LCD TV, started showing up on September 1st.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>VIZIO 4K vs. Average</strong></p><br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26888" src="http://displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/AMZNTV24_20160902_VIZIO4KvsAVG.jpg" alt="AMZN.TV24 2016.09.02 VIZIO 4K vs AVG" width="590" height="398" /></p>
<p>You can see VIZIO's share of 4K at 33% is significantly lower than the average, which is 54%. Granted there aren't a lot of VIZIO TV models to make this analysis statistically relevant, but it is interesting to see what is going on on Amazon's&nbsp;front search result page.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what I'll be sharing tomorrow, but do come back as there have been&nbsp;some interesting trends.</p>
