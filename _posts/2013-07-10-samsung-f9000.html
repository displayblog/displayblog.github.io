<p><a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130710006423/en/Samsung-Expands-Ultra-High-Definition-TV-Lineup-U.S.">BusinessWire</a>: Samsung's F9000 line of 4K LCD TVs will be available in 55-inch and 65-inch sizes for US$5500 and $7500 respectively. Pre-order starts in the U.S. on July 21. Samsung expects to ship in early August. Sounds expensive, but consider you're getting quadruple the number of pixels compared to a standard 1920x1080 set. Future proofing, at least for a few years, doesn't come cheap.</p>
