<p>In Japan, and also in South Korea, Hello Kitty is big. Really big. For girls that is. Everything that is marked Hello Kitty instantly becomes a must-have object. Parents will be nagged to death until they unwillingly succumb and purchase that Hello Kitty something. A good friend of mine who has a 5 year old daughter has filled her room with Hello Kitty stuff. Too bad for him, his little girl will be giving him an earful regarding Uniden's TL19TX1, a 19" LCD TV that has been Hello Kitty branded. Folks with daughters who love Hello Kitty better start saving up.</p>
<p>I do have to mention that this is one of the first 19" wide LCD TVs to sport a pixel format of 1440 x 810. As you might already have guessed, that's a weird pixel format since most 19" wide LCDs sport a format of 1440 x 900. Well the good folks at Uniden wanted your girl to have a proper LCD TV with a 16:9 aspect ratio.</p>
