<p>I really didn&#39;t think much of Dell&#39;s XPS Mobile Concept PC when they showed it off during CES 2006 in Vegas back in January. But, upon another look prompted by Engadget&#39;s article today, I think I might even shell out my own money to get one of those if Dell actually makes one. For one thing, although a monstrous (for something back in 2005) 17" NBPC sounds like enough is enough, the more screen real estate I have and the more pixels I have, the happier I am. The Dell XPS Mobile Concept PC rocks a 20" wide LCD. I&#39;m pretty sure the 20" wide is has the same pixel format as the one used in Dell&#39;s 20" wide LCD monitor, which is 1680*1050. That&#39;s not good enough. IMHO, I think it should have, <i>at the very least</i>, 1920*1200. More is better, but with 1920*1200, I think I would be content. I also dig how it folds into a briefcase, but I would need a few pouches to put the power supply and other goodies into. Maybe you can add that on.
