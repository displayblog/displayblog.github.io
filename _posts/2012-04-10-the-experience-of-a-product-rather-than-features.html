<p><a href="http://behindcompanies.com/2012/03/start-by-asking/">Marcelo Somers</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tasks and Features get you something functional, reliable, usable, and maybe even convenient. Organizations have trouble crossing the chasm into pleasurable and meaningful: the things that make a product exciting. When technology delivers basic needs (functional, reliable, etc.) it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the experience that dominates.</blockquote></p>
<p>I think it's impossible for organizations to do this. One or maybe a few key individuals must be 100% responsible for sculpting the experience of buying, opening, setting up, and using a product. An organization can't rub their fingers on the glass display of a smartphone and think, "There's too much friction when I slide my fingers across the display." The key to crossing the chasm from great features to wonderful experiences is to put in charge people who have great taste.</p>
