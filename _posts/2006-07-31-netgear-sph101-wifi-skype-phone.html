<p>Skype backgrounder:&Acirc;&nbsp; Skype is a service that allows a PC connected to the Internet be used like a phone by using a technology called Voice over IP (VoIP). You can call other Skype users and others and have a conversation. Now, companies such as Netgear, are coming out with devices that let you take that concept to the next level.</p>

<p>Most Skype phones that are available today require a PC. The PC must be on and not hibernating or on standby with Skype running for you to make Skype calls on a Skype phone. Enter Netgear's SPH101: No PC required. But a WiFi connection is.</p>
<p>The phone is pretty small and weighs only 0.25 lbs (0.11kg), uses WEP &amp; WPA on 802.11b and g networks. Talk time is a scant 2 hours with a 24-hour standby time. I am sure the next version, the SPH102 (?) will have improved talk and standby times. The display seems to be a fairly low resolution (QCIF?) ~2" CSTN display.<br />
The SPH101 is not cheap. At Amazon.com the unit goes for about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F76W78/sr=8-1/qid=1154360498/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-8317385-7219932?ie=UTF8">$250</a>. Belkin's F1PP000GN-SK looks very similar but goes for quite a bit less at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GTSEHQ/ref=pd_cp_e_title/104-8317385-7219932?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;v=glance&amp;n=172282">$180</a>, but is only available for preorder at this time.</p>
