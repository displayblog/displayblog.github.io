<blockquote><p>LG UD 3D TV boasts astonishing picture quality with 8 million pixels per frame, four times the resolution (3840x2160) of existing Full HD TV panels, due in large part to LG&acirc;&euro;&trade;s advanced Triple XD Engine. The additional Resolution Upscaler Plus allows images from external sources such as hard drives and user-generated content websites to be rendered in higher detail.</blockquote></p>
