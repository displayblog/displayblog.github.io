<p>Eva Dou, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323855804578511122734340726.html">The Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pegatron Corp. named after the flying horse Pegasus, will be the primary assembler of a low-cost iPhone expected to be offered later this year. Foxconn&acirc;&euro;&trade;s smaller rival across town became a minor producer of iPhones in 2011 and began making iPad Mini tablet computers last year.</p>
<p>Pegatron&acirc;&euro;&trade;s rise means an end to the monopoly that Foxconn Technology Group &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; the trade name for Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s largest electronics contract manufacturer &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; has held over the production of Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s mobile products.</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple is no longer putting all its eggs in one basket; that's good, but as far as I can tell a new low-cost iPhone remains a myth.</p>
