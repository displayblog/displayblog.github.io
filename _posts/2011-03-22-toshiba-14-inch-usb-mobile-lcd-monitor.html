<p><a href="http://www.toshibadirect.com/td/b2c/adet.to?poid=499715">Toshiba</a>: The DisplayLink-powered Toshiba 14-inch USB Mobile LCD Monitor sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and a 1366x768 pixel format. Although Toshiba thinks this portable monitor is lightweight I think it is rather portly at 2.8 lbs. But you don't have to carry an AC power adapter since power is sent <em>via</em> the USB connection. Other specs include: 16ms response time, 400:1 contrast ratio, up to 220 nits (when using the optional AC adapter), and 256K colors. What these specs tell me is that the Toshiba 14-inch USB Mobile LCD Monitor is at best mediocre. Price: US$199.99</p>
<p>What I would like to see is a really thin and light 9.7-inch USB mobile LCD monitor with IPS and 1024x768. To connect it to my iPhone 4.</p>
