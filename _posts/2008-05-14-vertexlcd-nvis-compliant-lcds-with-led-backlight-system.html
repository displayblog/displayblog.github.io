<p><strong>VertexLCD NVIS LCD</strong><br />
Size: 5.0" (640 x 480), 10.4" (1024 x 768)<br />
Backlight: LED<br />
Application: Military</p>
<p>On May 14, 2008, VertexLCD announced two TFT LCDs that feature Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) compliant <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=led">LED</a> backlight systems. Both LCDs meet NVIS Mil-3009 Type I or Type II NVIS standards and feature high brightness for use in bright ambient conditions and NVIS filters for low light applications. Possible NVIS applications include: military aircraft cockpits, tanks, trucks, ground mobile applications, etc. </p>
<p>I'm not a military expert so the term NVIS is new to me. Let's dig in a bit. NVIS requirements are covered by MIL-L-85762A and MIL-STD-3009. NVIS displays for cockpit applications have the following trends: wide viewing angles for cross cockpit viewing and multiple display.</p>

<p>As you can see from the picture above, the cockpit of a Gulfstream C-37 contains no less than 8 square LCDs that must be easily viewable in direct sunlight (look at the bottom two LCDs that are in direct sunlight). Some of the main features of NVIS requirements include: black on the display must appear black when using NVG goggles, reflections must be minimized from LCD glass, the red primary color must be solid when in NVIS mode.</p>
<p>With the LED backlight power consumption is reduced, lifetimes are increased and reliability is enhanced: critical features for military applications. VertexLCD will showcase the NVIS compliant LCDs at the upcoming SID International Symposium.</p>
