<p>[ <a href="http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MC914LL/B/apple-thunderbolt-display-27-inch?fnode=8a">Apple</a> ] The 27-inch Thunderbolt Display sports a pixel format of 2560x1440 for US$999. That's expensive. If you're a color professional looking for a 27-inch IPS monitor there are better (color bit depth, color gamut, color accuracy, etc.) more affordable options, like the <a href="http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&l=en&s=bsd&cs=04&sku=210-AGGP">$800 Dell UP2716D UltraSharp 27-inch monitor</a>.</p>
<p>[ <a href="http://www.imore.com/apple-discontinues-thunderbolt-display">iMore</a> ] Rene Ritchie:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple is discontinuing the Thunderbolt Display, the standard resolution, external IPS monitor the company has been selling since 2011. An Apple spokesperson provided us with the following statement:</p>
<p>"We're discontinuing the Apple Thunderbolt Display," Apple told iMore. "It will be available through Apple.com, Apple's retail stores and Apple Authorized Resellers while supplies last. There are a number of great third-party options available for Mac users."<br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>The 5K iMac makes it clear Apple is moving away from 2560x1440 and toward 5120x2880 at 27 inches. Will Apple come out with a standalone 27-inch 5K monitor? My bet is on yes. The reason is the Mac Pro, and to a lesser extent the MacBook Pro. The Mac Pro doesn't come with a monitor, and a good monitor makes a big difference in our computing experience, especially when it comes to processing videos and photographs.</p>
<p>I believe Apple is serious about user experience so I think Apple will come out with an excellent 27-inch 5K 5120x2880 monitor to pair with a Mac Pro or a MacBook Pro. The macOS user experience depends on it.</p>
