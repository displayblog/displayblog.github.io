<p><a href="http://www.ubergizmo.com/15/archives/2010/10/rumor_apple_booking_all_of_samsungs_amoled_display_stock.html">Ubergizmo</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple has been purchasing large quantities of Samsung's AMOLED displays, in fact, the rumor claims that Apple has snapped up virtually all of Samsung's Super AMOLED stock for 2011, leaving the Korean company to switch its Galaxy S and Wave phones to LCD displays instead.</blockquote></p>
<p>Ridiculous. What AMOLED display? The 3.7-inch that's used for the Samsung Galaxy S phones? That would mean the iPhone 5 will sport a different sized display and one that would have less pixels: 3.5-inch 960x640 Retina Display versus 3.7-inch 800x480 PenTile Matrix AMOLED.</p>
