<p>Sharp began volume production at its G8 line, Kameyama Plant No. 2, in August 2006. The company's G8 line is the world's largest and with a glass input capacity of 15,000 units per month and as a result Sharp has the lead in efficiently manufacturing 50" and larger LCD TV panels. The company has decided to pull in the scheduled start for its second line at its G8 plant from March 2007 to January 2007 resulting in doubling the capacity to 30,000 glass substrate inputs per month. The G8 glass substrate is the largest in the world with a dimension of 2160 x 2460mm that allows for six cuts of 52" LCD panels.</p>
<p>Look forward to a Sharp-branded 52" LCD TV that will be aggressively priced toward the end of this year. I'm hoping the price will be $2999 by Black Friday for a Sharp 1080p 52" LCD TV!</p>
