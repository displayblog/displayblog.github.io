<p><a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/aboutsamsung/news/newsIrRead.do?news_ctgry=irnewsrelease&news_seq=19897">Samsung</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Display Panel Business recorded an operating loss of 210 billion won on revenue of 7.09 trillion won, down 9-percent in sales compared with the same period last year.</blockquote></p>
<p>LCD panel shipments increased mid-10% range Q/Q, but inventory levels remained high. LED-backlit LCDs for notebooks and monitors increased, but 40-inch and larger TV panels dropped. Samsung plans to focus on LCD panels for 3D and Smart TVs for the third quarter. That's interesting, I prefer dumb 2D TVs.</p>
