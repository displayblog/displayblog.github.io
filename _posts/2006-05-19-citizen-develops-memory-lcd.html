<p>A new LCD developed by Citizen Watch Co. that gives you the Eco-Drive watch techology (which I think is really cool) has developed a passive matrix LCD that continues to display information even when turned off. Power consumption is only 2% of conventional LCDs to display similar information. I&#39;m not sure how this works, but cholesteric liquid crystals can be stabilized resulting in the image to continue being displayed without needing much power. Even when turned off the Citizen-developed memory LCD will require a very small amount of power.</p>
