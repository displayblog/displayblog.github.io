Starting 2010, AUO plans to invest more than &acirc;&sbquo;&not;191 million (about US$288 million) to establish a LCD module (LCM) plant. AUO Slovakia, located in the city of Trencin, will become AUO's European production base with an area of around 200,000 square meters. AUO is strategically developing its capability to serve the European LCD TV market, which roughly makes up 30% of global demand.
