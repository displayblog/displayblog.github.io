<p>Alec Shapiro, Sony Professional Solutions of America senior vice president <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.etcenter.org/2011/04/nab-perspectives-sony%E2%80%99s-shapiro-on-oled%E2%80%99s-potential-for-dominance-and-3d-advances/">Entertainment Technology Center</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sony&acirc;&euro;&trade;s NAB booth is dominated with new camcorders, 3D gear, and advances in 4K and HDCAM-SR recording options but it is the thinnest of products, reference-grade OLED monitors, that Alec Shapiro, Sony Professional Solutions of America senior vice president, points to as the biggest game changer today. And for good reason: it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the first flat-panel monitor that can truly lay claim to the CRT monitor crown for reference work.</blockquote></p>
<p>The newly-announced <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/04/12/sony-trimaster-el-pvm-2541-pvm-1741-professional-oled-monitors/">Trimaster EL</a> professional OLED monitors, though outrageously expensive, meet the front screen performance of CRT monitors according to Shapiro. I agree that an OLED future is inevitable but it might take a long time.</p>
