<p>During SID 2007, I was given a demonstration of <a href="http://www.explay.co.il/index.php">Explay</a>'s oio, a&Acirc;&nbsp;laser &amp; LED-based hybrid nano-projector. The picture quality was&Acirc;&nbsp;surprisingly&Acirc;&nbsp;good despite being generated from a projector the size of a deck of cards. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/02/07/explay-announces-new-oio-companion-led-nanoprojector/">Engadget</a> just posted a blog stating that Explay's oio Companion will be showcased at the <a href="http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/homepage.htm">Mobile World Congress</a> that will be held next week, Feb. 11 through 14,&Acirc;&nbsp;in Barcelona.</p>

<p>The laser & LED hybrid structure allows the picture to be in focus all the time.&Acirc;&nbsp;I am quite certain the prototype that I saw last year was battery powered and it should be since the oio Companion will be used mostly in on-the-go and mobile office situations. Those who are in sales that need to make frequent presentations and often in not-so-large meeting rooms would find something like Explay's oio Companion a lifesaver. In addition to having a diminuative size and being lightweight, the nano-projector allows the business traveler to forgo larger notebook PCs and simply carry the smallest and lightest&Acirc;&nbsp;(with a usable keyboard).</p>
