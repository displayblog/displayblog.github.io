<blockquote><p>But just as Ive was considering a return to England, his luck changed. In 1997, Steve Jobs returned to Apple after an absence of 12 years. He purged the company, dropping most of its products and dispensing with staff. Eventually, Jobs took a tour of the design department, then based across the street from Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s main campus.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&tilde;Jobs comes in, looks at all Ive&acirc;&euro;&trade;s amazing prototypes and says, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;My God, what have we got here?&acirc;&euro;¬ù&acirc;&euro;&trade; says Kahney.</blockquote></p>
