<p><a href="http://olympus-imaging.jp/product/dslr/epl1s/index.html">Olympus</a> (Japan) &rarr; <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/11/olympus-tweaks-pen-lite-with-faster-quieter-lens-higher-iso/">Wired</a>: Olympus made some small changes to the PEN EPL-1 and now offers you its PEN Lite EPL-1s. Maximum ISO is doubled from 3200 to 6400 and overall weight was reduced a bit.</p>
<p>The big change is a new M.ZUIKO DIGITAL 14-42mm II &AElig;&rsquo;3.5-5.6 kit lens, which is 25% lighter (112g) and sports a silent, faster, internal-focus AF motor. The display is a 2.7-inch "Hyper Crystal LCD". The EPL-1s is a Japan-only affair for now and will launch on December 4th.</p>
