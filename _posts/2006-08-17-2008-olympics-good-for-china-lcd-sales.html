<p>Here we go again. I am sure there will be endless press that attempts to look at the crystal ball for glimpses of what the impact of the 2008 Olympics will be on LCD sales in China. Didn't we go through this with the World Cup? Didn't we realize that we don't know? Half of the articles I read said that LCD TV sales were great in Europe while the other half talked about "less-than-expected deman" for LCD TVs during the World Cup.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mg.co.za/articlepage.aspx?area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__business/&amp;articleid=280756">Mail&amp;Guardian Online</a> seems to think that flat-panel TV sales will increase because of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. A Japanese study is forecasting that 25% of TVs sold in 2008 will be either LCD or plasma, compared to only 10% in 2005. 42 million TVs were sold in China in 2005.</p>
<p>I don't think the Olympics will have any impact on the flat-panel TV market. People will think about getting to a friend's house to watch the Olympics. People will find ways to watch the Olympics on their notebooks. People will use their mobile phones to get highlights of the Olympics. People will use what they have. It will be another great year for flat-panel TVs, no doubt, but not because of the Olympics. At least, that's what I think.</p>
