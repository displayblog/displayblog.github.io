<p><a href="http://www.nemoptic.com/content.php?section=news&cat_id=7&id_news=58">Nemoptic</a> combined a full-color OLED with a low-power black-and-white reflective bi-stable display. Sounds expensive and reminds me of Pixel Qi's already-in-production LCD that allows you to turn off the backlight and get you in full reflective mode.</p>
