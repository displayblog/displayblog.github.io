<p>BenQ's W9000 is a 1080p front projector that is compatible with SDTV (480i, 480p, 576i) and HDTV (576p, 720p, 1080i and 1080p). The chip is TI's Dark Chip 3 DLP. Contrast ratio ranges from 4,400:1 to 10,000:1 (in High Contrast mode). The W9000 uses a 8-segment color wheel that is a bit better than the usual 6-segment. The DLP has a refresh rate of 300Hz that is plenty fast for flicker-free video. There are a lot of inputs: component, S-video, composite, HDMI, RGB-HD.</p>

<p>I hope BenQ priced the W9000 at a reasonable price, somewhere under $3000. For those that like very large pictures (80"+) and have a fairly dark environment to setup a 1080p front projector, a device like the W9000 that puts out 1080p is the way to go.</p>
