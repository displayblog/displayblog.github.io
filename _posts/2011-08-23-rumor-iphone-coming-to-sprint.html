<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903327904576526690675657466.html">The Wall Street Journal</a>:</p></p>
<blockquote><p>Sprint Nextel Corp. will begin selling the iPhone 5 in mid-October, people familiar with the matter said, closing a huge hole in the No. 3 U.S. carrier's lineup and giving Apple Inc. another channel for selling its popular phone.</blockquote></p>
<p>Sprint has about 50 million subscribers. Verizon and AT&amp;T has roughly 100 million each. According the latest NPD Mobile Phone Track service analyzed by <a href="http://www.splatf.com/2011/08/npd-iphone-2q11/">Dan Frommer</a>, the best-selling phones in the U.S. during the second quarter:</p></p>
<ol>
<li>Apple iPhone 4</li>
<li>Apple iPhone 3GS</li>
<li>HTC EVO 4G</li>
<li>HTC Inspire 4G</li>
<li>Samsung INTENSITY II</li><br />
</ol></p>
<p>Of note, third-placed HTC EVO 4G is Sprint's best-selling smartphone. If the iPhone is in fact coming to Sprint, I wonder how other brands, in particular HTC, will fair. Verizon sold 4.5 million iPhones in the second quarter.</p></p>
