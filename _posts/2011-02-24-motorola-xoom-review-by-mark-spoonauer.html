<blockquote><p>As you might imagine, the real focus of attention is the Xoom's 10.1-inch display (1280 x 800 pixels). We could easily tell that this panel was sharper than the iPad's 9.7-inch screen (1024 x 768) when we loaded NYTimes.com. The Xoom displayed several more headlines without having to scroll down. Both screens are about as bright, but the Xoom's screen had a cooler, bluish cast compared to the iPad's warmer, yellowish tones. However, the IPS screen on the iPad has wider viewing angles, and we noticed that the Xoom's panel picked up fingerprints faster.</blockquote></p>
<p>The resolution difference: 149.45PPI on the Xoom versus 132PPI on the iPad. The Xoom, without question, has a higher resolution, in other words pixel density, but it's surprising the difference in resolution could be so easily detected.</p>
