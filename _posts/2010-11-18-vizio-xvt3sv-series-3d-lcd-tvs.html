<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/17/vizio-launches-latest-xvt-series-hdtvs-new-blu-ray-players-with/">Engadget</a>: The Vizio XVT3SV series of 3D LCD TVs come in three sizes: 42, 47, and 55 inch. All feature edge-lit LED backlights, which is great for making TVs thin, at the expense of picture quality. If picture quality is important look for TVs with full LED backlights: light that comes from the back. The XVT3SV 3D TVs sport a 480Hz frequency to blast RealD-processed 3D images. Active-shutter 3D glasses are not included. The XVT3SV series from Vizio is available through Sam's Club, Target and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dvizio%2520xvt3sv%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&tag=displ0f-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957">Amazon</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=displ0f-20&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. Purchase one of these using the Amazon link and I'll get a little kickback.</p>
