  x 800 pixel format and is lit by a LED backlight. As you can see from the picture,
  everything is glossy and results in quite a bit of reflection. Of course, if you're
  sitting right in front of it, reflections are minimized.\r\n<p style=\"text-align:

<p>There is an abundance of ports for the X360 including HDMI out, in addition to VGA. The X360 beats out the Air in storage category with the option of a bigger 128GB SSD or a faster and larger 5400RPM 120GB HD. Like the Air, there is no integrated optical drive, but there is a docking port where I would assume an optical drive is present. An Ethernet port is right there for you to connect to the Net if there are no WiFi hotspots around and you're not toting a 3G card. The X360 will keep you running at full speed for up to 10 hours, even more if you carry an extra battery, an option that isn't on the Air.</p>
<p>Samsung's X360 is a decently designed 13.3" notebook PC but does not come close to meeting the sexiness of the MacBook Air. In terms of utility, the X360 can run circles around the Air. If you live in the US, don't hold your breath since Samsung doesn't export its notebook PCs to the US. I wish they did.</p>
