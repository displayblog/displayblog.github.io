<p>[ <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-07/amazon-s-story-time-is-kind-of-a-bummer">Bloomberg Businessweek</a> ] Josh Eidelson & Spencer Soper:</p>
<blockquote><p>In an effort to discourage stealing, Amazon has put up flatscreen TVs that display examples of alleged on-the-job theft, say 11 of the company&rsquo;s current and former warehouse workers and antitheft staff. The alleged offenders aren&rsquo;t identified by name. Each is represented by a black silhouette stamped with the word &ldquo;terminated&rdquo; and accompanied by details such as when they stole, what they stole, how much it was worth, and how they got caught&mdash;changing an outbound package&rsquo;s address, for example, or stuffing merchandise in their socks. Some of the silhouettes are marked &ldquo;arrested.&rdquo;</blockquote></p>
<p>Deep down most of us want to be better human beings today than who we were yesterday. Instead of shaming, Amazon should try inspiring: inspire warehouse workers to be people of integrity. That's hard, but worthwhile. This? Isn't.</p>
