<p>I must say Andrew Kim of Minimally Minimal takes the best product photos anywhere on the Internet. I prefer his photos even to those on Apple.com. The reason why I'm talking about photos instead of the iPad Air is because unless you actually hold it in your hands you can't get a good feel for the things that make the iPad Air significantly better than previous iPads. <a href="http://www.minimallyminimal.com/blog/ipad-air">Andrew Kim's photos of the iPad Air</a> are the next best thing. The photo above is a perfect example (I did transform it with Silver Efex): The iPad Air looks like it is floating.</p>
<p>Simply, the iPad Air is a thinner, lighter, more powerful iPad. And as it has been with previous generations the price is the same and starts at US$499. Am I getting one? No, I already have an iPad (3) and will upgrade when the next one comes with Touch ID. Fingers crossed.</p>
