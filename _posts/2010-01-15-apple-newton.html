<p>Daring Fireball's John Gruber's take on one of the many reasons why Apple's Newton failed:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Newton was a pre-Internet concept that debuted at the start of the Internet revolution. All modern computers are now seen as communication devices. The Newton wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t designed around that. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m not arguing that Apple should have somehow invented Wi-Fi in 1993, but rather that the lack of any wireless IP networking was the biggest factor that kept the whole concept from being compelling to enough people to make it a hit. The Palm Pilot wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t any more of an Internet device when it debuted, but it didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have to be, because it cost less.</blockquote><br />
Definitely worth reading the entire post titled "<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/01/the_original_tablet">The Original Tablet</a>" in light of what most experts agree will be an <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/01/05/apple-event-on-january-27-2010/">unveiling of Apple's next tablet on the 27th</a>.</p>
