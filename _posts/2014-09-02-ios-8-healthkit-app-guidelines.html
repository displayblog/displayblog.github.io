<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#healthkit">Apple</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>27.3 Apps using the HealthKit framework that store users&acirc;&euro;&trade; health information in iCloud will be rejected</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/09/02/ibrute-to-hack-password-eppb-to-download-icloud-backupuse-ibrute-to-hack-password-use-eppb-to-download-icloud-backup/">That's good</a>, I guess. I wonder why Apple doesn't think iCloud is a secure storage option for sensitive information. (Seriously.)</p>
<p>Maybe Apple's new A8 chip, in addition to an improved M8 Motion Coprocessor, will have a secure enclave &mdash; H8 Health Coprocessor? &mdash; for health-related data captured by HealthKit apps and connected accessories.</p>
