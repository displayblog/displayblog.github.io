<p>If the iPhone is your computer then this will make your fingers happy: now you can connect a Bluetooth keyboard to your jailbroken iPhone thanks to the BTstack Keyboard app. Engadget played with the $5 app&Acirc;&nbsp;bought from the Cydia store and the experience? "... delightfully rapid responsiveness throughout..." There's a video too.
