<p><a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/telecomengine/20130520005533/en/Samsung-Display-Showcasing-State-of-the-Art-Mobile-Extra-Large-Sized-Displays">BusinessWire</a>: Here's the list of what Samsung Display showcased during SID 2013:</p>
<ul>
<li>4.99-inch Full HD OLED with 94% Adobe RGB color gamut</li>
<li>Diamond Pixel technology that improves text reproduction with less jaggies</li>
<li>85-inch Ultra HD TV LCD panel with local dimming and direct LED backlight resulting in 30% lower power consumption</li>
<li>10.1-inch 2560x1600 LCD for tablets: 30% less power consumption compared to typical tablet LCDs due to reduced number of driver ICs and increased LED BLU efficiency</li>
<li>13.3-inch 3200x1800 LCD for notebooks</li>
<li>23-inch 10-point multitouch LCD</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>What is most interesting to me is the 13.3-inch LCD with a 3200x1800 pixel format for a total of 5.8 million pixels (MP) and a resolution of 276 ppi. If Samsung puts this LCD into a notebook it would best the best:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2013/02/07/google-chromebook-pixel/">Chromebook Pixel</a>: 2560x1700, 4.4 MP, 239 ppi</li>
<li><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2012/08/10/13-inch-macbook-pro-with-retina-display/">13-inch retina MacBook Pro</a>: 2560x1600, 4.1 MP, 227 ppi</li>
<li><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2013/04/17/toshiba-kirabook/">Toshiba KIRAbook</a>: 2560x1440, 3.7 MP, 221 ppi</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Higher resolution equals smoother text, but without a powerful CPU and/or GPU more pixels generally means laggy performance and more power consumption. Perhaps Samsung Display reduced the number of driver ICs, improved the efficiency of the LED BLU, and lowered power consumption by 30% on the 13.3-inch LCD as it did with the 10.1-inch 2560x1600 LCD for tablets.</p>
