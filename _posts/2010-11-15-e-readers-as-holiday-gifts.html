<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/15/business/media/15ereader.html?_r=2&ref=technology">The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Carolyn Reidy, president and chief executive of Simon & Schuster, said she expected e-book sales to shoot up on Christmas Day, when people open up their e-readers and immediately start buying books.</blockquote></p>
<p>I would rather receive a nice hardback or leather-bound book, hold it in my hand, enjoy the beautiful typography as I flip each page made with cotton fibers. The "pixel density" of the book's text will be beyond anything that an e-reader has. Contrast will be superb. Tactile feedback will be optimum. Not only that the book will be durable and last for quite some time.</p>
