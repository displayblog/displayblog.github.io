<p>Hitachi's P42T501 is a 42" plasma display panel (PDP) TV that sports a pixel format of 1024 x 1080. The pixel format does not show it, but the P42T501 has a 16:9 aspect ratio. PDP TVs have always had pixel structures that are not squares but rectangles. The P42T501 features the Picture Master HDII image processor to increase sharpness and improve color. Contrast ratio is 10,000:1 thanks to its dynamic contrast electronics. There are two HDMI inputs as well as the ability to rotate 30 degrees either to the left or right. Finally, there is a SD card slot and a USB connection. Source: <a href="http://www.efytimes.com/efytimes/fullnews.asp?edid=16897">EFYtimes.com</a></p>
