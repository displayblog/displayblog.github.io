<p>Guy Kawasaki <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/apple-survived-80s-thanks-to-one-piece-of-software-says-guy-kawasaki/90024">Cult of Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>PageMaker was a bright spot that created this gigantic bright spot &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; desktop publishing. Desktop publishing &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; it saved Apple. It was a gift from God to save Apple. There is no other explanation for the survival of Apple than it is evidence of a benevolent god.</blockquote></p>
<p>That was Aldus PageMaker, the original desktop publishing software on the Mac. Regarding the original Mac, Kawasaki thinks it was a, "piece of crap, a revolutionary piece of crap.&acirc;&euro;¬ù In light of what we have now the original Mac might look as though it was merely a piece of crap but at that time it was cutting edge precisely because a rogue team of brilliant minds put together something that completely and forever changed the way we interact with a personal computer. That's <em>some</em> piece of crap.</p>
