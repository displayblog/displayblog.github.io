<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/08/sharing_the_stage">John Gruber</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But the more I think about it, the less sense it makes for the iPhone to even share the stage at the announcement with any other product. The iPhone is too big, too cool, and garners too much attention &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; and it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s in Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s interest to keep that attention undiluted.</blockquote></p>
<p>This makes sense if Steve Jobs was presenting. This doesn't make sense when no one at Apple can keep the audience for more than fifteen minutes. No one except for maybe Jonathan Ive, but I doubt Ive will be the one announcing the next iPhone. So the September event, to make it a properly exciting Apple event, will need more than just the next iPhone and iOS 6; it will need everything: iPad mini, new iPod touch, etc.</p>
