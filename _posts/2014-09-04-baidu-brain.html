<blockquote><p>With about 100 billion digitally simulated neural connections, Baidu&acirc;&euro;&trade;s computing cluster will be 100 times more powerful than the 2012 Google Inc. project dubbed &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Google Brain,&acirc;&euro;¬ù Andrew Ng, chief scientist at the operator of China&acirc;&euro;&trade;s biggest search engine, said in an interview yesterday. Engineers at a Baidu lab in Silicon Valley are designing the project, which will be built in Beijing and completed in about six months, according to Ng.</blockquote></p>
<p>Baidu's deep learning system will also be ten times more powerful than the <a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/">Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a>.</p>
