<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/04/hd-101-what-is-local-dimming/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Well in non-edgelit LED LCDs TV, there's an array of LED lights behind the liquid crystal pixels, and local dimming is when sections of the LED array are turned off or dimmed to help produce the deep blacks -- like Kuro deep. But while this tech can produce very deep blacks and fantastic contrast, there's a catch, it also create an artifact referred to as a halo around bright objects.</blockquote></p>
<p>A bunch of tiny LEDs, in the hundreds if not thousands, are used in full LED backlights to light up LCDs. These are the "LED TVs" you want, not the kind where the LEDs are on the edges of the TV. Local dimming is most effective when the LCD TV has a full LED backlight. Of course if you wanted the blackest of blacks you should consider a Panasonic plasma TV with KURO DNA.</p>
