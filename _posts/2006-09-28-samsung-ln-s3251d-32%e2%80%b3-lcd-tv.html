<p>Samsung&acirc;&euro;&trade;s new LN-S3251D is a 32&acirc;&euro;&sup3; LCD TV that has a retail price of $1,800. Adrienne Maxwell over at Home Theater seems to think that the $1,800 is a great price and wonders if Samsung cut any corners. Well, let me break it to you: $1,800 for a 32&acirc;&euro;&sup3; LCD TV is about $600-$800 too expensive in my book. You should be able to get a decent 40&acirc;&euro;&sup3;-class LCD TV for that price. For about $2000 or so, you should be able to get a 40&acirc;&euro;&sup3;-class LCD TV with 1920 x 1080 resolution! Continuing with the LN-S3251D&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; it has two HDMI ports, a VGA connection, and tuners: ATSC and NTSC.</p>

<p>Actually, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-LNS3251D-Wide-Integrated-Tuner/dp/B000ELSY0I">Amazon</a> has it for less than $1200 and that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s about where the price should be. The resolution is a limited 1366 x 768 with brightness at 500 cd/m2. Amazon&acirc;&euro;&trade;s specification adds &acirc;&euro;&oelig;super-fast&acirc;&euro;¬ù to a response time of only 8ms. Contrast ratio is a respectable 4,000:1 (this is dynamic contrast ratio) with a 178-degree viewing angle. Most consumer-grade LCD TVs have 8-bit sub-pixels that generate 256 colors, each for RGB. But to make sure that these colors are processed accurately, they are processed using 10-bit algorithms and such is the case with Samsung&acirc;&euro;&trade;s LN-S3251D. The overall design looks pleasing enough, but I would strongly recommend getting something slightly bigger so you can enjoy beautiful pictures at a full 1920 x 1080 resolution.</p>
