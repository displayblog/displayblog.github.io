<p>Dell's UltraSharp U3011 has not been announced but there has been leaks. The 30-inch LCD monitor sports an IPS LCD panel featuring a 2560x1600 pixel format. The H-IPS panel supplied by LG Display (LGD) is an 10-bit LCD with these specs: 1000:1 contrast ratio, 370 cd/m2 brightness, 7ms response time, 178-degree viewing angles, billions of possible colors. Connectivity options include two HDMI, two DVI, and one DisplayPort.</p>
<p>Apple's 30-inch Cinema HD Display costs an astounding US$1799 and the new 27-inch LED Cinema Display (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/07/27/apple-27-inch-led-cinema-display-2560x1440-ips-lcd-led-backlight/">here are my initial thoughts</a>) with a 2560x1440 pixel format is a much more affordable $999. In my opinion, Dell will have to price its 30-inch a lot closer to the 27-inch from Apple to be competitive.</p>
