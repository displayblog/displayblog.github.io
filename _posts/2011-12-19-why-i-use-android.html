<p><a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/12/12/whyIUseAndroid.html">Dave Winer</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Right now it's the only open source mobile OS that has a chance against IOS. If there is no alternative to IOS then Apple will have exclusive control over what makes it to market. That is a future none of us should want to live in.</blockquote></p>
<p>I like the way <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/12/19/flip-side">John Gruber</a> puts it:</p>
<blockquote><p>A different perspective would be that Google is the bigger threat, and that using Apple products is a way to better protect our privacy and personal information.</blockquote></p>
<p>If there is no alternative to Android then Google will have exclusive control over what makes it to market. I just want to point to the WinTel-dominated PC market in the 1990s. It wasn't very exciting then, and it's not very exciting even now. Imagine a WinTel-like Android monopoly in the smartphone market. That would suck.</p>
