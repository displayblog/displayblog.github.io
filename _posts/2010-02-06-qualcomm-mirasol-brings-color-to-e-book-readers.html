<p>Qualcomm's Mirasol display technology can display full color consuming very little power. It consumes no power when the display is not being updated, just like E Ink displays. Add to that video playback capability thanks to a response time that blows any LCD out the window and Mirasol technology is already better than E Ink by a big margin. Qualcomm is planning to produce a 5.7-inch Mirasol display with a pixel format of 1024 x 768. That's interesting because the much larger 9.7-inch TFT LCD used in the iPad sports the same number of pixels. Imagine a Kindle 2 with color, video playback capability, and touch (read <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/02/03/amazon-buys-touchco/"><em>Amazon Buys Touchco</em></a>). Yowzer!
