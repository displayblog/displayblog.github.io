Samsung unveiled its T-series LCD monitors at CeBIT 2008. The noteworthy T-series sizes are the 24" and 26" versions. Both have a pixel format of 1920 x 1200 and a dynamic contrast ratio of 20,000:1 and a response time of 5ms. You also have the option of adding a DTV tuner. The dynamic contrast ratio is an amazing 20,000:1 with acceptable response times of 5ms.<br />

There is nothing wrong with good design geared toward business. I think all of the "chiefs" would appreciate that. But when you pitch your products to the guys in IT, I would be surprised if the decision maker gives a whoot about different colors, cool design, or even the HDMI port. He or she would probably ask about a cheaper but just as capable version, and without the HDMI port. Why did Samsung add that HDMI port? And what's with the DTV tuner option? Do they think corporations worldwide are now wanting their workers to hook up their 360s and PS3s via HDMI and play games and/or even watch TV while they are working?<br />

Redo the marketing and take these to the consumers who would actually value the design, the ports, and the tuner option.<br />
