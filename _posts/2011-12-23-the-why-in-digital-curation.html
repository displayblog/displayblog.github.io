<blockquote><p>I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m thinking the term &acirc;&euro;&oelig;curator&acirc;&euro; shouldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be thrown out just yet. What we know as digital curation is such a unique beast that no other word seems to really fit. Traditional curators are often degree-holding specialists trusted with their materials. Translating this idea to the digital world places emphasis on content that I find very good for web culture. It shows that people place real value in the things they love. However, I think there <em>is</em> a requirement for those who use the term - one must provide some unique context or information when displaying their prized possessions. I have a hard time taking digital &acirc;&euro;&oelig;curators&acirc;&euro; seriously when all they do is throw links together. The <em>why</em> is so important to me when it comes to art.</blockquote></p>
<p>Why. Good question. For knowledge. For beauty. For truth. And sometimes just for fun.</p>
