<p>Steve Jobs <em>via</em> <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.02/jobs_pr.html">Wired</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Europeans make them much better &mdash; but they take twice as long to do clothes! [...] Most important, they don't trash your clothes. They use a lot less soap, a lot less water, but they come out much cleaner, much softer, and they last a lot longer.</blockquote></p>
