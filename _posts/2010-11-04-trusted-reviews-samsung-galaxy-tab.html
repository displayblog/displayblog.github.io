<p><a href="http://www.trustedreviews.com/laptops/review/2010/11/04/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab/p1">Trusted Reviews</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Samsung's famed screen prowess is nowhere to be seen with the Tab's 7in display sporting extremely narrow viewing angles, with washed out colours and poor handling of blacks - particularly when watching video. Why is something of a mystery since the Tab's 1024 x 600 resolution makes for a much higher pixel density than the 10in iPad, yet side by side there is no comparison.</blockquote></p>
<p>This is interesting. Just a few days ago, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/01/samsung-galaxy-tab-review/">Engadget</a> put up a review praising the viewing angles:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s notably better than most other tablet screens we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve seen of late, which, of course, means that the first thing we noticed was its stellar viewing angles.</blockquote></p>
<p>So which is it? Maybe Samsung is using different LCDs in the Galaxy Tab for different markets.</p>
