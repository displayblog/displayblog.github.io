<p><a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/22/how-nature-changes-the-brain/">Gretchen Reynolds, The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>These results &acirc;&euro;&oelig;strongly suggest that getting out into natural environments&acirc;&euro;¬ù could be an easy and almost immediate way to improve moods for city dwellers, Mr. Bratman said.</blockquote></p>
<p>Gregory Bratman is a graduate student at the Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources at Stanford University and studies how urban living affects our psychology. Bratman et al. published a paper titled "Nature experience reduces rumination and subgenual prefrontal cortex activation". You can read <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/112/28/8567.abstract">the abstract at PNAS</a> (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America), but here's the really short version: Urbanization is linked to increased levels of mental illness like depression and urbanites can improve their moods by being exposed to natural environments.</p>
