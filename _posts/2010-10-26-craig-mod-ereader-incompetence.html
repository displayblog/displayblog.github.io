<p><a href="http://craigmod.com/satellite/bad_ereaders/">Craig Mod</a> on ereader incompetence:</p>
<blockquote><p>It's scary that most of the highly-praised ereaders (such as Wired / New Yorker / Time magazine's apps) eliminate the inherent accessibility of digital text. Of course, this is a transition period, but why not start off on the right foot? Digital text isn't the same artifact that printed text is. Let's not treat it like it is.</p>
<p>Until things improve, I'll be reading those excellent long-form New Yorker pieces in Instapaper, thanks.</blockquote></p>
<p>I just use the built-in Reader feature in Safari. I am lucky that I almost always have time to read the online stuff; they are usually short enough. It maybe that I haven't realized the great benefits of Instapaper, but it hasn't become a part of my 'readflow'. Now, if I can just find time to read the real books...</p>
