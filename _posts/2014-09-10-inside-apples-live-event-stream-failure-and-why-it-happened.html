<p>Dan Rayburn, <a href="http://blog.streamingmedia.com/2014/09/why-apples-livestream-failed.html">Streaming Media</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s live stream of the unveiling of the iPhone 6 and Watch was a disaster today right from the start, with many users like myself having problems trying to watch the event. While at first I assumed it must be a capacity issue pertaining to Akamai, a deeper look at the code on Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s page and some other elements from the event shows that decisions made by Apple pertaining to their website, and problems with how they setup storage on Amazon&acirc;&euro;&trade;s S3 service, contributed the biggest problems to the event.</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple's live stream of iPhone 6 and Apple Watch event started, then I heard a foreign language being dubbed over, then it stopped. I couldn't get it to stream again and kept on receiving a message stating I didn't have access permission. I gave up trying after a while; I wasn't expecting that. So I went to The Verge and read the live blog of the event. I eventually watched the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;live stream&acirc;&euro;¬ù, late last night, after Apple posted on its website: <a href="http://www.apple.com/live/2014-sept-event/">www.apple.com/live/2014-sept-event</a></p>
