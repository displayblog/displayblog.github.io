<p><a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/07/27/apple-to-book-readers-our-way-or-the-highway/#more-65523">Philip Elmer-Dewitt</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As someone who has purchased and read several dozen books on the Kindle app in the past year, I have to say that this sucks. The Amazon bookstore on the iPad was a reader's paradise: A enormous library with open shelves that let you browse at will, check reviews and more often than not read the first chapter for free. Without that Kindle Store button, however, I suspect many users -- if not most -- will have no idea how to get started.</blockquote><br />
A quick aside: the 9.7-inch IPS LCD on the iPad is nice, but it ain't no reader's paradise. I think it's agreed almost universally that the Kindle's E Ink is <em>much</em> better for reading.</p>
<p>Ed Sutherland, <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/is-apple-policy-pushing-readers-to-kindles/106258">Cult of Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you love e-reading and the Kindle app for the iPad, you may have noticed the familiar &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Kindle Store&acirc;&euro;¬ù button missing. Its absence is causing an uproar online and prompting questions whether Apple is unintentionally pushing consumers to buy iBook alternatives.</blockquote><br />
Elmer-Dewitt is frustrated that the Kindle Store button in the Kindle iOS app was forced to be removed by Apple. I think Apple is <em>intentional</em> in driving app developers and potential customers to its iBookstore. Is this a good strategy for Apple?</p>
<p>iOS apps and iDevices are a fantastic combination: a UI optimized for fingers combined with a superbly tuned multitouch LCD is perfect. Music on iTunes? Not perfect, but better than most; Spotify is my favorite. Video on iTunes can be much better with a subscription option, which Netflix has. But books don't work very well.</p>
<p>Let's go back to the display. E Ink is much better for reading than the best LCDs. Apple doesn't bring much to the table. Amazon has a considerably larger e-book selection and the more readable Kindle. Apple has less e-books and you're reading on LCDs, whether it's on the iPod touch, iPhone, or iPad. For those of us who read a lot and want a non-analog experience Amazon is the clear winner. Apple should embrace the usage of Amazon's Kindle app.</p>
<p>This will become moot soon enough though. Amazon is working on a Kindle tablet. This is what I've heard. The Kindle tablet will come in two sizes: 7 and 10 inches. The display technology will be Hydis-developed fringe-field switching (FFS) LCD, manufactured by Chunghwa Picture Tubes (CPT) at its Gen. 6 line (<em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/07/20/e-ink-and-chunghwa-picture-tubes-form-strategic-alliance/">E Ink and Chunghwa Picture Tubes Form Strategic Alliance</a></em>). FFS is known to be as good as IPS in a number of attributes: wide viewing angles, low shifts in contrast, brightness and color. CPT has also been tapped to supply the touch panel (<em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/07/27/cpt-touch-panel-supplier-for-amazon-tablet/">CPT Touch Panel Supplier For Amazon Tablet</a></em>), which is rumored to be limited to two touches at a time (<em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/07/25/two-finger-amazon-tablet/">Two-Finger Amazon Tablet</a></em>).</p>
<p>Apple is deliberately forcing potential e-book customers to choose between its iBookstore and others. For luddites like me who would rather read a book made of paper, this is a non-issue, but for the millions who do read on displays this might feel like a conundrum. Well, it isn't really. With a move away from electrophoretic displays, Amazon loses its biggest advantage: readability. Amazon, with its new tablets, will inadvertently join Apple's game, a game Apple has been winning for some time.</p>
<p>PS: A reader's paradise in my mind is a drink, silence, and plenty of time to read a good book.</p>
