<blockquote><p>Philips' Cinema 21:9 platinum is undoubtedly the most technologically advanced screen you can buy and challenges Samsung's UE55C9000 as the most desirable. It takes superb pictures, boasts solid audio and extensive features and wraps them in a gorgeous, uniquely-shaped frame.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Philips Cinema 21:9 Platinum sports a 58-inch LCD with a full LED backlight. Ambilight, Philips' specialty, immerses the visual experience with content-based lighting surrounding the TV. The pixel format is also an impressive 2560x1080, so you will need to scale any and all HD content, which the 58PFL9955H seems capable of doing quite well.</p>
