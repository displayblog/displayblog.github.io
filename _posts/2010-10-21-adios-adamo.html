<p>Dell's new branding includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inspiron for mainstream products.</li>
<li>XPS and Alienware for "performance seekers".</li><br />
</ul><br />
<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE69J6CM20101021">Reuters</a>: Finally. Dell has realized how confusing its branding has been. No more Adamo. And thankfully no more stuff like Studio XPS. Alienware should also be spun out; Dell's got no business making gaming rigs.</p>
<p>Back to Adamo. The timing is interesting. Just as Apple pulls out the future of notebooks with its new ultra-thin and light MacBook Air, Dell goes out and dumps its thin and light.</p>
