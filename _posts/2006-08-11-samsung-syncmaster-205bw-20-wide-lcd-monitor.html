<p><a href="http://www.bytesector.com/data/bs-article.asp?ID=665">Bytesector</a>: Samsung's 205BW is a 20" wide LCD monitor with 1680 x 1050 resolution, a brightness of 300 cd/m2, a contrast ratio of 600:1, viewing angles of 160 degrees, a 6ms response time, a DVI and a VGA port and supports up to 16.7 million colors (8 bit TFT LCD).</p>
<p>Looking from the limited viewing angles, the 205BW uses a regular TN panel with a film that enhances viewing angles. Samsung probably stood away from using its PVA (Patterned Vertical Alignment) technology due to the cost. With PVA viewing angles are in the range of 176-178 degrees all around. Most likely due to the cost-savings associated with the use of the cheaper TN panel, prices will be much cheaper than a Dell 20" wide LCD monitor that uses a IPS (In-Plane Switching) LCD panel from LG.Philips LCD that has 178-degree viewing angles and great color fidelity at all angles. At <a href="http://www.jr.com/JRProductPage.process?Product=4121214&amp;JRSource=nsa&amp;nsa=1">J&amp;R</a> the price is $280 after a $50 rebate. For some reason <a href="http://www.compusa.com/products/product_info.asp?product_code=340150&amp;Pn=205BW_20_inch_LCD_Monitor">CompUSA</a> has a very high price of $350. There seems to be two colors: black and silver.</p>
