<p>Verizon CFO Fran Shammo <em>via</em> <a href="http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2011/04/21/apple-verizon-looking-forward-to-world-iphone/">Barron's</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The fluctuation, I believe, will come when a new device from Apple is launched, whenever that may be, and that we will be, on the first time, on equal footing with our competitors on a new phone hitting the market, which will also be a global device.</blockquote></p>
<p>This can be taken two ways. One, using Qualcomm's Gobi chipset an iPhone could work with both GSM and CDMA networks. The other take would be that the next iPhone would be a data device only.</p>
<p>I say the next iPhone, which I have been guessing will be called the iPhone 4S will work on both GSM and CDMA networks. Apple wants this to happen because making fewer models improve manufacturing efficiency, lower costs, and improves profit margins. The next step, probably next year, might be a LTE-based data-only iPhone 5.</p>
