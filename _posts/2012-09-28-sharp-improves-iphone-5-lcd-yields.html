<p>Reuters &rarr; <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/sharp-says-making-adequate-volumes-102341847.html">Yahoo</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sharp Corp is making "adequate volumes" of displays it is known to supply for Apple Inc's new iPhone5, a company executive said, indicating that a possible bottleneck in supplies of screens may have eased.</blockquote></p>
<p>The 4-inch LTPS in-cell touch IPS LCD is probably a difficult product to manufacture with high yields, but LG Display (LGD) and Japan Display Inc. (JDI) seem to have figured out how months before Apple launched the iPhone 5. In other news, <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/49205045">Sharp secures enough money to stay in business through June 2013</a>.</p>
