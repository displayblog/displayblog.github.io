<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/01/09/verizons-droid-4-finally-official/">Engadget</a>: 4-inch 960x540 and runs Android 2.3.5. Meh.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/02/10/motorola-droid-4-review/">Joseph Volpe, Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Usually when companies lock certain specs in place, it's a testament to not fixing what isn't broken. On the other hand, when that hardware detail happens to be a 4-inch, 960 x 540 PenTile LCD display, we're tempted to call it laziness. If you're possessed of a keen eye and meticulous attention to detail, then the poor contrast and low pixel density offered by the Droid 4's screen should prove to be a major turn-off. Out in broad daylight, even with brightness set to the maximum, we found ourselves continually shielding the phone so as to render its contents readable. This became particularly bothersome where photo-taking is concerned, as we were never quite able to tell what was being framed by the camera's viewfinder. Tilt slightly away from the phone and immediately you'll notice an apparent wash out, although viewing angles didn't take as drastic a hit.</blockquote></p>
<p>Again: meh.</p>
<p><em>Update 2:</em> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/14/2797056/motorola-droid-4-review">Sean Hollister, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Droid 4's four-inch qHD (960 x 540) LCD display uses a PenTile matrix, just like the Droid 3, and that means that even though it's reasonably clear and gets nice and bright, images aren't quite as fine or detailed as you'd expect from the supposed 275ppi pixel density. My old Droid 2's 3.7-inch, 854 x 480 screen shows me much crisper icons and fonts. That's not the only issue, either, as the display tends to wash out quickly when viewed from off-angles, and there's very noticeable ghosting as you swipe and scroll. It's sub-par, but especially now that lovely AMOLED screens and or 720p resolution are becoming the superphone norm, the Droid 4's LCD display feels pretty terible.</blockquote></p>
<p>I think it's pretty obvious: The 4-inch 960x540 PenTile Matrix LCD used in the Motorola Droid 4 just doesn't cut it.</p>
