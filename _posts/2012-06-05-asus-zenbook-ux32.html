<p><a href="http://www.notebookcheck.net/Review-Asus-Zenbook-UX32VD-Ultrabook.75591.0.html">J. Simon Leitner, Notebookcheck</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Full-HD on a 13" notebook sounds rather tempting on first blush, but could also lead to problems with the display size of screen elements. With <strong>166 dpi</strong> (dots per inch), the display can show contents in much more detailed fashion than the HD variant (118 dpi). But unless you adjust scaling, you will be confronted with tiny dialogs, fonts and windows. Our test model therefore defaulted to a <strong>scale of 125%</strong> and the browser enlarged things by 110%. With these settings, it was possible to work comfortably for the most part, but there is still the possibility of software issues with scaled up settings.</blockquote></p>
<p>An open ecosystem allows for a myriad of hardware choices, and that also means an acceptance that hardware and software will almost never fit perfectly. I would rather squint than have to deal with strangely sized images, icons, etc. among different applications; that would drive me nuts.</p>
<p>The good points about a 166-ppi 1920x1080 IPS non-reflective LCD: razor sharp images, great viewing angles, and perfectly fit playback of 1080p HD video. I look forward to more IPS LCDs in notebooks in the near future; I'm looking at you Apple.</p>
