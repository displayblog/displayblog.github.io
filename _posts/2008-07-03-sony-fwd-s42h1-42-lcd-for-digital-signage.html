<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=sony">Sony</a>'s FWD-S42H1 is a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=42">42"</a> LCD for <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=digital-signage">digital signage</a> applications. You can tell by looking at some interesting features. For instance, there are screw holes on the rear of the display so you can mount Sony's VSP-NS7, which is a HD player. There are additional screw holes to attach a IPELA camera on top of the FWD-S42H1 for video conferencing. The 42" display can be remotely controlled from a central location and firmware can be updated via a local area network.</p>
<p>Kind of like the iPhone, the FWD-S42H1 automatically detects whether it's in portrait or landscape orientation. Really cool for a large 42" display. Speakers are incorporated, control buttons are on the rear and the bezels are thin.</p>
<p>Here is Sony's entire press release regarding its FWD-S42H1 and the larger 47" FWD-S47H1:</p>
<blockquote><p>LAS VEGAS (InfoComm Booth #C1500) June 18, 2008 &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Sony is introducing two new LCD full high-definition displays at InfoComm this week. The new models are the 42-inch FWD-S42H1 and 47-inch FWD-S47H1 (viewable areas, measured diagonally). Each is designed for high brightness and high resolution in a range of commercial installation applications, including digital signage.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;These 1080-ready displays are perfect for public installations,&acirc;&euro; said John Holmes, marketing manager for public displays at Sony Electronics. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Their image quality, flexibility and durability meet the requests of system integrators and customers with high performance, advanced features and specifications.&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>Each model has full 1920 x 1080 resolution, ideal for displaying content in stadiums, arenas and event halls; in movie theaters to show trailers or for featuring promotional content in retail settings.</p>
<p>For digital signage applications, the displays are specially designed to accommodate Sony&acirc;&euro;&trade;s HD player, model VSP-NS7, with screw holes so users can easily mount the player to the rear of the display. The displays can also be used with a table-top stand, and additional screw holes on top allow Sony IPELA&acirc;&bdquo;&cent; cameras to easily attach for videoconferencing.</p>
<p>Each has a higher brightness than previous versions, with a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;brightness boost&acirc;&euro; setting for even brighter images. Three types of screen savers are available: standby, which is activated while the backlight is off; all-white and sweep.</p>
<p>Users can control and manage the displays remotely from a central location, with firmware upgrades available over a local area network. A &acirc;&euro;&oelig;power on delay&acirc;&euro; function shifts the power-on timing of multiple displays to avoid system power down.</p>
<p>The displays automatically detect use in landscape or portrait mode, and illuminate a logo in the appropriate orientation. Invisible speakers, rear control buttons and a slim bezel design allow the displays to easily blend into the d&Atilde;&copy;cor of any setting.</p>
<p>Each model can accept DVI HDCP IN with audio in (stereo mini), RGB/Component in/out (D-sub15pin) with audio in (stereo mini), S-video in, and composite Video in/out (BNC) with audio in (stereo mini).</p>
<p>Optional adapters add increased capabilities, including component/RGB inputs (BKM-FW11), HDMI inputs (BKM-FW15), HD-SDI/SDI inputs (BKM-FW16), monitor control (BKM-FW21) and streaming receiver (BKM-FW50).</p>
<p>The FWDS42H1 and FWDS47H1 are planned to be available in October with suggested list pricing to be announced.</blockquote><br />
