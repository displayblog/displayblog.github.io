<blockquote><p>The screen was a major highlight for us. Its vivid, punchy colors remain faithful even at oblique viewing angles and the pixel density of 800 x 480 dots within a 4-inch diagonal feels just sumptuous. In day-to-day use, you'll struggle mightily to tell a difference between this and Apple's Retina Display or Samsung's Super AMOLED stuff, the pair of whom represent the supreme panel technologies of our day.</blockquote></p>
<p>I don't think I'll be struggling much at all to tell the 40% difference in resolution between the 233-ppi 4-inch HTC Incredible S and the 326-ppi 3.5-inch iPhone 4 Retina Display. The Super AMOLED stuff, on the other hand, could be a struggle.</p>
