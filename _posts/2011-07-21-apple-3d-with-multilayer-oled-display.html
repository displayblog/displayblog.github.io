<p>Neil Hughes, <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/07/21/apple_exploring_multilayer_displays_for_three_dimensional_computing.html">AppleInsider</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple's solution is a multilayer display system that could be driven by multiple transparent organic light-emitting diode screens, or OLED. The use of multiple transparent screens would allow for layers in an image, creating visual depth for users.</blockquote></p>
<p>Now this is real 3D, meaning there is a physical z-axis component, a third dimension, with none of the visual trickery that's rampant today.</p>
