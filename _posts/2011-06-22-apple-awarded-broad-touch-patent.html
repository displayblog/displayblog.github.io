<blockquote><p>An N-finger translation gesture is detected on or near the touch screen display. In response, the page content, including the displayed portion of the frame content and the other content of the page, is translated to display a new portion of page content on the touch screen display. An M-finger translation gesture is detected on or near the touch screen display, where M is a different number than N. In response, the frame content is translated to display a new portion of frame content on the touch screen display, without translating the other content of the page.</blockquote></p>
<p>This describes how single, multi-touch, and gestures works on a capacitive touch display. Apple was awarded patent #7,966,578. Implications for the competition could be huge.</p>
