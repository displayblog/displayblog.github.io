<p><a href="http://fosspatents.blogspot.com/2011/08/preliminary-injunction-granted-by.html">Florian Mueller</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The leading German news agency, <a href="http://www.dpa.de/">dpa</a>, just <a href="http://www.financial-informer.de/infos/kreise_apple_stoppt_vertrieb_von_samsungs_ipad_konkurrent_in_europa_1646557">reported</a> that Apple has been granted a preliminary injunction against Samsung's Android-based Galaxy Tab 10.1, barring with immediate effect all distribution of the product in the entire European Union except for the Netherlands on the grounds of an alleged infringement of Apple's iPad-related [European] Community design no. 000181607-0001. I can confirm that Apple has a separate lawsuit underway in the Netherlands as well, asserting the same Community design.</blockquote></p>
<p>The ripple effect: other brands who make tablets, which to me look like iPad ripoffs, will be encouraged to innovate.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> Samsung <em>via</em> <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/08/09/apple-gets-samsung-galaxy-tab-10-1-distribution-blocked-in-european-union/">The Next Web</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Samsung is disappointed with the court&acirc;&euro;&trade;s decision and we intend to act immediately to defend our intellectual property rights through the ongoing legal proceedings in Germany and will continue to actively defend these rights throughout the world.</p>
<p>The request for injunction was filed with no notice to Samsung, and the order was issued without any hearing or presentation of evidence from Samsung.</p>
<p>We will take all necessary measures to ensure Samsung&acirc;&euro;&trade;s innovative mobile communications devices are available to customers in Europe and around the world.</p>
<p>This decision by the court in Germany in no way influences other legal proceedings filed with the courts in Europe and elsewhere.</blockquote></p>
<p>I understand PR needs to put up a defiant face under the circumstances, but phrases like "innovative mobile communications devices" sound so void of substance.</p>
