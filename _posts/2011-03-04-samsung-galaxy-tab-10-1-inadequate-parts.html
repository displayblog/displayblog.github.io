<p>Don-joo Lee, EVP Samsung Mobile Division, <em>via</em> <a href="http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/techscience/2011/03/04/9/0601000000AEN20110304009300320F.HTML">Yonhap News Agency</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We will have to improve the parts that are inadequate. Apple made it very thin.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 is 10.9-mm thick. The new iPad 2 is 8.8 mm. So that's one inadequate part.</p>
<blockquote><p>The 10-inch was to be priced higher than the 7-inch but we will have to think that over.</blockquote></p>
<p>Now that would be really interesting. The 7-inch Samsung Galaxy Tab can be had for just US$249.99 on T-Mobile, with a new two-year agreement. The total cost of ownership is $849.75, including $599.97 ($24.99 per month) and the price of the Galaxy Tab at $249.99. Not bad for a 3G-enabled tablet. If Samsung is thinking of bringing the Galaxy Tab 10.1 at a price equal to or lower than this. Wow.</p>
