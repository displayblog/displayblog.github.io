<p><a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/5430/sony-vaio-z-with-dock-se-with-ips-and-an-ultrabook-concept">Jarred Walton, AnandTech</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sony was using the SE to show their Media Gallery 2.0 software, but that wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t nearly as impressive to us as the 15.5&acirc;&euro;¬ù 1080p IPS display. (I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m always a sucker for a good display!) The word on the web is that the display isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t full sRGB on the color gamut, but then there are many laptops that fall into that category and they don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t come with a 1080p IPS panel.</blockquote></p>
<p>Is it finally time for IPS in notebooks? I hope so.</p>
