<blockquote><p>Next month, the city plans to issue an RFP (request for proposals) "that would require fiber to be run to every residence, every business, and every government entity within the city limits of Los Angeles," Los Angeles Information Technology Agency GM Steve Reneker told Ars today. The City Council this morning unanimously voted to move forward with drafting the RFP and will vote again in a few weeks to determine whether it's ready for release, he said.</blockquote></p>
<p>Building infrastructure for future growth. That's good. And it's free: That's awesome. How about you Silicon Valley?</p>
