<p><a href="http://www.isuppli.com/Display-Materials-and-Systems/News/Pages/Small-Sized-Display-Shipments-Decline-Amid-Weak-Demand-from-all-Markets&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Except-Tablets.aspx">Vinita Jakhanwal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Shipments of small- and medium-sized display (SMD) panels fell for the second straight month in May as demand decreased from cellphones and all other major product categories&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;with the major exception of tablets [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>Looking at the latest reports from Apple and Samsung would suggest smartphone demand was out of this world. iSuppli tracks small/medium displays from just Taiwan and South Korea. Excluded are Japan-based display manufacturers, some of which supply small/medium panels to Apple.</p>
<p>Still I find it difficult to believe smartphone demand is weak. Maybe the extraordinary collapse of Nokia's smartphone business has something to do with it.</p>
