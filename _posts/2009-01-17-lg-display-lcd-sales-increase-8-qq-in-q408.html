<p>LPL shipped 3.86 million square meters of net display area in Q4'08, up 5% Q/Q. LCD panel shipments for LCD TV applications accounted for 57% of the total revenue, LCD monitors 20%, notebook PCs 18% and mobile applications 5%. LCD fab utilization rates averaged 80% in Q4'08. In terms of future investments toward capacity, on January 16, 2009 the Board of Directors approved &Acirc;&nbsp;KRW 577 billion for a new <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=ltps">LTPS</a> (Low Temperature Poly-Silicon) LCD fabrication plant in Korea for themanufacture of LCDs geared for mobile applications.</p>
