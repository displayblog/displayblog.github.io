<p><a href="http://en.akihabaranews.com/68564/laptops/msi-introduces-the-fr600-3d-their-new-3d-laptop">Akihabara News</a>: The MSI FR600 3D is a 15.6-inch 3D notebook PC sporting a 1920x1080 pixel format and LED backlight. The built-in webcam is 720p capable: we should expect notebook brands to move from 640x480 to 1280x720. I think 3D glasses are included.</p>
<p>There are a lot of 3D product announcements: TVs, monitors, notebook PCs, and even mobile phones. Are you going to get one? I'm not; I don't want to fry my already-bad eyes. In <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/09/24/dvorak-3d-bad-for-your-eyes/">Dvorak: 3D Bad For Your Eyes</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What happens is this: having each eye being completely blocked out thirty or sixty times per second is the equivalent of having a high-frequency strobe going off in your face. You&acirc;&euro;&trade;re probably aware of the danger this presents to epileptics and others: seizures, nausea, and fatigue are not uncommon.</blockquote></p>
