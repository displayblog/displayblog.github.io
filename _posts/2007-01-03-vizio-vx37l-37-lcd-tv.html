<p>CNET has a review of Vizio's VX37L and gave it a mark of 6.6 out of 10. The good parts about the VX37L is the price (US$899), accurate color decoding, adjustable color temperature, brightness uniformity, and a plethora of connectivity options including a PC and dual HDMI inputs. The CNET knocks the VX37L for its SD performance, but what do you expect from a HDTV? If you're getting a HDTV, expect it to do well with HD, not SD. So, I would discount CNET's pooh-pooh on the VX37L's SD performance. Unlike CNET, the users have rated it 8.5 out of 10 as of 2006.01.03.</p>

<p>The pixel format of Vizio's VX37L is 1366 x 768, not good in my book as it will need to scale every single video source known to man. And scaling will deteriorate the video no matter how good it is. Vizio gauratees there will be no bright pixel defects and no permanent burn in. FYI, LCDs are known not to have permanent burn in problems like plasma display panels (PDPs). The PC input allows up to 1366 x 768, which is nice as there are times when you want to connect your PC to a 37" LCD TV. The Mac mini comes to mind. Response times are 8ms, brightness is 500 cd/m2, contrast ratio is 1000:1 and the viewing angles are 178-degrees. Colors are at 8-bit generating 16.8 million colors. Pretty standard.</p>
<p>If the pixel structure was 1920 x 1080. If the bottom speaker portion didn't have that little indent in the middle. If a wide color gamut CCFL was used to generate 90% NTSC. If the price was still $899...</p>
