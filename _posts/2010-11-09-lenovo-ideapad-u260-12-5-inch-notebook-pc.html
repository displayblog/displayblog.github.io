<p><a href="http://www.thinkpads.com/2010/11/08/lenovo-quietly-announces-new-12-5-inch-ultraportable-ideapad-u260/">ThinkPads.com</a> &rarr; <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/09/lenovo-slips-out-12-5-inch-ideapad-u260-ultraportable-hopes-you/">Engadget</a>: The Lenovo IdeaPad U260 is rumored to be a 12.5-inch notebook PC. That's the first time I've seen this LCD size; it has a "HD-resolution display". That is market-speak for the bare minimum HD pixel format: 1366x768. The LCD comes only in an anti-glare finish, which I would think most folks would want.</p>
<p>The U260 looks classy, is thin (0.71 in), light (3.04 lbs) and packs either an i3 or i5. The plethora of connections (USB, HDMI, Ethernet, VGA) on the right adds to utility but muddies up the beautiful lines.</p>
