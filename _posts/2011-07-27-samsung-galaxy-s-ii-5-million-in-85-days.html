<p><a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/news/presskitRead.do?page=1&amp;news_seq=19895&amp;rdoPeriod=ALL&amp;from_dt=&amp;to_dt=&amp;news_group=ALL&amp;news_type=&amp;news_ctgry=&amp;search_keyword=">Samsung</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The 5 million mark has been reached in just 85 days, a rate which is 40 days faster than the original GALAXY S took to reach the same sales mark. This rate is set to accelerate as Samsung has just launched GALAXY S II in China, the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s largest market.</blockquote><br />
That's a rate of one Galaxy S II sold every 1.5 seconds, which is about the same rate when it hit sales of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/07/04/samsung-galaxy-s-ii-three-million-in-55-days/">three million in 55 days</a>. And it just hit China. The 4.3-inch Super AMOLED Plus-toting Android smartphone will head its way to the U.S. some time in August.</p>
