<p>Here's the list Phil Schiller put up while declaring the iPhone 7's display the best on any smartphone:</p>
<ul>
<li>25% brighter display</li>
<li>Wide color gamut</li>
<li>Cinema standard</li>
<li>Color management</li>
<li>3D Touch</li><br />
</ul><br />
<strong>Brightness</strong>: Let's start from the top. The iPhone 7's display is 25% brighter than the display found in the iPhone 6s. So how bright is it? According to <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/9686/the-apple-iphone-6s-and-iphone-6s-plus-review/13">AnandTech</a>, max brightness in nits:</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhone 6s Plus: 582</li>
<li>iPhone 6s: 567</li><br />
</ul><br />
So, if the iPhone 7's display brightness is 25% brighter:</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhone 7 Plus: 582 + 146 = 728</li>
<li>iPhone 7: 567 + 142 = 709</li><br />
</ul><br />
That's pretty bright. We'll see what AnandTech, DisplayMate and other publications say when they get their hands on the iPhone 7 and measure max brightness.</p>
<p><strong>Wide Color Gamut</strong>: Apple put a "(P3)" after "wide color display" on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone-7/specs/">iPhone 7 specifications page</a>. What's P3? I had to look it up. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCI-P3">Wikipedia</a>, "DCI-P3 or DCI/P3 is a common color space for digital movie projection from the US-American film industry." (DCI stands for Digital Cinema Initiatives, a joint venture composed of&nbsp;major motion picture studios to establish a standard architecture for digital cinema systems.) DCI-P3 covers 85.5% in CIE 1931 or 86.9% in CIE 1976. What does that mean? DCI-P3 covers about the same color space as Adobe RGB, which is wider than Rec. 709. Rec.709 is often associated with sRGB and DCI-P3 covers about 25% more color -- especially with red and green -- than sRGB. The second bullet point -- "Wide color gamut" -- and the third bullet point -- "Cinema standard" -- mean pretty much the same thing: the wide color gamut is the&nbsp;cinema standard DCI-P3. I guess budding filmmakers can use an iPhone 7 and not worry about inaccurate colors.</p>
<p><strong>Color Management</strong>: With the release of iOS 9.3 Apple integrated OS X's&nbsp;ColorSync color management technology into iOS. The first product to make use of ColorSync was the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. ColorSync's job is to make sure colors are accurately reproduced on the iPhone 7.</p>
<p><strong>3D Touch</strong>: Not much needs to be said about 3D Touch, but I don't know of any other smartphone brand that has implemented three dimensional touch on their displays.</p>
<p>So is Phil Schiller right? Is the iPhone 7 display the best? That depends on how we want to define best, but when it comes to a wider color gamut and making sure those colors are color managed for accuracy the iPhone 7 might actually be the best. But that's a fairly narrow definition. I'm going to wait for some benchmark results.</p>
