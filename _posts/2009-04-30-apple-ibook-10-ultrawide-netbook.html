<p>According to <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/09/04/30/apple_to_introduce_more_affordable_macs_sources_say.html">AppleInsider</a> Apple is preparing a netbook. Supposedly Quanta is building a 10" netbook for Apple. But Apple's Tim Cook has said repeatedly that the company is not interested in developing a netbook with features like a cramped keyboard, terrible software, junky hardware and tiny screens. I have some insane ideas about what Apple might be working on.</p>
<p>You can solve the problem of tiny screens and cramped keyboards. If you use a display with a 16:9 or 16:10 ratio the smallest screen you can get down to without having to significantly reduce the size of the keys to make it a cramped keyboard is about 12". But, if you widen the screen a bit, say to 2.3:1, you could make the screen smaller and maintain the size of a keyboard. With a 2.3:1 aspect ratio you could bring the display down to about 10" and keep the keyboard from getting into cramped territory. The Apple iBook, which is what I will call it from now on, will look similar to Sony's VAIO P but will be slightly longer, deeper but much thinner and sexier. The battery will most likely be integrated into the aluminum uni-body like the uni-body 17" MacBook Pro. So going ultrawide will solve the cramped keyboard and tiny screen issues.</p>
<p>The terrible software problem can be easily solved by Apple by putting OS X in it. Simple enough. Will Apple use Intel's Atom? Or an ARM-based CPU? Or a full-blown Intel Core 2 Duo? I'm not sure. I do think there is a chance that Apple might use a processor that is built in-house, something never seen before. The purchase of P.A. Semi (Palo Alto Semiconductor) back in 2008 should bear some fruit by now. The processor will probably be dual-core and should be more powerful than an Atom but consume less energy. One core would be the CPU and the other core could possibly be a graphics processor. This makes sense since Snow Leopard will make good use of both CPU and GPU.</p>
<p>So this is my insane idea about Apple's netbook, the iBook that will be ultrawide and use an in-house processor that will blow the doors off of any netbook out there. Sound crazy? Let me know your thoughts.</p>
