<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://minimalmac.com/post/13462301165/patagonia-the-cleanest-line-dont-buy-this-jacket">Patrick Rhone, Minimal Mac</a>. <a href="http://www.thecleanestline.com/2011/11/dont-buy-this-jacket-black-friday-and-the-new-york-times.html">Patagonia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[...] everyone needs to consume less. Businesses need to make fewer things but of higher quality. Customers need to think twice before they buy.</blockquote></p>
<p>Patagonia addressed the issue of consumerism head on by running an ad in The New York Times on Black Friday telling people, "Don't Buy This Jacket". This company has guts and I like it.</p>
<p>Think twice? Think a dozen times. Take days, weeks, months if necessary. More often than not you end up deciding you really don't need it. But to prevent yourself from starting this mental ping-pong of should-I-buy-it-should-I-not in the first place stay away from TV and magazines, where the supreme purpose of both is to convince you to buy something, anything and everything.</p>
<p>I also wholeheartedly agree that businesses need to focus their attention on making not just fewer things but just a few things with much <em>much</em> higher quality. In the near future I'll be posting up reviews for two cases, one for the iPhone 4 and one for the 17-inch unibody MacBook Pro, with an exhortation toward higher quality.</p>
<p>We can't not buy anything. We need things. But when we do decide to buy things spend the extra time, the extra effort, and the extra money to buy something that is of high quality and that will last for a very long time. The interesting thing is that these high quality products almost never go on sale so there is no rush. You can wait until you are in absolute need.</p>
