<p>Albatron's 22" <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=">multitouch</a> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-monitor">LCD monitor</a> was showcased during Computex 2008 and was working on Windows Vista. The folks over at TGDaily had a blast playing around with Google Earth. According to Robert Doncevski, Sales Director at Albatron, size is not a limit. For instance, the 22" multitouch LCD that was showcased at Computex 2008 has two integrated touch sensors on both sides of the display. Doncevski stated to go <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=24"">24"</a> and larger all you need is to add a third sensor on top of the screen. Sounds pretty simple to me.</p>
<p>Multitouch is great, but I wonder if our fingers will be good enough for high precision work. For instance, drawing precise objects on Illustrator or dot painting on Photoshop can get difficult with a finger. Of course for simple navigation on a page or map, direct input via our fingers is probably the best. As an <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/index.php?s=iphone">iPhone</a> user, I can attest that multitouch LCD and fingers go hand in hand.</p>
