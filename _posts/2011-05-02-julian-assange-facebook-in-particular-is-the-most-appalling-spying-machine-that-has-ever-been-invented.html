<p>Wikileaks founder Julian Assange on <a href="http://thenextweb.com/facebook/2011/05/02/wikileaks-founder-facebook-is-the-most-appalling-spy-machine-that-has-ever-been-invented/">Russia Today (RT)</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Facebook in particular is the most appalling spying machine that has ever been invented. Here we have the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s most comprehensive database about people, their relationships, their names, their addresses, their locations, their communications with each other, their relatives, all sitting within the United States, all accessible to US Intelligence. Facebook, Google, Yahoo, all these major US organizations have built-in interfaces for US Intelligence.</p>
<p>It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not a matter of serving a subpoena, they have an interface they have developed for US Intelligence to use. Now, is it the case that Facebook is actually run by US Intelligence? No, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not like that. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s simply that US Intelligence is able to bring to bear legal and political pressure to them.</p>
<p>And it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s costly for them to hand out records, one by one, so they have automated the process. Everyone should understand that when they add their friends to Facebook they are doing free work for United States intelligence agencies in building this database for them.</blockquote></p>
<p>What do you say to that. Does Assange know something about Facebook's relationship with US intelligence agencies? If this accusation, that the company has developed backdoor access for US intelligence agencies, is true then we have some privacy issues to sort out. I understand that I am giving up a certain level of privacy when I engage the Internet but being actively spied on at will by powerful intelligence agencies that have made their fair share of mistakes is altogether a different matter.</p>
