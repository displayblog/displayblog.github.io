<p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/t-offers-quiet-settlement-iphone-user-193045836.html">Associated Press</a> &rarr; <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-30686_3-57396743-266/at-t-offers-iphone-user-a-settlement-in-throttling-case/?part=rss">Marguerite Reardon, CNET</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Last week AT&T sent a letter to Matthew Spaccarelli, a 39 year-old truck driver from Simi Valley, Calif., who sued AT&T and won his small claims case against the company last month. In the letter, AT&T didn't say whether it would offer him more money. But the company threatened to shut off his service if he didn't sit down and talk with them.</blockquote></p>
<p>Looks like a threat to retaliate on AT&T's part. Drag 'em back to court.</p>
<p><em>Update 2012.03.17:</em> <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/t-scotches-appeal-pays-small-claims-litigant-213224134.html">Peter Svensson, Associated Press</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>AT&T Inc. on Friday gave up on appealing an $850 award won by an iPhone user in small claims court, and sent him a check.</blockquote></p>
<p>I don't expect Spaccarelli will be the last one to receive a US$850 award by suing AT&T.</p>
