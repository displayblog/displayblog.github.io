<p>BCN &rarr; <a href="http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2010/11/04/2010110400482.html?">The Chosunilbo</a>: The fine print is that this is for just one week, just for individual models, and in Japan.</p>
<blockquote><p>According to a ranking by Japanese market researcher BCN, Samsung's flagship smartphone dethroned the 32GB iPhone 4 as the top-selling cell phone for the last week of October, its debut week there.</blockquote></p>
<p>The 16GB iPhone 4 was ranked #3. Combine the two and you get: iPhone 4 > Galaxy S. The big news is that the Samsung Galaxy S broke through the top two models, both iPhone 4s, that have kept the top two spots for 18 weeks in Japan since their release in June.</p>
<p>NTT Docomo, the Japanese carrier that carries both the Galaxy S and the Galaxy Tab had a launch ceremony titled "NTT Docomo + Samsung" back in October. Here's the video of the event:</p>
