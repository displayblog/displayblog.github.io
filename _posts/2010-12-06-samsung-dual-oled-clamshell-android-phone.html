Unfortunately it is limited to the Chinese market. Each Super AMOLED sports 800x480 PenTile Matrix pixels. Other specs include: 5 megapixel camera, 720p HD video capture, 1GHz processor and both CDMA and GSM basebands. The W899 is available on China Telecom. You can see the W899 working in the <a href="http://www.samsung.com/cn/htmlnews/2010/12/player_yvid.swf">launch ceremony video</a>.</p>
