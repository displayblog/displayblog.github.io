<p><a href="http://www.bgr.com/2011/03/31/htc-thunderbolt-outselling-iphone-4-at-verizon-wireless-stores-analyst-claims/">Boy Genius Report</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>BTIG Research analyst Walter Piecyk says HTC&acirc;&euro;&trade;s latest beastly smartphone for Verizon Wireless is going toe to toe with the iPhone 4, and is even outselling Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s iPhone at many Verizon Wireless store locations. Piecyk and his team made calls to 150 different Verizon Wireless stores across 22 major U.S. cities, asking which device was selling better. According to the analyst&acirc;&euro;&trade;s report, 61% of stores said the two devices were selling at about the same rate, 11% said the iPhone 4 was selling faster and 28% said they were selling more ThunderBolt smartphones than iPhones.</blockquote></p>
<p>28% of the 150 Verizon Wireless stores Piecyk called up said the HTC ThunderBolt is selling faster than the iPhone 4. This information is useless. Two critical pieces of information are missing. One, what is the quantity we are talking about? 100 units versus 50, or 80 versus 75? The big Verizon stores might be making up a large portion of the 11% that said iPhone 4 was selling faster. And what about the time frame? That day? The week? Month? Wup-dee-do if this is for just a day. This is research?</p>
