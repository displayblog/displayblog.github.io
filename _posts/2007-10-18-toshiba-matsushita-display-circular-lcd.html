<p><a href="http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20071018/140865/">TechOn</a>: Toshiba Matsushita Display (TMDisplay) has developed a circular LCD. The LCD has an outer diameter of 75mm and a screen size of 62mm (2.44") in diameter and is geared for vehicle instrument panels. The company is stating that the shape is not limited to just circles but can be formed into any shape. The LCD uses a low temperature poly-silicon (LTPS) technology that incorporates electronics right on the glass that allows for the flexibility in shape.</p>
<p>The circular LCD has a pixel format of 240x240 along the longest lines with a brightness of 500 cd/m<sup>2</sup> and a contrast ratio of 600:1. Similar to a notebook PC, the circular LCD is edge-lit by a LED that is mounted on the bottom of the display. The LCD is not too thick at just 11mm. TMD will be showcasing this LCD at FPD International 2007, from Oct 24 at Pacifico Yokohama.</p>
