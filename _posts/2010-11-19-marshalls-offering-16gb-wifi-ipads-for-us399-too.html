<p><a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2010/11/18/t-j-maxx-offering-16-gb-wi-fi-ipads-for-399/">MacRumors</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>T.J. Maxx sister chain Marshalls is apparently also offering the same deal. A MacRumors reader notes that several Marshalls stores in Florida are stocking the entry-level iPad and are reportedly receiving 100 iPads per day over a three-day period.</blockquote></p>
