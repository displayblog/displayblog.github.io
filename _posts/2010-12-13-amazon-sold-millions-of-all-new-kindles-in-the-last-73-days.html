<p>Amazon:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thanks to you, in just the first 73 days of this holiday quarter, we've already sold millions of our all-new Kindles with the latest E Ink Pearl display. In fact, in the last 73 days, readers have purchased more Kindles than we sold during all of 2009. We're grateful for and energized by the overwhelming customer response.</blockquote></p>
<p>In the complex world we live in multi-purpose devices like the iPad will probably win: they help you tackle the millions of things you need to do everyday. But when the world gets too complex and pushes us to focus, a single-purpose device might be the better choice. If we just want to read, the Kindle helps us do that more than the iPad.</p>
<p>With the iPad it is difficult to read outside; the iPad is more of an indoor thing. And even if you're inside the glossy cover glass has a lot of reflections making it difficult to concentrate on reading. The best environment for reading on the iPad is where you have a lot of diffused light (e.g. windows with translucent curtains).</p>
<p>The Kindle doesn't have any of these problems, but you won't be able to read at night with the lights off. I guess you can't have everything. (Actually, you can <em>almost</em> have everything with a Pixel Qi display.)</p>
<p>Looking at Kindle sales a lot of folks seem to want to just read. But, if you want to read just one book, it might be better to get a real book and walk on over to your favorite caf&eacute;.</p>
