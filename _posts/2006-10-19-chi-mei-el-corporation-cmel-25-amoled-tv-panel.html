<p>CMEL used LTPS TFT LCD technology from Chi Mei Optoelectronics (CMO) and its OLED equipment/technology to develop a 25" OLED TV panel. The companies claim that it is the largest LTPS TFT Active Matrix (AM) OLED. CMEL is entering mass production soon.</p>
<p>I doubt it. And if CMEL is bringing a 25" AMOLED LCD TV panel to market, it will cost you maybe $3000. Maybe a whole lot more. No thanks. I'll take my Sony 60" SXRD for just a little more.</p>
