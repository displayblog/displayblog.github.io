<blockquote><p>"During our initial meeting with Malcolm, he referred to the three books as 'intellectual adventure stories,'" Sahre tells Co.Design. "Brian and I really responded to that, as it suggested a specific and interesting way to think about how the books could be designed. We wanted the books to feel like first editions of <em>Moby-Dick</em> or <em>Treasure Island</em> or <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>."</blockquote></p>
<p>Exquisite.</p>
