<p><a href="http://www.asymco.com/2012/08/15/american-exceptionalism/">Horace Dediu</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The share of iPhone thus defined shows a slight decline but it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s an overall number that is remarkably resilient as distribution increases and is remarkably high overall. Note that globally, the iPhone gets only about 17% share of smartphones&acirc;&euro;&ldquo;a value that has not varied greatly since mid 2009.</blockquote></p>
<p>In the U.S. the iPhone's share ranges from over 2x to slightly less than 4x its global share.</p>
