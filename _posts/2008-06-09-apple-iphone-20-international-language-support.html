<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/06/09/steve-jobs-keynote-live-from-wwdc-2008/">Engadget</a>: <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=apple">Apple</a> has announced that the iPhone 2.0 OS will support many languages including Japanese and Chinese with character drawing and recognition. I hope they didn't forget Korean. :-)</p>
<p>This is fantastic! With a physical QWERTY keyboard, this is almost impossible to do. I can't wait to send an email in Korean to my folks in Seoul!</p>
