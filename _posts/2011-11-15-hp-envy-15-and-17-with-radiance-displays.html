<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/16/2564695/hp-envy-15-and-17-new-designs-and-radiance-displays-start-at-1100-on">Joanna Stern, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Just as before, the line comes in 15.6- and 17.3-inch variants, but these aren't just normal LCD screens: the very bright Radiance Infinity displays are making a big comeback and are now standard across the lineup. Unfortunately, the base model is saddled with a 1366 x 768 resolution, but you can upgrade to a 1920 x 1080 panel. And even better the 17.3-inch model comes with that full HD display standard.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2009/09/30/hp-radiance-display/">Radiance Displays</a>-branded LCDs in HP notebooks have been highly praised in the past for their vivid colors and crisp resolution. I hope the new ones in the Envy 15 and 17 are just as good.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/1/4/2677801/hp-envy-15-review-late-2011">Sean Hollister, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We were originally told that the HP Envy 14's luscious Radiance Display would come standard on the new Envy, but I'm sorry to say that's not the case: the stock $1,100 Envy 15 comes with a 1366 x 768 "HP BrightView" screen, or you can pay an additional $150 for the 1920 x 1080 Radiance option. Our review unit came with the Radiance, so I can't tell you how well the BrightView performs, but let's face facts: if you can't afford $1,249 for the real deal, you're missing out. This bright, crisp, clear 1080p screen is one of the prime reasons to buy an Envy, and it's a clear advantage over the 15-inch MacBook Pro, too, which tops out at just 1680 x 1050 resolution. Besides, trust me, 1366 x 768 just doesn't cut it on a 15-inch screen.</blockquote></p>
<p>A 1920x1080 pixel format on a 15.x-inch display. <em>Sounds</em> good, but the reality is the fonts and icons are too small for most folks. Yes, you can adjust 'DPI' settings on Windows, but not all parts of the UI plays nice and you end up with an uglier version of Windows. The one very good thing about 1920x1080 is watching 1080p HD video. Unfortunately the HP Envy 15 doesn't have a Blu-ray option, but watching ripped Blu-ray movies on the road would probably be fantastic.</p>
<p><em>Update 2:</em> The Radiance Display has problems showing red, displays orange instead. More info at <a href="http://forum.notebookreview.com/hp-envy-hdx/636482-envy-15-ips-red-vs-orange-tally.html">Notebook Review's forum</a>.</p>
