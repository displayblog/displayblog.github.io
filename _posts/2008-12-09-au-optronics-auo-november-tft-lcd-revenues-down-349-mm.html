<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=au-optronics">AU Optronics</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=auo">AUO</a>), the largest LCD supplier in Taiwan, reported November TFT LCD results for November on December 8, 2008. Preliminary consolidated revenues declined 34.9% M/M and 66.8% Y/Y to NT$17,754 million. Large-sized (10" and larger) LCD shipments were down 29.2% M/M to just over 4.5 million units. Small/medium LCD shipments fared worse dropping 34.5% M/M to 14.85 million units. AUO is revising its Q4'08 guidance that it originally gave on October 23, 2008. The company is expecting high-20% Q/Q declines for large-sized LCD shipments in Q4'08. Small/medium panel shipments are forecasted to drop 25% Q/Q. Overall LCD fab utilization rates are expected to be around 60%. Normal rates hover around 90% so AUO is certainly feeling the decline of end user demand for LCD goods.</p>
