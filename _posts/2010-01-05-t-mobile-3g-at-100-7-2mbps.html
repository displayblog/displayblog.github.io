<p><a href="http://www.phonescoop.com/news/item.php?n=5310">Phone Scoop</a> via <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/05/t-mobile-takes-entire-3g-network-to-7-2mbps/">Engadget</a>: T-Mobile announced today that its entire 3G network has been upgraded from 3.6Mbps to 7.2Mbps. The company is also planning to be the first to deploy HSPA+ by mid-2010. With HSPA+ we're looking at download speeds of 21Mbps! Couple this announcement with the Nexus One and the fact that the superphone will be coming to Verizon, which has the largest 3G coverage, and I get the feeling that there is something big going on. The only thing left to do is announce that Nexus One will be coming to Sprint making use of its 4G network to squeeze AT&amp;T and the iPhone as tight as possible.</p>
