<p>This 19" LCD monitor has a 2000:1 CR, the highest I&#39;ve ever heard on a LCD monitor. There are three ways to improve CR. One is to keep the black levels the same and increase the brightness. The second way is to keep the brightness the same and decrease the black levels. The final way is to increase the brightness and decrease the black levels. TFT LCD technology has been battling light leakage for many years, where light leaks through a black screen due to its inherent design. I am not sure how Samsung achieved this impressive CR, but it must be a dynamic contrast management system that looks at the overall brightness of the image and modulates the brightness of the CCFLs.</p>
