<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/03/hands-on-with-apples-thinner-faster-ipad-2/?pid=1555&viewall=true">Brian Chen</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The iPad 2 weighs 1.3 pounds, just 0.2 pounds lighter than the previous iPad. Held in the hands, this minor weight change will make a significant difference, especially when you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re reading books or watching video for long periods of time. It felt much easier on the wrists.</blockquote></p>
<p>Combine the slightly lighter with the dramatically thinner and <em>presto!</em> you get something different. Significantly different.</p>
