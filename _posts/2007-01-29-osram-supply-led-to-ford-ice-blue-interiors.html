<p><a href="http://ledsmagazine.com/articles/news/4/1/29?alert=1">LEDs Magazine</a>: Osram Opto Semiconductor has been contracted by Ford Motor Company to provide LED lighting solutions. Osram's LED lighting will be used as the light source for Ford's newly upgraded "Ice Blue" interiors. The Ice Blue interiors feature a consistent color for instrumentation, radios, climate control and switches. Ford's 2008 Ford Focus and the 2008 Ford Escape will feature Ice Blue interiors.</p>
<p>A unified interior lighting scheme is a much needed feature for most American cars. European automobiles from the likes of BMW, Mercedes Benz, Audi and even VWs have had consistent interior lighting. It is about time American cars feature lighting that is consistent throughout.</p>
