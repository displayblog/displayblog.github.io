<p><a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/sarah_rotman_epps/11-03-10-why_ipad_2_wont_have_much_competition_in_2011_unless_its_from_amazon">Forrester</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Competing tablets to the iPad are poised to fail, which is why we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re forecasting that Apple will have at least 80% share of the US consumer tablet market in 2011.</blockquote></p>
<p>One key point: the human factor at Apple Stores makes a big difference. Enter any Apple Store and you'll see a bunch of people playing with iPads, MacBooks, iPhones, etc. Got a question? An Apple employee or two is nearby. Enter any Verizon store and you'll see a bunch of people waiting too long for someone to take care of their problems. Same goes for AT&T. Where do you go to play with and buy a Motorola Xoom? Not somewhere I'd want to go.</p>
