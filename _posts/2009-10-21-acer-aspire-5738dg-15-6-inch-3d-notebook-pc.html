<strong>Average</strong> You'll need to wear the included 3D glasses. PC Magazine took it for a spin and found the 3D effects cool but gaming and video converted to 3D were not as cool. For consumers, I would think that those two things (watching movies and playing games) are the two most important activities that can be enhanced by 3D. I think we have a ways to go to perfect 3D on our computers.</p>
<p>I've tested a few 3D displays and after a while I do end up getting a headache and my eyes are pleading me to look somewhere else. The 5738DG without the 3D glasses didn't create any negative effects according to PC Magazine.</p>
