<p><a href="http://www.oled-info.com/another-oled-video-philips-oled-wall">OLED-Info</a> has gotten a video of the Philips Lumiblade transparent OLED wall in action. The OLED wall reacts to objects in front of it and has a retro feel but is definitely very high tech. The OLED wall is both a lighting fixture as well as a type of display and that makes it very interesting. Now how about a massive multitouch OLED display?</p>
