<p><a href="http://www.worldwarhack.com/about/">Wyatt Dyer</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Once Viper Comics caught wind of how I got pulled into a government hacking conspiracy during my senior year in high school, they relentlessly pestered me to work with their team and tell my tale as a graphic novel and finally, I agreed.</blockquote></p>
<p>Eighteen-year-old Wyatt Dyer is part of a group of elite hackers, who have been invited to participate in a hacking competition&mdash;the U.S. government's last effort to solve an international crisis. The artwork is simple, direct, and bold. I haven't read a comic book in a long time partly because the "graphic novel" genre has become too graphic for me, but I enjoyed WORLD WAR///hack; it was a right combination of action, suspense, and hacking geekery.</p>
