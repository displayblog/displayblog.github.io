<p>CEDIA is the place to have been last week. LG Electronics (LGE) showed off its new 47LB1DA, a 47&acirc;&euro;&sup3; LCD TV with Full HD resolutions of 1920 x 1080. It has two HDMI ports. MSRP is at a cool $3,999. There is <a href="http://displayblog.com/?p=340">a previous blog entry</a> regarding the 47LB1DA in detail but the picture is new. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m not digging the whimpy-looking stand though&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;</p>

<p>With some concern over large TVs tipping over, I would like to see CE companies come out with stand designs that are not only functional and sexy, but also sturdy/solid.</p>
