<p><a href="http://micro.newswire.ca/release.cgi?rkey=1607093105&view=5804-0&Start=0">Micro Newswire</a>: Rogers, the Canadian carrier that will be offering Apple's iPhone 3G, has launched a promotional offer of 6GB for $30 per month for the data portion of the iPhone 3G. Engadget says that it is "not quite unlimited data, but close enough". But we need to realize that AT&T's definition of unlimited data is not quite unlimited.</p>
<p>As far as I know, AT&T (and others) have its own definition of unlimited: 5GB per month. So Rogers is upping the game. But here's the catch: Canadians will require a THREE year contract and do it before August 31. There will be a July 11 launch at 8am at six Rogers Plus stores in major Canadian cities. And get this: you folks get free breakfast too. Before this change of heart, Rogers was charging an arm and a leg.</p>
