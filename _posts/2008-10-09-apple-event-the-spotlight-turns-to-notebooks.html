  2008.10.13 8:05PM PST</strong> Somebody snuck in a real picture it seems. Of
  the new MacBook Pro, of course! It looks like the 15.4\" version. There seems to
  be a plastic/glass cover over the LCD. The cover design looks very similar to
  what we see in current iMacs. Some won't like it because of the glare. The keyboard
  is of the MacBook Air variety, which I personally think is a good thing. The trackpad
  is just a trackpad: no LCDs. This time.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img

  has a post up referring to bbGadgets' calculation</a> that if the Apple logo
  on the picture is the standard 1.5\" size, the notebook PC has a diagonal length
  of 13.3\". Now, I'm not one to argue mathematics but if in fact the diagonal length
  of the notebook PC is 13.3\", I will indeed argue that the LCD inside will be slightly
  smaller at around 12\". So, if the case really is 13.3\" diagonally, we're looking
  at Apple to showcase an even smaller 12\" aluminum MacBook and <a href=\"http://blogs.zdnet.com/hardware/?p=2698&amp;tag=nl.e589\">for

<p>There has been two pictures floating around the Internet of the new notebook PCs from Apple. One picture (above), if true, shows off a MacBook Air-like keyboard structure where the keys pop through the aluminum enclosure. Another picture (below) showing the port side of the top enclosure seems to suggest that that it might not be a single piece of aluminum.</p>
