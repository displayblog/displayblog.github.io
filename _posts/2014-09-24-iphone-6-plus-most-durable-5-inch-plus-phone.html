<p>Nathan Olivarez-Giles, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/personal-technology/2014/09/22/iphone-6-is-the-most-durable-iphone-yet-says-insurer/">The Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Having put the new iPhones through its gauntlet of durability tests this weekend, SquareTrade found that the iPhone 6 holds up impressively well in drops, spills and slips &mdash; despite the fact that the new, thinner iPhones are tougher to hold onto given their smooth edges and bigger screens.</p>
<p>The iPhone 6 Plus fared well, too, managing to beat out Samsung&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Galaxy S5 as &acirc;&euro;&oelig;the most durable phone with a screen larger than five inches.&acirc;&euro; This comes as a surprise, and not only because the Galaxy S5 is <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304819004579487392797543028">known for its waterproofing</a>, but also because hundreds have already <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=iphone%20slippery&src=typd">taken to</a> Twitter to gripe that an iPhone 6 purchase means a case purchase, too.</blockquote></p>
<p>If I were to purchase an iPhone 6 or a 6 Plus I would definitely get a case. For two reasons: one is the ugly toyish-looking antenna bands, and the other is for insurance, just in case I have it in my pants and sit on it. It would not be a leather case or a thin plastic case; it would be one of those foam-polycarbonate-metal-constructed rugged cases. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/09/23/get-bent">John Gruber</a> on the iPhone 6 Plus getting bent:</p>
<blockquote><p>I cannot believe that this &acirc;&euro;&oelig;bent iPhone 6 Plus&acirc;&euro; thing is becoming a thing. [...] If you feel pressure like this on your iPhone 6 in your pocket, you need looser pants. And if you put your phone in your back pocket and sit on it, I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m not sure what to tell you.</blockquote></p>
<p>I think it unreasonable to assume no one will ever sit down with an iPhone 6 Plus in her front or back pocket. We all make mistakes, but this kind of &acirc;&euro;&tilde;mistake&acirc;&euro;&trade; should not lead to a bent phone. You are wearing the wrong type of pants? I think the more accurate assessment would be: Apple needs to make the iPhone 6 Plus more resilient to being bent inside pockets.</p>
<p>In the meantime perhaps the <a href="http://amzn.to/1u0AUR9">UnderTech Undercover Woman&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Concealment Short Shorts</a> (takes you to Amazon.com) can be modified to carry an iPhone 6 Plus.</p>
