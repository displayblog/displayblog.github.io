<p><a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120208/sprint-sells-1-8-million-iphones-in-first-quarter-with-40-percent-going-to-new-customers/">Ina Fried</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://investors.sprint.com/Cache/1001163634.PDF?D=&O=PDF&IID=4057219&Y=&T=&FID=1001163634">Sprint's Q4'11 results press release</a>. I think Sprint will do well. Cloud-based services like Siri will require lots of data and I see Sprint's unlimited data plan as the only viable option if you want to take full advantage of the iPhone's capabilities.</p>
