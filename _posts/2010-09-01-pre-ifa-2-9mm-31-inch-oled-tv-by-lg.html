<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/01/lg-teases-worlds-thinnest-2-9mm-oled-television-other-goodie/">Engadget</a> strolled through LG's yet-to-be-fully-constructed booth at IFA and found that the electronics giant will be showcasing the world's thinnest (2.9 mm) OLED TV and it's 31 inches. Coming to a store near you? Probably not any time soon.</p>
