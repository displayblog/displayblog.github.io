<p><a href="http://www.asymco.com/2011/07/29/apple-captured-two-thirds-of-available-mobile-phone-profits-in-q2">Horace Dediu</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This quarter saw a slight sequential decline in overall profit for the sector, but four vendors did not manage a profit from selling phones. Nokia, Motorola, Sony-Ericsson and LG all saw losses. The other vendors split the slightly decreased pie with Apple getting two thirds of it (66.3%)</blockquote></p>
<p>Samsung captured 15%, RIM 11%, and HTC 7%.</p>
