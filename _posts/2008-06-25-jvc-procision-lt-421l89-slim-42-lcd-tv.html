<p>On June 17, 2008, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=jvc">JVC</a> announced the world's thinnest <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a>s with built-in tuners: its <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=42"">42"</a> LT-421L89 and its 46" LT-46SL89. Both weigh less and consume less power compared to other average LCD TVs. The bezel lost some thickness too. How did JVC do it? </p>
<p>They slimmed down the backlight unit (BLU) and the power supply substrate. The BLU is 40% smaller in depth measuring just 20mm (0.79") deep and 13mm (0.51") wide. The light-diffusing plates and light-reflection sheets were optimized leading to a new and slim BLU that has light uniformity at all four corners. This was done without adding additional CCFL tubes. </p>
<p>The power-supply substrate is in a direct-mount configuration and uses a fan-less heat dissipation system to reduce not only power consumption but noise as well. The LT-421L89 sips power: 145W, which is about half of typical LCD TVs this size. Weight has been reduced to just 12kg (26.4lbs).</p>
