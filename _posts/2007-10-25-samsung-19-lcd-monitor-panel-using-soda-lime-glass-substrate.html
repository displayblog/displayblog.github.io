<p class="P1">Instead of using the typical TFT <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-glass">LCD glass</a> substrate, <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=samsung">Samsung</a> Electronics displayed a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=19"">19"</a> <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=lcd-monitor">LCD monitor</a> panel using a soda-lime glass substrate at the FPD International 2007 conference in Yokohama, Japan. The LCD monitor features a pixel format of <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1280-x-1024">1280 x 1024</a>. Normal TFT LCD glass substrates are sodium- and alkali-free. Soda-lime glass is not as transparent as regular TFT LCD glass substrates and may need a more powerful backlight or a more efficient optical film stack to compensate. In addition, soda-lime glass is difficult to make thin. Current TFT LCD glass substrates are just 0.5mm to 0.7mm thick. Although there is potential for a reduction of material cost going from normal LCD glass to soda-lime glass, there will be some difficulties to overcome. But Samsung seems to have everything under control at its G5 plant with the 19" LCD monitor panel featuring a brightness of 300 cd/m2, a contrast ratio of 1000:1 and a color gamut of 72% NTSC. Samsung stated that volume production is imminent. I am not sure who supplies soda-lime glass, but this news might impact Corning. Corning is one of the largest suppliers of LCD glass.</p></p>
