<p>If you absolutely must have dual 17.3-inch displays on your notebook, the Spacebook from GScreen is it. It looks thick, mighty ugly, but it is capable: 2.66GHz Core i7-620M CPU, 4GB DDR3 RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTS 150M GPU with 1GB, Windows 7 Pro. You will certainly be paying for all those pixels: US$2895 in May via online retailers like Amazon.
