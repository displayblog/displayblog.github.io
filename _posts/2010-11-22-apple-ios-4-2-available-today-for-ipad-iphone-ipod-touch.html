<blockquote><p>iOS 4.2 makes the iPad a completely new product, just in time for the holiday season. Once again, the iPad with iOS 4.2 will define the target that other tablets will aspire to, but very few, if any, will ever be able to hit.</blockquote></p>
<p>With AirPlay you can stream music, video, and photos from an iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch to an Apple TV. If you have one of these fine HP printers (Photosmart, LaserJet Pro, Officejet) you can start printing wirelessly right away using AirPrint.</p>
<p>Find My iPhone works with iPhone 4, iPod touch (4th generation) and iPad. It is free as long as you're a MobileMe subscriber.</p>
<p>If you have an iPad, you've been waiting a long time for this. I've checked for the 4.2 update but iTunes says iOS 4.1 is still the latest for my iPhone 4. I guess I'll be checking again later today.</p>
