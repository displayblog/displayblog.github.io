<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/05/asus-rog-g73jh-launches-with-core-i7-radeon-hd-5870-bragging-r/">Engadget</a>: The ROG G73jh is a powerful gaming notebook sporting a huge 17.3-inch LCD with a 1920 x 1080 pixel format. GPU power comes from ATI's Radeon HD 5870 and CPU power is driven by Intel's Core i7-720QM coupled with 8GB DDR3 RAM. Other specs include: Blu-ray/DVD combo drive, 8-channel HD audio, up to 1TB HDD, 2MP webcam, WiFi BG (no N?!?), Gigabit Ethernet, Bluetooth 2.1, 8-in-1 memory card reader, 8-cell battery, mini-VGA, and Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>If there is a purpose for angles in product design, I'm all for that. Non-purposeful angles just for the sake of angles? Nah. Unfortunately the ROG G73jh has a lot of angles just for the sake of having angles. I guess ASUS was thinking Lamborghini. And wouldn't you want more pixels than less, especially when you're playing games? I do. Give me the extra 120 vertical pixels and make it 1920 x 1200. And besides, most Blu-ray titles are much wider than 16:9 so you'll end up with black bars anyway. Besides the two misgivings the ROG G73jh should be great for gaming. Price? Yet unknown.</p>
