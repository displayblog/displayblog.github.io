<p>On May 10, 2010 Chimei Innolux announced April 2010 results with revenues increasing 30% M/M and 287% Y/Y to NT$49.9B. Large-sized unit shipments increased 17% M/M and 246% Y/Y to 11.4M while small-medium units increased 49% M/M and 493% Y/Y to 37.7M. Unit shipments are not a very accurate measure of performance; neither are revenues. I would like to see companies focus on display area shipments and net profits per display area shipped. Nevertheless CMI seems to have had a very strong month in April.</p>
