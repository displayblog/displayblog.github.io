<p><a href="http://www.sony.co.jp/SonyInfo/News/Press/201104/11-051/">Sony Japan</a>: Sony announced two Trimaster EL professional OLED monitors. The 24.5-inch PVM-2541 and the 16.5-inch PVM-1741. Both OLED monitors pack a 10-bit 1920x1080 panel with RGB sub-pixel structures.</p>
<p>Sony uses its Super Top Emission (STE) structure that causes the emitted light to travel toward the front of the OLED display, a more efficient method compared to bottom emission that leads to lower power consumption and longer lifetimes. Viewing angles are excellent at 178/178.</p>
<p>The 24.5-inch PVM-2541 is priced at &yen;627,900 (about US$7500) and the 16.5-inch PVM-1741 at &yen;417,900 (about $5000). Availability is slated for the second half of 2011.</p>
