<blockquote><p>Apple sells 1.5 million iPads every 2 weeks, for context.</blockquote></p>
<p>Motorola Mobility, Chairman and CEO, <a href="http://mediacenter.motorola.com/Press-Releases/Motorola-Mobility-Announces-Second-Quarter-Financial-Results-3770.aspx">Sanjay Jha</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>With a focus on profitable growth and delivering differentiated LTE smartphones and tablets, we expect to achieve profitability in Mobile Devices in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2011.</blockquote></p>
<p>Maybe that's the difference. Apple focuses on building the best products possible for its customers. Motorola focuses on growth, differentiation, and profitability.</p>
