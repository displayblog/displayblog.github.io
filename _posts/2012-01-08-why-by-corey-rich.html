<p>Nikon D4: 720/60p, H.264 at 10mbps. This is why you want an awesome display. </p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Before, Vimeo embeds didn't always work, so I vowed not to embed anymore. Today is the first embed <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/06/09/digital-signage-japan-2011-scala-transparent-touch-display/">since June 2011</a>. Vimeo has an HTML5 player and the video above is an HTML5 embed, so I'm hoping this will work reliably, especially for non-Flash devices like iPads and iPhones.</p>
