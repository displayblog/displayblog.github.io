  the LCD was intact and the iPhone was still functioning. At the time broken iPhones

  I thought of the Apple Store and thought maybe I could get lucky. I had heard of
  wonderful stories online and from friends who experienced Nordstrom-like service

  looked at my iPhone and gave me the price: $200, for Apple to fix it. That was a
  bit too expensive for me. "

<p>A while ago my <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/search-results/?cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3A8h7p9w-uqw7&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=iphone&amp;sa=Search#1348">iPhone</a> slid out my hands and did a face-plant on concrete, cracking the front cover.

<p>But I remembered iFixit (<a href="http://www.ifixit.com/">www.ifixit.com</a>), a company that sells pretty much anything you need to fix stuff, stuff like iPhones. Kyle Wiens, CEO of iFixit, was kind enough to send me an "<a href="http://www.ifixit.com/iPhone-Parts">iPhone 3G Front Panel Kit</a>" so I could fix my broken iPhone. The process took quite some time, a lot more effort, a blow dryer, and a high level of dexterity but at the end of a couple of hours, my iPhone 3G was back in shape and 100% operational. If your iPhone had the misfortune to slide through your hands and do a face plant on concrete, the "iPhone 3G Front Panel Kit" from iFixit is absolutely the way to go. There is a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsFTlVTSeIA">YouTube video showing you how it is done</a>.</p>
