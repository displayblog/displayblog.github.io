<p>It took Dyson seven years and US$42 million to develop version 4.0 of the Dyson digital motor. Kyle VanHemert, <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1671939/dysons-80-million-new-factory-dedicated-to-its-most-unsung-invention#1">Co.Design</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s one of the smallest, quietest high-powered motors in the world, accelerating from zero to 92,000 rpm in less than 0.7 seconds, thanks to its super-efficient electromagnet-based design.</blockquote></p>
<p>Fifty five robots will manufacture 4 million digital motors per year at the Dyson West Park factory in Singapore.</p>
