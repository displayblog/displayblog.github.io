<p>Chunghwa Picture Tubes (CPT) is using Clairvoyante's PenTile RGBW in its 4.0" and 7.0" WVGA LCDs with 800 x 480 resolution that were showcased at FPD International in Yokohama, Japan. Because of the squared shape of the pixels and the addition of a white sub-pixel, Clairvoyante's PenTile RGBW technology increases the relative resolution and brightness compared to traditional RGB-stripe designs. Before, CPT used Clairvoyante's technology to manufacture 2.0" and 2.2" QVGA (240 x 320) mobile display prototypes. An additional benefit of Clairvoyante's PenTile RGBW technology is the reduction in required driver ICs that lead to lower power consumption, which has been the focus of research and development for mobile devices where customers look for long-lasting devices.</p>
