<blockquote><p>Our sources are saying that not only will there be a newly designed iPhone coming in the fall, but there is going to be a new entry into the iPad family as well. As hard as it might be to believe, the new tablet is said to sport a double resolution screen (2048 x 1536), and will be dubbed the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;iPad HD.&acirc;&euro; The idea behind the product is apparently that it will be a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;pro&acirc;&euro; device aimed at a higher end market &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; folks who work in video and photo production possibly &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; and will be introduced alongside something like an iPad version of Final Cut or Aperture. This product is specifically said to not be the iPad 3, rather a complimentary piece of the iPad 2 line. Think MacBook and MacBook Pro.</blockquote></p>
<p>What is HD about 2048x1536? Sure, you could playback 1920x1080 video from the 9.7-inch Retina Display, but to put HD as a suffix inadvertently highlights and diminishes the iPad. The iPad is great for a lot of things. But by leaning toward its video playback capabilities, because that's essentially what you're doing when you slap HD at the end of iPad, Apple would be making the iPad out to some video playback device. It certainly is, but the iPad is much more than that. I don't think Apple would call a Pro-level iPad an iPad HD. Instead, I think it'll be called <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/07/06/why-the-higher-end-ipad-model-will-be-called-ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>.</p>
