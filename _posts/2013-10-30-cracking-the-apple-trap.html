<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/magazine/why-apple-wants-to-bust-your-iphone.html">Catherine Rampell, The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>At first, I thought it was my imagination. Around the time the iPhone 5S and 5C were released, in September, I noticed that my sad old iPhone 4 was becoming a lot more sluggish. The battery was starting to run down much faster, too. But the same thing seemed to be happening to a lot of people who, like me, swear by their Apple products. When I called tech analysts, they said that the new operating system (iOS 7) being pushed out to existing users was making older models unbearably slow. Apple phone batteries, which have a finite number of charges in them to begin with, were drained by the new software.</blockquote></p>
<p>The iPhone 4 is about three years old. Assuming the battery was cycled 300 times&mdash;once every three days&mdash;the iPhone 4 hit its expected lifetime. iOS 7 didn't drain the battery, three years of use did. I happen to have my iPhone 4 and I haven't seen any adverse effects of upgrading to iOS 7. It's been a while since I've used it on a regular basis, so my observations might not be as objective as it could be, but my iPhone 4 feels new again. That's just me. (My iPhone 3G and my original iPhone are still alive too, and it would be really cool to see iOS 7 work one those!) The fact of the matter is your iPhone's battery will eventually go kaput. And that goes for any battery in any smartphone. Replacing the battery for the iPhone 4 and 4S is fairly easy, and <a href="http://www.ifixit.com/iPhone-Parts/iPhone-4-Replacement-Battery/IF182-000">it's cheap</a>.
