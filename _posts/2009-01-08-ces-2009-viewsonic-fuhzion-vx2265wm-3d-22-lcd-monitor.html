<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=viewsonic">ViewSonic</a> introduced its FuHzion <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=3d">3D</a> displays at CES 2009 and the FuHzion VX2265wm is the regular VX2265wm that has been 3D enabled. ViewSonic claims the FuHzion VX2265wm is the "ultimate gaming monitor" and has some features to back it up: it is one of the few LCD monitors that support a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=120hz">120Hz</a> frequency so you don't get the jaggies while either playing games or watching HD video. Another feature that will help when trying to frag your opponent will be the the super-fast 3ms response time. But the defining feature of the FuHzion VX2265wm is that it is ready for 3D stereoscopic gaming. In order to game in 3D you'll need a NVIDIA GeForce 3D Vision kit and one of the following GPUs: GeForce 8800 GT or higher, 9600 GT or higher, all GTX 200 series and Windows Vista 32-bit or 64-bit. I am not sure if you can experience 3D with an ATI solution. Let me know if you find out.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the FuHzion VX2265wm falls short of being the ultimate gaming LCD monitor: the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1680-x-1050">1680 x 1050</a> pixel format; gotta have <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1920-x-1080">1920 x 1080</a>. Also, support for ATI GPUs should be there as well.</p>
