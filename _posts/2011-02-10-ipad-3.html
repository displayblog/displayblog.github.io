<blockquote><p>I am nearly dead certain the iPad 2 is going to have the same display resolution and size as the current iPad. I am not so sure at all, though, that there won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be a double-resolution 2048&acirc;&euro;&permil;&Atilde;&mdash;&acirc;&euro;&permil;1536 iPad in 2011.</blockquote></p>
<p>My postulation in <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/01/23/ipad-retina-display/"><em>iPad & Retina Display</em></a> back on January 23rd:</p>
<blockquote><p>I expect to see an iPad with a Retina Display announcement in 2011.</blockquote></p>
<p>Whether that iPad will be called iPad 3 I have no idea, but I'm betting that we'll get to see it announced before 2011 is over.</p>
