<p>Dana Wollman, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/08/04/lenovo-ideapad-k1-review/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The 10.1-inch (1280 x 800) display has viewing angles comparable to other tablets we've seen, which is to say you can get away with watching a movie from the side or with the tab face-up on a table, but the glare from the screen might make it a not-so-pleasant experience. And while the resolution is on par with pretty much any other 10-inch slate, the panel doesn't seem quite as bright as some others. The Galaxy Tab 10.1's screen, for instance, has the same size and resolution screen, but it's noticeably more vibrant. The K1's looks murky by comparison.</blockquote></p>
<p>Vibrant could mean over-saturated, inaccurate colors. Murky could mean adequately saturated, more accurate colors.</p>
<p>I'm still waiting for what I think a lot of folks are waiting for: a tablet with an anti-glare, anti-reflective, and anti-refractive (optically laminated) display.</p>
