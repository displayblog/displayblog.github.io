<p>Laptop gave SanDisk's Sansa Connect MP3 player a rating of 3.5 of 5 stars. The Sansa Connect is SanDisk's first foray into MP3 players with WiFi. By working with Yahoo and Zing, SanDisk via the Yahoo Music Unlimited To Go allows you to tap into a much larger library of music compared to Archos or Microsoft. The WiFi range was just adequate while Laptop gave good marks for its audio quality. Firmware can be upgraded over the air via WiFi, which is a very convenient feature.</p>
