<p><a href="http://www.digitalpictureframereview.com/parrot-digital-photo-frame-by-andree-putman-announced">Digital PictureFrame Review</a> &rarr; <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/07/16/parrot-offers-up-450-andree-putman-designed-digiframe/">Engadget</a>: <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=parrot">Parrot</a> has introduced an interesting product, a product that brings back a bit of flare into a product category that is  increasingly commoditized and rather bland. The design is unique and the name can take this otherwise regular <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=digital-photo-frame">digital photo frame</a> into the homes of the wealthy. The one feature that is unique about Parrot's <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=andree-putman">Andree Putman</a> designed photo frame is that it automatically rotates based on whether it is in landscape or portrait mode, a feature inspired by the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=iphone">iPhone</a>, I'm sure.</p>
<p>To advance in terms of design requires not only design, but usability and a high-tech pedigree. The 7" display with a paltry <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=720-x-480">720 x 480</a> pixel format is quite low-end. There is no wireless connectivity and the memory card slot takes just SD and MMC. There are no touch capabilities either. I am not sure what external materials are used, but may I suggest brushed aluminum, magnesium alloy, real wood, etc.? For $450, you can have a rather unique device in that it is designed by Andree Putman, but other than the external design, there isn't much you're paying for.</p>
