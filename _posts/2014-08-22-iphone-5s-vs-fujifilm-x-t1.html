<blockquote><p>But when the sun goes down, or when I need more creative control, or when I just want the more intimate experience of turning an aperture dial while looking through a viewfinder, the iPhone's going to stay in my pocket and the X-T1 will be hanging from my neck.</blockquote></p>
<p>I don't need more creative control or a more intimate experience; what I want and need is an iPhone-like experience (point and shoot, small and portable) that produces better photos than an iPhone.</p>
<p>That's why when I found a great deal on a Sony RX100 on Craigslist a few of months ago I jumped on it. Small? Check. Portable? Check. Point and shoot? Check. Better photos than an iPhone? You bet.</p>
