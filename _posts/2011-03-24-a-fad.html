<blockquote><p>Yet strong sales are backing up the hype--at least for now--suggesting something about the devices has caught on with consumers.</p>
<p>What is that mysterious "something"? Purely marketing, I believe. Apple is nothing if not master of the glitzy sales pitch, and there's never been better proof of that than the iPad's current success.</p>
<p>Mark my words: The device--and all the others of its ilk that have sprung up for a piece of the action--are nothing more than a passing fad, at least in the mainstream.</blockquote></p>
