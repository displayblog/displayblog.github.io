<blockquote><p>The display industry is racing to launch more 4K&Atilde;&mdash;2K screen sizes and to mobilize production in larger volumes, with even OLED 4Kx2K sets being demonstrated. Sony, LG, Samsung, and Sharp are all moving forward with this technology, along with other Japanese brands, the six leading Chinese brands, and value-oriented brands such as Vizio and Funai. In addition to vertical integration by the major players, merchant panel suppliers such as AUO and Innolux are working with several manufacturers on 4K&Atilde;&mdash;2K. Initial efforts in test broadcasting and standardization are also underway.</blockquote></p>
