<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=chi-mei-optoelectronics">Chi Mei Optoelectronics</a> (<a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=cmo">CMO</a>) is the number two LCD supplier in Taiwan. On December 8, 2008, CMO reported November TFT LCD sales and it was not good. Net sales dropped 41.3% M/M and 65.9% Y/Y to NT$12,234 million. Large-sized (10" or larger) LCD shipments declined 31.6% M/M and 35% Y/Y to 3,361K units. The worst part was small/medium sized LCD shipments: dropped 60.5% M/M to 5,053K units. CMO cited weak demand in the end-market and expects Q4'08 results to be pretty poor: 35% Q/Q drop in LCD shipments for TV applications and 40% Q/Q drop in LCD shipments for IT applications (notebook PCs, LCD monitors, digital signage, etc.). These results are not surprising considering that end user demand for LCD goods have been dropping like a rock the world over. There should be some positive news coming out soon regarding strong FPD (Flat Panel Display) TV sales during Black Friday. I hope.</p>
