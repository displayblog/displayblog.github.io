<blockquote><p>We merged, we invented, we kicked ass, and we had fun, but then things got a little complicated.</blockquote></p>
<p>Getting integrated into a huge company like HP will no doubt make things a little complicated. Sood will be "directly involved in a product pipeline again." With VooDoo PC gone and Dell's Alienware sucking I look forward to something fresh in the boutique computing space.</p>
