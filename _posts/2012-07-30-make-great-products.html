<p><a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-07/30/jonathan-ive-revenue-good-design">Wired.co.uk</a>: Jonathan Ive at the British Embassy's Creative Summit:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are really pleased with our revenues but our goal isn't to make money. It sounds a little flippant, but it's the truth. Our goal and what makes us excited is to make great products. If we are successful people will like them and if we are operationally competent, we will make money.</blockquote></p>
<p>Make great products, and the money will follow.</p>
