<p><a href="http://neasia.nikkeibp.com/neasia/004522">Nikkei Electronics Asia</a>: Low Temperature Poly Silicon (LTPS) provide better electron mobility than Amorphous Silicon (a-Si) and is used for high-resolution displays. Sony's TR series and TX series notebook computers use LTPS screens developed by TMDisplay. However, both LTPS and a-Si currently use complicated, expensive and low efficiency processes such as photolithography and vacuum pumps.</p>
<p>The impetus for the display industry is to move toward simpler and less expensive processes. Inkjet technology has been gaining traction and Seiko Epson with JSR has hit a cord. The two companies, by developing a liquid Si material, are capable of manufacturing a LTPS display with inkjet technology. Polysilane, the liquid Si material, is central: SiH2 is coated on a glass substrate that is heated to 540C that burns off the H2 but leaves the Si. Up until this development, SiH2 was not used as a liquid due to its insolubility in organic solvents. The two companies mixed cyclo-penta-silane (CPS) that allows the SiH2 to dissolve in organic solvents.</p>
<p>Using inkjet technology to manufacture displays reduce the complexity and cost resulting in faster production and lower prices. This development, if caught on, will not be good for vacuum pump machine manufacturers, and companies related to developing tools and equipment for photolithography.</p>
