<p>Inklet from Ten One Design converts the multitouch trackpad in the MacBook into a drawing tablet. The company does that adding pressure sensitivity when using Pogo Sketch. You type control-option-i to get it started and off you go. Inklet also knows to reject touches by your palm while drawing. Another neat feature allows you to use multitouch gestures to resize the workspace. Nifty. Price is quite affordable at US$24.95.
