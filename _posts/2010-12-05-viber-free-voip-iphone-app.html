<p><a href="http://www.viber.com/">Viber</a> is a free VoIP iPhone app that works over 3G, and WiFi of course. There is no registration: just enter your mobile phone number. You also get free SMS.</p>
<blockquote><p>[...] and the sound quality is much better than a regular call.</blockquote></p>
<p>Incredible claim, but I don't doubt it since I've experienced many Skype calls that have better quality than regular calls.</p>
<p>Calls between Viber users are free so you'd want your friends to get on Viber, too. But there is a catch: it seems Viber sends a SMS invitation to all of your friends. That could get really expensive. Also VoIP uses data so keep an eye on your data usage.</p>
