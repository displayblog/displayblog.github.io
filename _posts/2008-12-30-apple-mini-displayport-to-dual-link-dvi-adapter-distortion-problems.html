<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-3651 aligncenter" title="apple_mini_displayport_to_dual_link_dvi_adapter_distortion" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/apple_mini_displayport_to_dual_link_dvi_adapter_distortion.jpg" alt="apple_mini_displayport_to_dual_link_dvi_adapter_distortion" width="494" height="324" /></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IF252C?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=displ0f-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=B001IF252C">Apple's Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI adapter is $99</a>. It is VERY expensive. For that kind of price it should do a lot more than just connect your box to a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=30"-lcd-monitor">30" LCD monitor</a>. Well, maybe that's expecting a bit too much. This expensive cable is not even doing what it is suppose to. Users have found that there is periodic distortions of the display when using the Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI adapter. Just look at the image above (courtesy <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/profile.jspa?userID=253478">Wes Plate</a>).</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I would be extremely frustrated, at the very least, if this happened to me: I just purchased a brand new MacBook Pro. Fast, shiny, single slab of aluminum! Try to connect to my awesome 30" LCD monitor with a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=2560-x-1600">2560 x 1600</a> pixel format. Realize it is NOT possible. Get ripped off and order the $99 Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter. Wait wait and then wait some more. Finally get it in the mail. Rip out the cable and connect the MBPro to the 30" monitor. And revel at the beauty. Aaaah... this is how it was meant to be! And then after a while of computing bliss... DISTORTION.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are two Apple Discussions threads:</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=8680802">http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=8680802</a><br />

</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Users have been able to temporarily fix he problem by disconnecting the USB connection and then reconnecting it. Yes, the adapter has both a Mini DisplayPort connection AND a USB connection that you have to connect to the MBPro. How lame. The disconnect-reconnect is a temporary fix and you will eventually have a distorted screen again. It looks there is some timing issue involved with either the adapter and/or the Mini DisplayPort connection on the MBPro.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is what Apple is telling customers to do:</p></p>
<ul>
<li>Update all software and firmware related to your hardware.</li>
<li>Delete Library-->Preferences-->com.apple.windowserver.plist (I don't know why)</li>
<li>Delete User --> Library --> Preferences --> ByHost --> com.apple.windowserver.xxxxx.plist</li>
<li>Reset PRAM by pressing Command-Option-P-R and reboot the computer.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you are having similar problems, Apple seems to be sending out replacement units.</p></p>
