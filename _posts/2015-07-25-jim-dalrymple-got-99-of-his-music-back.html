<p><a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2015/07/24/i-got-my-music-back-at-least-most-of-it/">Jim Dalrymple</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s been an interesting and confusing day. I arrived at Apple this morning to talk to them about my issues with Apple Music and to hopefully fix my problems. The good news is that I have about 99 percent of my music back.</blockquote></p>
<p>This is good news. But the following is not:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple said my music was never deleted and that it was in the cloud the entire time. Before Apple Music, iTunes Match would show me all of my songs&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;matched, uploaded, and purchased. However, if you turn off iCloud Music Library and Apple Music, iTunes Match will only show your purchased content now. There is no way to separate iTunes Match from the iCloud Music Library. Before, you would turn off iTunes Match&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;now you would turn off iCloud Music Library.</blockquote></p>
<p>iCloud Music Library. iTunes Match. Apple Music. Three different brands doing three different things, and confusing everyone. (Forgot: There's Beats Music, too.)</p>
<blockquote><p>At this point, I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m just glad to have most of music back, but I still have no idea what happened to the other songs, for sure.</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple's got work to do if songs are ripped into bits as they are being classified as part of one system or another. </p>
<p>Here's an idea: How about branding the experience of listening to music &mdash; the ones we own <em>and</em> the ones we don't &mdash; on Macs and iOS devices as simply Music?</p>
