<p>This is Part Ic to Display Showdown: Nexus One, part of the <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/02/11/display-showdown-nexus-one-vs-iphone-3gs/">Display Showdown: Nexus One vs. iPhone 3GS</a></em> series. Part Ic looks at Brightness Decrease with Viewing Angle, Contrast Ratio Shift with Viewing Angle, and Color Shift with Viewing Angle.</p>
<p>Brightness Decrease with Viewing Angle</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Nexus One exhibited a significant decrease in brightness, unusual for an OLED display, which should show no viewing angle effects. Tests showed a 28% decrease to 166 cd/m&Acirc;&sup2;&Acirc;&nbsp;in brightness at 30&Acirc;&deg; viewing angle. The most likely culprits are the touch layer and the anti-reflection (AR) layer.</p><br />
Contrast Ratio Shift with Viewing Angle</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The contrast ratio shift was not visually significant due to the extremely high contrast ratio enabled by near-zero brightness when black. This is excellent.</p><br />
Color Shift with Viewing Angle</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Red shifted the most and became orange, by &Icirc;&rdquo;(u'v')=0.0262, which is visibly quite noticeable. Blue shifted by 0.0169 and green shifted by 0.0107. According to Dr. Soneira these numbers are surprisingly large and most likely due to the two layers: touch and AR.</p><br />
Although most smartphone users will be looking straight at the display, scientific measurements and tests point to significant shift in color and brightness for the OLED used in the Nexus One. If color is important to you make sure you're looking dead on.</p>
