<blockquote><p>When viewed head-on, the Arc's display is actually above average in terms of contrast and color saturation, but we found ourselves getting annoyed with its dull appearance while looking at it lying on our desk. Viewing comfort at oblique angles hasn't tended to be a pain point for smartphones so far, but as they grow increasingly larger and fancier, it's becoming more important.</blockquote></p>
<p>Sony Ericsson calls this so-so 4.2-inch 16:9 display the Reality Display. Maybe a bit too much reality? The 854x480 pixel format is good enough for a resolution of 233 PPI, but poor off-axis viewing angles just doesn't cut it in this competitive smartphone industry filled with excellent displays.</p>
