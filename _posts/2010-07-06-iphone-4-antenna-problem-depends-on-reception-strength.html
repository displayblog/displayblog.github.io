<p>Daring Fireball's <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/07/05/consumer-reports-iphone-4">John Gruber</a> commenting on Consumer Reports' iPhone 4 signal testing results:</p>
<blockquote><p>So we seem to be nearing consensus. With strong reception, bridging that antenna gap doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t matter much. With weak reception, bridging that gap is enough to lose the signal.</blockquote><br />
OK... my question is: How do you know whether you're in a place with strong reception or a weak one? <a href="http://blogs.consumerreports.org/electronics/2010/07/apple-iphone-4-dropped-calls-faulty-antennas-design-death-grip-iphone4-att-field-tests-results-experiences-consumer-reports-s.html">Mike Gikas</a> from Consumer Reports had three or four bars, which I think all of us would consider at least not weak, before going down to zero bars in about five seconds. All thanks to putting his pinky on "the spot" (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/06/29/the-iphone-4-spot/">The iPhone 4 Spot</a></em>). I guess help is on the way: Apple is working on a patch that will help you get a better feel for reception strength in your area (read <em><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/07/02/iphone-4-reception-issue-signal-formula-error/">iPhone 4 Reception Issue: Signal Formula Error?</a></em>). So my recommendation, for now, is to find out whether you're living, working, commuting in areas that have weak or strong receptions. If they are weak then I would hold off on the iPhone 4, no matter how painful that could be. Unfortunately, I live in an area with very weak AT&amp;T signals. Pooey.</p>
