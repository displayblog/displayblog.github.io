<blockquote><p>While revenue is only one measure of the size of a company and Microsoft's high profit margins achievable through its primary focus on software mean that it still generates more profit than Apple...</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple's revenues were US$20.34 billion; Microsoft's were $16.2 billion. Revenues do matter but profits matter more: Microsoft made a total of $5.41 billion in profits versus Apple's $4.31 billion. Still, Apple's meteoric rise is impressive.</p>
