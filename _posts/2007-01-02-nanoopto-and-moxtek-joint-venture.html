<p>NanoOpto is a company that is developing high-quality, low-cost optical components and systems by using a proprietary nano-fabrication technology. MOXTEK manufactures wire-grid polarizers for rear-projection TVs (RPTVs) using its own nano-fabrication method. NanoOpto and MOXTEK announced they will jointly develop a suite of nanotechnology-based optical products for consumer markets. MOXTEK has a manufacturing capability of 25,000 8" wafers of nano-photonics materials and devices per month. Initially, the two companies will focus on addressing the porjection display. What does this mean? I'm not quite sure, but my guess is improvements in color in RPTVs.</p>
