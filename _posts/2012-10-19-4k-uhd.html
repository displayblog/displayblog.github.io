<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/19/3527162/sony-to-use-4k-uhd-nomenclature">The Verge</a>. Sony:</p>
<blockquote><p>Just a quick note to let you know that as a leader at the forefront of new display technology such as HD, 3D and beyond, Sony lauds the CEA&acirc;&euro;&trade;s efforts to come up with a common language to describe the next generation high-definition technology. However, to ensure clarity for consumers and delineate between today&acirc;&euro;&trade;s and tomorrow&acirc;&euro;&trade;s technology, Sony will continue to use the 4K moniker for its products and will market its future products as 4K ultra high-definition (4K UHD).</blockquote></p>
<p>CEA wants UHD. Sony prefers 4K. Consensus driven Sony brings the two together: 4K UHD. Diplomatic, yes. But folks will call 4K simply 4K.</p>
