<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/08/09/rim-blackpad-tablet-priced-at-499-when-it-ships-in-november/">Engadget</a>: The rumored RIM BlackPad will sport a 9.7-inch display, Bluetooth, WiFi, two cameras (one front-faced the other rear-facing). Quanta will be building the BlackPad for RIM. Manufacturing is scheduled to ramp to two million units in September. Retail launch is planned for November. Eight million units are planned for 2011. The display size isn't surprising and neither is the price? US$499.</p>
