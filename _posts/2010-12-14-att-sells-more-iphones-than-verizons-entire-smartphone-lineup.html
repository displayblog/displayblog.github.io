<p>Horace Dediu at <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2010/12/13/verizon-strikes-out/">asymco</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The data shows that Verizon sold, on average, about 3 million smartphones per quarter during the first nine months. That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s about 1 million a month. That was based on three platforms, six vendors and widespread promotion.</p>
<p>The iPhone sold almost 4 million a quarter over the same time period.</blockquote></p>
