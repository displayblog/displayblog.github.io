<p>Now there are a few things to keep in mind when we discuss OLEDs. Unlike LCDs, OLEDs consume power only for active pixels. So when the pixel is black, the OLED pixel is off.

Now, what does the OLED Pentile Matrix do to help? <a id="more"></a><a id="more-4896"></a></p>
<p>Samsung's OLED PenTile Matrix increases the size of the OLED pixel by up to 33%. When the pixel size increases the current density decreases. With that OLED's lifetime can be significantly increased. Have a look at the diagram above. You can see that the OLED PenTile Matrix has red and blue sub-pixels that are much larger than the ones seen in the conventional RGB stripe structure. That increased size is what allows for higher aperture, lower current, and longer lifetime. And that's the exact improvements that we need to get smartphones such as <a href="http://www.google.com/custom?hl=en&amp;safe=active&amp;client=pub-1028052232505250&amp;channel=0117441043&amp;cof=FORID%3A13%3BAH%3Aleft%3BS%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.displayblog.com%3BCX%3ADisplayBlog%2520Search%2520Engine%3BL%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.displayblog.com%2Fwp-content%2Fthemes%2FProSense-Grey%2Fimages%2Fdisplayblog_logo_03_thin.jpg%3BLH%3A50%3BLC%3A%230000ff%3BVLC%3A%23663399%3BGFNT%3A%230000ff%3BGIMP%3A%230000ff%3BDIV%3A%23336699%3B&amp;adkw=AELymgWsGOR9j5dmCpDJL2_BS_0Ivnq9iXpPfY3msI0-BtxTnUprCP3dZlKrJlbrJEauQ_EewmJNgEl6QXn5uDVnXITvcny2eyOo1f2aE06hDSTbxJDdL-fBEpAFgn9D49doKGq4X1ReRbObDf-aFwBo9nW-XVFt3kWjkyXMfmKMAU-WWaAd7KOu8YT-7T0QOkQQNCmVYVKZlM9XYmHsI1xCmn4clWzrxg&amp;boostcse=0&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;oe=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=oled+iphone&amp;btnG=Search&amp;cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3Autpr0mvi0e9">Apple's iPhone adopt OLED technology</a>. Imagine an iPhone that is much thinner, lasts quite a bit longer, has incredible contrast and color--better quality than almost any LCD TV.</p>
