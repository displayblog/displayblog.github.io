<p>QinetiQ, Thales, and SELEX S&amp;AS together was awarded a two-year UK Ministry of Defences' contract worth US$16 million to advance thermal imaging (TI) technology for the ALBION program using cadmium mercury telluride (CMT) focal plan arrays. ALBION is targeting the year 2008 to go into operational status. This new program will provider TI technology with higher resolution, greater sensitivity, and lower cost that allow detection, recognition and identification of targets in environments with low lighting  and poor visibility.

<p>QinetiQ originated as one of UK Ministry of Defense's (MOD) defense research laboratories. QinetiQ has had a hand in developing the first powered flight in the UK, the radar, thermal imaging, carbon fiber, LCDs and Internet technologies. In 1991, the UK placed non-nuclear defense research laboratories into the Defense Research Agency (DRA), an executive agency of the MOD. In 1995, DRA formed the Defense Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) after acquiring 11 other agencies and operating units from the MOD. In 2001, the majority of defense and security-related capabilities from DERA was restructured into QinetiQ Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of QinetiQ Group plc.
