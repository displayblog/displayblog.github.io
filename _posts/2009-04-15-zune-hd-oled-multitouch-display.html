<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-5309 aligncenter" title="microsoft_zune_hd_02" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/microsoft_zune_hd_02.jpg" alt="microsoft_zune_hd_02" width="500" height="571" /></p></p>
<p><strong>HD?</strong> So what's the HD about the new Zune HD? It can play HD media from the Zune Marketplace. It also receives signals from HD Radio. Will the OLED screen be HD?</p>
<p><strong>OLED Not HD</strong> Most likely not as that will require at least a 1280 x 720 pixel format on a screen that'll be 4" or less. Quite a bit less. Tave a close look at the picture and you'll see massive borders around the display. Those would make the actual size of the OLED display much smaller than the physical unit. Unfortunate. So 3.5" is probably about the size of the OLED and in terms of pixel format it will be way less than 1280 x 720 in landscape mode.</p>
<p><strong>Windows Mobile 7</strong> There are rumors that Windows 7 (not the mobile version) will be out later this year and so it might be true that Windows Mobile 7 will come out at the same time. If Microsoft can pull that off, that would be impressive.</p>
