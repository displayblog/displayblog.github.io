<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20110913PD202.html">DigiTimes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Large-area panel makers are reducing output hoping to boost slumping panel prices. Among them, LG Display (LGD) has reportedly reduced its 8.5G plant utilization rate, with the possibility of a further cut to 50-70% in fourth-quarter 2011.</blockquote></p>
<p>TV demand continues to be weak. Just look at U.S. national retailer Best Buy's latest quarterly results: <a href="/2011/09/13/best-buy-profits-drop-30/">profits were down 30%</a>. Utilization rate reductions will need to more than offset the decline in demand for big display items like TV. But I would think LGD will need all the manufacturing capacity it can handle with demand for its IPS displays increasing thanks to the iPhone 5 (or iPhone 4S) that will be soon announced and the iPad 2, which is going on strong.</p>
