<p>Autoblog took the 2009 BMW Z4 sDrive30i Roadster for a spin and mentioned this:</p>
<blockquote><p>As with most modern BMWs, between the analog gauges is a red-orange LCD display that displays secondary information like mileage, radio stations and so on. The readout is easily legible except when wearing polarized sunglasses.</blockquote><br />
Of course the information from the red-orange LCD is not absolutely essential when driving, but this seems to be a major oversight by BMW since many who would be driving a convertible like the Z4 would be wearing exactly those glasses to minimize glare coming from the road.
