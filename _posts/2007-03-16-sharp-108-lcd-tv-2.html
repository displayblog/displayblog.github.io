<p>Sharp exhibited its manufacturing prowess by showcasing a 108" LCD TV during CeBIT 2007. The 108" LCD TV panel is produced at the company's G8 fab located in Kameyama, Japan. The G8 fab is the world's largest and only one in volume production. The pixel format is 1920 x 1080, which is quite good. But quite good isn't good enough, especially if you're dealing with a screen that is 108" diagonally! How about a pixel format of 3840 x 2160? That would be similar to having four 54" 1080p LCD panels in a 2x2 matrix. I digress.</p>

<p>Sharp has a history of breaking records in the LCD industry. Back in 1998, Sharp was the first to introduce a 14" color TFT LCD TV. In 2004, the company was the first with a 45", which was built from its G6 LCD fab that is also located in Kameyama, where its G8 is. I think Sharp will be breaking another record with the price of its 108" LCD panel. Most likely the panel will not enter into mass production, but if the company decides to begin selling the behemoth, sources say that it might fetch around $80,000 and be available this summer. Wow.</p>
