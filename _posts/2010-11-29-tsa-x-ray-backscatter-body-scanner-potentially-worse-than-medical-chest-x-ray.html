<p>Jason Bell, a UC Davis graduate student doing research on single molecule biophysics and the biochemistry of DNA repair, shares his views on the safety of TSA's Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) at <a href="http://myhelicaltryst.blogspot.com/2010/11/tsa-x-ray-backscatter-body-scanner.html">My Helical Tryst</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to the TSA safety documents, AIT uses an 50 keV source that emits a broad spectra (see adjacent graph from here). Essentially, this means that the X-ray source used in the Rapiscan system is the same as those used for mammograms and some dental X-rays, and uses BOTH 'soft' and 'hard' X-rays. Its very disturbing that the TSA has been misleading on this point. Here is the real catch: the softer the X-ray, the more its absorbed by the body, and the higher the biologically relevant dose! This means, that this radiation is potentially worse than an a higher energy medical chest X-ray.</blockquote></p>
