<p><a href="http://recode.net/2014/09/03/sony-xperia-z3-headed-to-t-mobile-this-fall-touting-two-days-of-battery-life/">re/code</a>: Sony's new flagship smartphone is the IP58 certified Xperia Z3 and sports a 5.2-inch IPS LCD with a pixel format of 1920x1080. Let's just stop there: both the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/04/22/lg-g3/">LG G3</a> and <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/09/03/samsung-galaxy-note-4/">Samsung Galaxy Note 4</a> feature 2560x1440 displays.</p>
<p>I do like the symmetric front and back glass design of the Xperia Z3; the iPhone 4/4s design is my favorite. The aluminum frame is curved a bit and Sony made the Xperia Z3 thinner: 8.2mm &rarr; 7.3mm (the iPhone 5s is 7.6mm thick).</p>
<p>The camera uses a 1/2.3-inch Exmor RS image sensor and BIONZ image processor mated to a 25mm wide angle Sony G lens. ISO sensitivity goes all the way up to 12,800.</p>
<p>With its 3100mAh battery Sony claims the Xperia Z3 will last a full two days on a single charge. The Z3 comes in white, bronze, silver, and black. One nifty feature: you can play PlayStation 4 games right on your Xperia Z3 devices.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/with-xperia-z3-phone-sony-finally-conquers-us-launch-lag/">c|net</a> Sony confirmed the Xperia Z3 will be available through T-Mobile in the U.S. in the final months of 2014.</p>
