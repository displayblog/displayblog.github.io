<p>It's actually amusing to me that I'm blogging about a 17" LCD monitor that's really not all that special. Sure, I talked about Sony's SDM-HS75, but that monitor has a really nice design. Philips' 17DC? From the looks of it, it looks like any other "Made in China"-look LCD monitor.</p>

<p>The specs are unremarkable as well: 1280 x 1024 resolution, and a 8ms on/off response time. Yowzer... A few "notable" things: Less than industry average power consumption, lead-free design, and a sRGB color space.</p>
<p>If you're going to show a wide aspect ratio movie or music video, it might have been better on a 17" wide LCD monitor, which seems to be on its way back to life.</p>
