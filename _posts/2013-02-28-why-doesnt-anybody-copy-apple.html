<p>Perhaps it is more than a bit difficult to copy Apple. <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2013/02/19/why-doesnt-anybody-copy-apple/">Horace Dediu</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s complex, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s subtle, it defies explanation but it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not magic. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a process that requires a degree of faith and fortitude. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s collecting but ignoring data and trusting judgement when data tells you to move in a different direction. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a lot of willful rejection of conventional wisdom. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s asymmetric approaches to competition. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s art as much as science. And most of all, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a lot of mind-numbing polishing while trusting that only by doing great work is survival even possible.</blockquote></p>
