<p>Now this is crazy. According to the Chinese-language <em>Apple Daily</em>, Chi Mei is planning to cut the price of its own-branded 22" LCD monitor in Taiwan from NT$11,900 to NT$9,990. In US dollars, that's about $300! Chi Mei is also planning to lower prices of its 20" and 19" wide LCD monitors.</p>
<p>With a $300 price tag for a 22" LCD monitor, there really is no other option but to get one! Compared to a $149 17", $199 19", $219 19" wide, or $249 20" wide, the $300 22" is unbeatable. The only thing keeping me back is the Chi Mei brand and whether it will be available State side.</p>
