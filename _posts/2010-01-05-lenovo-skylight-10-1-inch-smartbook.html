<p>The Skylight by Lenovo is an ultrathin 10.1-inch smartbook sporting a 1GHz Snapdragon, Linux OS, integrated WWAN, flip-out USB drive and regular USB port, mini-HDMI, SD, internal microSD, 8GB storage, and 12-hour battery. All of your info is stored on the flip-out USB drive so when you are lucky enough to find another Skylight you can plug in and feel right at home. Chiclet keyboard is a plus but multitouch touchpad isn't quite there yet. The US$499 will make the Skylight merely niche. AT&amp;T-subsidized pricing on the way.
