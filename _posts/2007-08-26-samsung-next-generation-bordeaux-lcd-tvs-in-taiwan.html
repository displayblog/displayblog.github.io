<p class="P1">Samsung recently introduced its next-generation Bordeaux <a href="http://www.displayblog/?tag=lcd-tv">LCD TV</a>s in Taiwan and hopes to see about 15,000 to 20,000 in sales this year. These next-generation Bordeaux LCD TVs have been available in the global market since March 2007&Acirc;&nbsp;and a&Acirc;&nbsp;46" model will be released in 1H'08.</p></p>

<p class="P1"><em>Opinion</em><br />
I'm not sure why it took so long for Samsung to introduce LCD TVs that have been available to the global market since March. I know the Bordeaux line of LCD TVs are very popular in Korea. There are a few caveats though. The 8ms response time is not the best that I have seen and without a <a href="http://www.displayblog/?tag=120hz">120Hz</a> frequency there will most likely be some video blur. The pixel format of 1366 x 768 should be plenty for a long time to come as 1080p content is very hard to come by and in some cases have been shown not to be all that better than 720p. Finally, the price of around $1400 for a 32" LCD TV seems to be quite high. I would think $999 would be tops in the 32" category as of now. The $2271 price for the 40" version is also too high: $1499 would be more inline with pricing trends. Samsung's own LN-T4061F sports a pixel format of 1920 x 1080 (1080p) and goes for just <a href="http://electronics.pricegrabber.com/plasma-lcd-televisions/samsung/m/34766365/search=40/sort_type=bottomline">$1358 via Pricegrabber</a>. I do know that CE prices are generally higher in Asia than in the US but the difference here seems to be substantial.<br />
