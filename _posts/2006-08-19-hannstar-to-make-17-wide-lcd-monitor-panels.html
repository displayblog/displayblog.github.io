<p>Didn't we go through this before? A long time ago, I purchased a Sony LCD monitor that was a 17" wide. It was very stylish, had built-in speakers and video inputs to hook up my PlayStation 2. But the price was out of this world. $1000. It is no surpise that the market didn't support the 17" wide at that price.</p>
<p>HannStar wants to change that. According to Chin-Hao Chou, VP of HannStar, the company will be making 17" wide LCD monitor panels from October, in small volumes. HannStar will supply its own Hanns.G brand and reach 300K-400K units per month by the second quarter of 2007.</p>
<p>Fifteen 17" wide panels can be cut in HannStar's G5 LCD plant. Three more than 17" 5:4 and one less than 4:3 15" panels. Because of this the cost of manufacturing a 17" wide panel isn't that much more than a 15" panel. 15" panels are dirt cheap at a little less than $100 right now. Chou stated that 17" wide panels would be around US$10-15 more expensive. That would put about a $200 price tag on 17" wide LCD monitors. I hope they make it 1440 x 900 resolution and not 1280 x 800 or 1280 x 768. That's just too low.</p>
<p>One other factor that doomed the 17" wide effort a few years back was that the 17" wide looked smaller than a 15" 4:3. Why? Well, it was shorter. The human visual system gauges how big an object is primarily by how tall it is. So the shorter 17" wide LCD monitor didn't fair well against a 15" 4:3 that was taller (bigger) and cheaper, way cheaper.</p>

Hanns.G JW-199DPB 19" wide LCD monitor</p>
<p>Hanns.G already has one of the cheapest LCD monitors out there. For instance, its JW-199DPB 19" wide LCD monitor can be had for a cool <a href="http://dealmac.com/deals/Hanns-G-JW-199-DPB-19-Widescreen-LCD-Monitor-w-DVI-for-185-shipped/128474.html?ref=rss_dealmac_7">$185</a>. So my guess is the 17" wide would be around $150! Very good indeed.</p>
