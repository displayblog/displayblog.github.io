<p>Rene Ritchie, <a href="http://www.imore.com/more-5-inch-iphone">iMore</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Almost <a href="http://www.imore.com/att-announces-q4-2012-results-sold-102-million-smartphones-86-million-which-were-iphones">9 out of 10 AT&T customers bought 4-inch or smaller iPhones last quarter</a> rather than all big screen Android and Windows Phones combined, and roughly <a href="http://www.imore.com/verizon-sells-98-million-smartphones-q4-2012-62-million-which-are-iphones">6 out of 10 Verizon customers did the same</a>. So aside from geeks who keep posting about how they really want it, and shoppers for whom bigger as a feature is always better, Apple might not feel any pressing, mainstream need to add another screen size to the iPhone product line. Yet.</blockquote></p>
<p>Apple's focus on making a single great smartphone is one of the reasons why the iPhone is successful. But the aging worldwide population with less-than-perfect eyesight prefers larger icons. This is a huge market and it might be difficult for Apple to ignore.</p>
<p>iMore reader SockRolid:</p>
<blockquote><p>And wouldn't it make sense to use the new leading-edge technology (possibly OLED) on the normal-sized high-end 4" iPhone 6 and later? Because that's where every cubic millimeter counts. An OLED screen would eliminate the need for LED backlights, and could reduce battery size requirements. Because OLED pixels plus IGZO conductors should be dramatically more efficient than LCD plus amorphous silicon.</blockquote></p>
<p>OLED has a power consumption advantage over LCD only when viewing video. For everything else OLED consumes more power. Another challenge for OLED is resolution: Mass manufacturing 300+ ppi RGB OLEDs is difficult at the moment. And one last thing: The iPhone uses LCDs made with low temperature poly silicon or LTPS, not a-Si.</p>
