<blockquote><p>Apple is due to report this afternoon and if you can find the math that supports the expected numbers on iPhone sales given the reports from the two carriers in front of their numbers I wish you luck.  Apple is "expected" to sell ~35 million iPhones this last quarter.</p>
<p>Well, we have 7.4 million between the two largest US carriers reported thus far.</p>
<p><em>Where did the other 27.6 million sales come from?</em></blockquote></p>
<p>Any ideas? Anyone?</p>
