<blockquote><p>Now we get to the key point. Because it's easy to measure market share &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; much easier than measuring installed base, which requires large panels of people who you interview on a regular, repeated basis. (ComScore does this in the US, where it provides a picture of the installed base of smartphone users that is consistent back to the end of 2009. Its <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press_Releases/2013/11/comScore_Reports_September_2013_U.S._Smartphone_Subscriber_Market_Share">figures for the three months to September 2013</a> show a 51.8% installed base for Android - that's 76.6m - and 40.6% for iPhone - that's 60m. It's not 80% Android; not even close.)</blockquote></p>
