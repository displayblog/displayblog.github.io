<p>Maeil Kyungjae &rarr; Reuters &rarr; <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/03/apple-iphone-larger-report/all/1">Christina Bonnington, Wired</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Thursday morning, Reuters reported that Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s next phone would come with a 4.6-inch display, significantly larger than the 3.5-inch display the phone currently sports.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/22/us-apple-iphone-idUSBRE82L01G20120322">Miyoung Kim, Reuters</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple has decided on the bigger 4.6-inch display for its next iPhone and started placing orders to its suppliers, the Maeil Business Newspaper said, quoting an unnamed industry source.</blockquote></p>
<p>According to <a href="http://news.mk.co.kr/newsRead.php?year=2012&no=180838&url=n">Dong-In Lee, Maeil Kyungjae</a> (Daily Business) new management at Apple is following Samsung and making the display bigger on the next iPhone.</p>
<p>Back to Wired:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Canalys principal analyst Pete] Cunningham said this was a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;noticeable weakness&acirc;&euro; of the device. He expects the next iPhone will have a 4-inch or 4.3-inch display, rather than the 4.6-inch behemoth reported by Reuters.</blockquote></p>
<p>And then:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the least, says IHS iSuppli analyst Francis Sideco, Apple could maintain the current phone&acirc;&euro;&trade;s physical form factor, but push the edges of the viewable display to the limits of the phone&acirc;&euro;&trade;s chassis. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Other competitive smartphones, especially in this tier of smartphone, are definitely trending to 4 inches and above, so the current version of the iPhone is definitely smaller than that,&acirc;&euro; Sideco said.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="/2011/07/07/iphone-5-concept/">I think a larger display that pushes right up against the edges will be a terrible iPhone experience</a>. </p>
<p>Most importantly, <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1166051/macalope_baloney_its_whats_for_lunch.html">The Macalope</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This screen size argument is just another instance of feature chasing. Saying &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Other phones have it so Apple must ship one, too!&acirc;&euro; is just admitting &acirc;&euro;&oelig;I have no idea how Apple designs products.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>Well said.</p>
