<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/12/12/lenovo-ideapad-u400-review/">Dana Wollman, Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The U400's display is exactly what you'd expect to find on a $900, 14-inch system, which is to say it has a reflective finish, 1366 x 768 resolution and limited viewing angles. With the laptop resting on your legs you'll have pretty narrow visibility -- dip the screen forward even a little bit and it'll suddenly become washed-out. Place it farther away, though -- say, on a coffee table -- and you might have better luck. For our part, we were able to follow along with Breaking Bad with the screen dipped forward slightly (but only slightly). Viewing from the sides is doable, too, though the screen darkens soon as you start watching from an off-kilter angle, which means some shadow detail is going to get lost in the mix.</blockquote></p>
<p>I don't mind limited horizontal viewing angles on a notebook all that much. But limited vertical viewing angles? Now that's pretty bad.</p>
