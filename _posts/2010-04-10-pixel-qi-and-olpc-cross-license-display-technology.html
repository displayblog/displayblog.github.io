<p>On March 30 <a href="http://pixelqi.com/blog1/2010/03/30/olpc-and-pixel-qi-sign-cross-license-agreement-for-screen-technology/">Pixel Qi</a> and OLPC signed a permanent and royalty-free display technology cross license agreement. As a result OLPC receives full license to all Pixel Qi's 3qi display technology, more than 70 patents in process and all current and future IP related to multi-mode displays. Pixel Qi will receive full license to OLPC's dual-mode indoor/outdoor display technology that is used in the XO. This is probably the largest blanket technology license of current and future IPs between a commercial firm and a non-profit organization according to Nicholas Negroponte, founder and chairman of One Laptop per Child. The cross license agreement almost means that the next-generation XO will make use of Pixel Qi's 3qi display technology. One of the best features of 3qi is the ability to completely turn off the backlight at which point the reflective display makes use of ambient light, allowing for great visibility even in direct sunlight.
