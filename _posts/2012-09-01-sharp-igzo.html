<p><a href="http://9to5mac.com/2012/09/01/sharps-igzo-displays-on-display-at-ifa-berlin-better-touch-sensitivity-smaller-bezels-galleryvideo/">9to5 Mac</a>: Why is Sharp's IGZO-based TFT LCDs better than a-Si TFT LCDs? Here are three reasons according to Sharp:</p>
<ol>
<li>Thinner Bezels: A typical 7-inch WXGA LCD in portrait orientation has a top bezel of 2.78 mm, a left bezel of 2.55 mm, and a right bezel of 4.7 mm. Sharp's IGZO LCD has a 1.75 mm bezel all around.</li>
<li>Lower Power Consumption: Sharp's IGZO LCD consumes 10%-20% of the power a typical a-Si LCD consumes. Power savings come from improved light transmittance: At an equivalent brightness level the backlight need not consume as much power. And because of the improved electron mobility of IGZO compared to a-Si it takes less to drive the LCD panel itself.</li>
<li>Precise Touch Operations: Compared to an a-Si LCD Sharp's IGZO LCD has a lower level of background electrical interference or noise resulting in more precise touch operations.</li><br />
</ol></p>
<p><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2012/04/13/sharp-commences-igzo-lcd-panel-production/">It has taken a long time</a>, but now Sharp expects volume production of IGZO LCDs to finally commence in Q4'12.</p>
