<p>Ji-hyun Kim, <a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/business/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20110801000672">The Korea Herald</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>More than 27,800 Koreans have signed up to file a class action lawsuit against Apple Korea for breach of privacy to pave the way for a legal battle that may cost the company as much as 27 billion won ($25.5 million).</blockquote></p>
<p>Roughly 1% of the three million iPhone users in South Korea are participating in the class action suit. According to Miraelaw, the law firm representing the plaintiffs, tracking and storing user location violates South Korean privacy laws.</p>
