<p><a href="http://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Sony-benches-OLED-TVs-for-4K-sets">Nikkei</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sony has decided to put commercial development of OLED televisions on ice for now and instead focus on 4K ultrahigh-definition LCD TVs.</blockquote></p>
<p>According to the Nikkei article Sony's market share of 4K TVs in terms of revenue was 20%+ in 2013. Sony plans to release eight new 4K LCD TVs &mdash; that's 40-50% of Sony's total LCD TV lineup, significantly more than 10-20% last fiscal year &mdash; this summer and quadruple sales. Most of the people involved in the development of OLED TVs at its Atsugi Technology Center will be reassigned to focus on 4K LCD TVs.</p>
<p>At this point a 4K TV is just a nice-to-have. The only real 4K content, in the U.S., at the moment is from Netflix, but you'll need new 4K TVs with built-in H.265/HEVC decoders. The broadband bandwidth requirement to stream 4K from Netflix is surprisingly low at 15.6 Mbps, but I would bet there are some compression artifacts. Amazon, Comcast, Fox, and others are planning to start offering 4K content later this year.</p>
<p>My recommendation is to wait until Black Friday and see what kind of deals you can get for a 4K LCD TV. By that time there should be more 4K content available, too.</p>
