<p><a href="http://chronicle.com/article/A-Conversation-With-Bill-Gates/132591/">Bill Gates</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Just giving people devices, that has a really terrible track record. You really have to change the curriculum and the teacher and those things, and it's never going to work on a device where you don't have keyboard-type input. I mean, students aren't there just to read things &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; they're supposed to actually be able to write and communicate, and so this is a lot more in the PC realm.</blockquote></p>
<p>It's quite ironic that the tablet PC, which Bill Gates championed for many years, with keyboard, trackpad, and stylus had a dismal track record in <em>and</em> out of the classroom.</p>
<p>I wholeheartedly agree with Bill Gates that it takes more than just a high tech gizmo to reinvent education, but... a physical keyboard is required to write and communicate?</p>
