<p>The display is a 6&acirc;&euro;&sup3; E-Ink display. The battery is good for 7500 page turns. Because the display requires power only when the image is changed, the slower you read, the longer the PRS-500 will last. PDF, TXT, RTF, RSS feeds and Microsoft Word files are supported. According to <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/09/26/sony-reader-prs-500-hands-on-connect-reader-screenshots/">Engadget</a>, who managed to play with Sony&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Reader, readability is very good and much better than LCDs.<img src="http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.engadget.com/media/2006/09/sonyreadera4.jpg" class="biggie" border="1" height="376" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="425" /></p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.eink.com/products/matrix/High_Res.html">E-Ink</a>, white state reflectivity is 37%, contrast ratio is typically 8:1, viewing angles are 170-degrees, pixels are 2-bit generating 4 levels of gray, and image update times are 1000ms for grayscale mode and 500ms for 1-bit mode. Sounds pretty unimpressive compared to LCD TV specifications, but you have to realize that most of the time this display isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t doing anything and that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s what it was designed to do. For a 6&acirc;&euro;&sup3; display, the Sony PRS-500 has a pretty high resolution of 800 x 600.</p>
