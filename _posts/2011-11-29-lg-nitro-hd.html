<blockquote><p>Taking advantage of LG&acirc;&euro;&trade;s new proprietary True HD technology, LG Nitro HD&acirc;&euro;&trade;s 4.5-inch AH-IPS (Advanced High-Performance In-Plane Switching) display supports resolutions up to 1280 X 720 pixels and offers unrivaled color accuracy, brightness, battery efficiency and performance. LG Nitro HD&acirc;&euro;&trade;s 500 nit display luminance allows for clear viewing in direct sunlight and RGB stripe pixels deliver incredibly accurate true-to-life color rendering.</blockquote></p>
<p>The pixel format on the LG Nitro HD is not "up to" but set at 1280x720. A 4.5-inch IPS with RGB stripe 1280x720. Should look absolutely stunning. Available December 4 for US$249.99 with a two-year agreement.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/12/01/lg-nitro-hd-hands-on/">Joseph Volpe, Engadget</a> (hands-on):</p>
<blockquote><p>Of course, the real standout here is the 4.5-inch screen, boasting a resolution of 1280 x 720 and a Retina display-like 329ppi. Colors on the IPS panel pop and images, fonts and icons appears crisp. Viewing angles were similarly excellent, giving way to no instances of wash out.</blockquote></p>
<p><em>Update 2:</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/12/06/lg-nitro-hd-review/">Engadget's Joseph Volpe</a> in his full-blown review:</p>
<blockquote><p>LG's chosen to outfit the Nitro HD with a 1280 x 720 AH-IPS panel boasting 329ppi that bests Apple's Retina display... and it shows. The screen is simply gorgeous, rendering fonts and icons with a smooth distinction you'll likely take for granted. Colors are vibrant and accurate, sidestepping the over-saturated pizazz typical of rival Super AMOLED tech for a more restrained performance. True, the blacks aren't as deep as what you'd find on a Galaxy S device and you will have to pump up the brightness considerably for readability out in bright sunlight, but make no mistake, this is a top-notch screen with excellent viewing angles. The only glaring flaw is the hit or miss touch sensitivity. In certain instances, it took us more than a few hard taps to jolt the screen into responsiveness.</blockquote></p>
<p>326 v. 329. In a heated battle for #1 the minuscule 3 ppi makes the difference between the winner and the loser, but in the grand scheme of things both the LG Nitro HD and the iPhone 4/4S are winners when it comes to incredible smartphone resolution. The hit or miss touch sensitivity sounds more like an Android problem than anything.</p>
<p><em>Update 3:</em> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/12/7/2613319/lg-nitro-hd-review">David Pierce, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Nitro has a 4.5-inch, 1280 x 720 IPS display, and it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s certainly something to brag about: it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s beautiful, crystal clear, and has super-accurate colors. The Galaxy S II&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Super AMOLED display has a tendency to oversaturate colors, giving them a too-warm temperature, but the Nitro never does that &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; what you see is really what you get. The glass is also slightly curved, so it moves cleanly and nicely into the bezel without any sharp edges or obvious seams; it also makes it friendlier to sideways swipes. Its viewing angles are excellent, with very little discoloration as you get off-center (Samsung&acirc;&euro;&trade;s AMOLED displays start to glow blue as soon as you move to the side).</blockquote></p>
