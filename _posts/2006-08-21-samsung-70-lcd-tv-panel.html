<p>It will be available for order in the first half of 2007 and Samsung is claiming another world's first and I guess a world's biggest*. The * would be the biggest commercially available LCD TV panel in the first half of 2007. Sharp currently owns the title for the largest commercially available LCD TV panel with size of 65".</p>

<p>Samsung stated that the 70" would be a 120Hz unit, compared to the industry norm of 60Hz now. The doubling will enable other technologies to be incorporated to reduce motion blur, which is a problem for LCD TVs due to is hold-type display technology.</p>
<p>How much will it cost? You know the drill... if you must ask... One last thing: I've always enjoyed the classy ladies that introduce some of the best stuff that Samsung has to offer. Until now.</p>
