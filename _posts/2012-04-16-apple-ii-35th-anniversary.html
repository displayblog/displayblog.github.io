<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/04/16/apple-ii-35">John Gruber</a>. <a href="http://techland.time.com/2012/04/16/apple-ii-forever-a-35th-anniversary-tribute-to-apples-first-iconic-product/">Harry McCracken, Time</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thirty-five years ago, on April 16 and 17, 1977, more than twelve thousand proto-geeks flooded into San Francisco&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Civic Auditorium. They were there to attend a new event called the West Coast Computer Faire, and the room brimmed with excitement over a new, futuristic gizmo known as the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;personal computer.&acirc;&euro;¬ù The throngs packed the aisles, marveling at microcomputers and related gizmos from tiny startups such as Cromemco, IMSAI, Northstar, Ohio Scientific and Parasitic Engineering.</p>
<p>One of the tiny startups benefited from having an especially slick booth located in prime real estate near the entrance. The company was called Apple Computer, and a handful of its employees, including founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, were demoing an unreleased machine they called the Apple II.</blockquote></p>
<p>From the 1979 ad above:</p>
<blockquote><p>You don't want to settle for a black and white display. You'll want a computer, like Apple, that can turn any color tv into a dazzling array of color graphics.</blockquote></p>
<p>It's interesting Steve Jobs worked so hard, demanded so much from those around him, and settled with a black and white display on the first Macintosh.</p>
