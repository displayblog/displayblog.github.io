<p>I am not sure why Samsung is continuing to introduce 19" LCD monitors with 1280 x 1024 resolutions. I thought wide was the new thing with 1440 x 900 resolution. But there are some good things about Samsung's CX931B, namely the 5ms response time that should be fast enough to keep up with your point and shooting. The CX931B has a 700:1 contrast ratio and 300 cd/m2 of brightness. The 19" LCD monitor goes for 360,000 won or around $382. Kind of expensive if you asked me.</p>

<p>Now if Samsung announced a CX931BW as in a wide version of the CX931B with the same performance specifications, there would be a bit more enthusiasm from me. That's just my opinion.</p>
