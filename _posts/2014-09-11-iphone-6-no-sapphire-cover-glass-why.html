<p>Matt Margolis, <a href="http://wallstreetforensics.com/sapphire-screens-miss-apple-iphone-6-launch-weeks/">Wall Street Forensics</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The plan as of a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;weeks ago&acirc;&euro;¬ù was to include a sapphire covered iPhone 6 in yesterday&acirc;&euro;&trade;s launch. The issue that emerged is that the finishers were still having trouble creating the sapphire edges and yields were only at 25% or less.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>I have been told the issue was not on GT&acirc;&euro;&trade;s side of the house but solely resides within the finishers involved in the process (Biel and Lens Tech).</blockquote></p>
<p>Perhaps next year, with the iPhone 6s.</p>
