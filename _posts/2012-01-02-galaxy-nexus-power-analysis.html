<p><em>via</em> <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/01/nexus-power/">Ben Brooks</a>. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/nystt/galaxy_nexus_power_analysis_why_chargers_cant/">REDDIT user iansmith6</a> ran some tests on his Galaxy Nexus. USB power into the Galaxy Nexus is ~4.5W. Power consumption by Google Maps: 4W peaking at 5.1W. Brooks:</p>
<blockquote><p>And that, folks, is how you drain a cellphone battery while it is attached to a charger.</blockquote></p>
<p>By the way, in airplane mode with only a bright white solid color showing the Galaxy Nexus consumes 2.9W. OLED consumes a <em>lot</em> of power displaying white so if you're an owner make everything as dark colored as possible.</p>
