<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/9/3146337/sharp-dell-settlement-lcd-lawsuit">Aaron Souppouris, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sharp has agreed to pay $198.5 million to Dell and two other companies that filed a lawsuit regarding its TFT business in North America and Europe. It's unclear at present which companies are involved and what the lawsuit pertained to, but it seems likely that it's related to the accusations that Toshiba, Samsung, LG, Sharp, and Chungwa Picture Tubes colluded to fix LCD prices.</blockquote></p>
<p>I would hate to be in LCD procurement at Dell and have to source from Sharp.</p>
