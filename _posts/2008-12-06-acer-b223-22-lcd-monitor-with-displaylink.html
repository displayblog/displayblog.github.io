<p><a href="http://www.electronista.com/articles/08/12/05/acer.22.inch.usb.monitor/">Electronista</a>: On December 5, 2008, DisplayLink and Acer announced the B223, a 22" LCD monitor that sports DisplayLink technology. DisplayLink allows LCD monitors to be connected via USB. Using DisplayLink's DL-160 network display chip, you can connect up to <strong>six</strong> Acer B223 LCD monitors using a standard USB 2.0 connection. It is also plug-and-play meaning no tinkering around with the settings and wasting your valuable time. You get 32-bit true-color graphics and can run Windows Vista with the Aero interface. The B223 features a 1680x1050 pixel format and a decent response time of 5ms. Although the hefty price might be a turnoff think of it this way: if you're thinking of running six LCD monitors that would require three graphics cards and that can get expensive let alone a pain to setup.</p>
