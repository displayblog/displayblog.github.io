<p><a href="http://www.biosmagazine.co.uk/article.php?id=6159">BIOS Magazine</a>: The Fujitsu Amilo 3540, as the title states, is quite the stylish notebook PC. The dual tone, high contrast, black and white works quite well to convey a sense of high-tech modernism, but without going overboard. Although specification information is a bit lacking, the Amilo 3540 sports a Centrino 2 based CPU, which should be fast enough for all your multimedia needs. The largish 15.4-inch wide TFT LCD with a pixel format of 1280x800 (?) should be easy on the eyes, but a bit heavy to lug around if you're the jet-setting type. A+ LCD panels and a gallery after the jump.</p>
<p>One interesting thing that was mentioned in the BIOS Magazine article was that Fujitsu Siemens use A+ LCD panels for all of its AMILO notebooks. What this means is that in terms of LCD quality, Fujitsu Siemens takes the best of the batch: no mura, no dead pixels, no light un-uniformity, etc. You can be comforted with the knowledge that the LCD will be top-notch if you grab an AMILO from Fujitsu.</p>
