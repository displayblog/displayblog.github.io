<p>Apple bought Quattro Wireless, a mobile advertising company. The best online advertising platform company is Google and is due to the company having the world's most popular search engine. So my simple understanding is: for Apple to become a formidable mobile advertising platform, my guess is the company needs to have a popular mobile search engine. And what better device to start such a search engine than on the world's most popular smartphone: the iPhone.</p>
