<blockquote><p>Later, in a discussion of how he felt his writing and sense of story had gotten better with age, Sorkin pivoted back to his Jobs script: &acirc;&euro;&oelig;One of the things that really excites me about <em>Steve Jobs</em> is, it is one of the very few times I ended up writing what I set out to write when I began. It's an incredibly satisfying feeling.&acirc;&euro;¬ù</blockquote></p>
