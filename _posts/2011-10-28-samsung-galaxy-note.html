<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/28/samsung-galaxy-note-review/">Zach Honig, Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>1280 x 800 pixels in a smartphone display is quite a feat, and it's just as impressive to behold as it sounds. The Note's 5.3-inch Super AMOLED screen is incredibly bright, vibrant and detailed, thanks to its 285ppi resolution.</blockquote></p>
<p>1280x800 is unique for smartphones. I'm surprised Samsung broke away from 16:9.</p>
<p>What is the correct method of calculating resolution (as in ppi) for PenTile Matrix displays?</p>
<p>Pixels on a PenTile Matrix display are not hardwired pixels but virtual pixels: a pixel can be made up of 2x1 or 2x2 sub-pixels. And those sub-pixels can be made up of RG, BG, GR, GB or RGxBG, GRxGB, BGxRG, GBxGR.</p>
<p>Is 285 ppi accurate for the 5.3-inch RGBG Super AMOLED display? In light of virtual pixels is there a better method of measuring resolution?</p>
