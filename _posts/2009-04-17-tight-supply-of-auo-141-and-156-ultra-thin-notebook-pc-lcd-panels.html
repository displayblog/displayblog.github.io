The largest LCD manufacturer in Taiwan produces ultra-thin 14.1" and 15.6" LCD panels. <a href="http://www.google.com/custom?hl=en&amp;safe=active&amp;client=pub-1028052232505250&amp;channel=0117441043&amp;cof=FORID%3A13%3BAH%3Aleft%3BS%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.displayblog.com%3BCX%3ADisplayBlog%2520Search%2520Engine%3BL%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.displayblog.com%2Fwp-content%2Fthemes%2FProSense-Grey%2Fimages%2Fdisplayblog_logo_03_thin.jpg%3BLH%3A50%3BLC%3A%230000ff%3BVLC%3A%23663399%3BGFNT%3A%230000ff%3BGIMP%3A%230000ff%3BDIV%3A%23336699%3B&amp;adkw=AELymgV_huD3w-hivy-vbWr60kwYqj_Wqa13AUjzscxuZxInAig54J2iWOY1NJMJP8Lf5eFwlWNiBmH2d77czVR46Sc7roamupf9AEOh1SyzgVvCcC4pVxAKr-k91nAoJPlOjGt7uxw4I2zIN7sGAFpy82NkcxKfBUbHauZp913EpN4Usw6M--wJp_xnjmwmF2ZS2UvD2vdiUGKhmNdHCABnWX1xVZczog&amp;boostcse=0&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;oe=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=acer&amp;btnG=Search&amp;cx=partner-pub-1028052232505250%3Autpr0mvi0e9">Acer</a> wants a lot of them to integrate into its upcoming CULV CPU-based notebooks. The 14.1" and 15.6" have 16:9 aspect ratios, like TVs.</p>
<p><strong>Chicken &amp; Egg Problem</strong> AUO does not want to put more capacity into manufacturing these ultra-thin LCD panels geared for notebook PC applications because there isn't a lot of demand for them. But there is demand. From Acer. Maybe AUO is waiting for more companies to break down their doors.</p>
<p><strong>Will Be Better</strong> Only 120,000 units of 14.1" 16:9 LCD panels were shipped in March. And just 50,000 15.6" 16:9 panels were shipped out last month from AUO. The LCD supplier will be almost doubling its capacity for these LCD panels in April to over 300,000 units. If Acer's recent trends are any indication, I'm sure AUO will be able to sell most of the 14.1" and 15.6" LCD panels that it produces.</p>
