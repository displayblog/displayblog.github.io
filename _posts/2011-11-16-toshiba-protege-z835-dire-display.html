<p><a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/5088/toshiba-portege-z835-a-new-ultrabook-appears/5">Dustin Sklavos, AnandTech</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>None of these notebooks we've tested are particularly big winners here, but it's stunning just how poor the Z830 turns out to be.</blockquote></p>
<p>Out of nine notebooks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contrast Ratio: 191:1 (#6)</li>
<li>White Level: 195 nits (#7)</li>
<li>Black Level: 1.81 nits (#8)</li>
<li>Delta E: 2.87 (#6)</li>
<li>Color Gamut (Adobe RGB 1998): 39.7% (#7)</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>The Protege Z835 didn't come in dead last on any of the comparisons. For instance, the ASUS Zenbook UX21 had horrible black levels at 2.71 nits. Absolutely dead last.</p>
<blockquote><p>Thankfully viewing angles aren't completely awful. [...] It's still a pretty lousy screen, but it'll get the job done at least.</blockquote></p>
<p>Not if you're on a plane. A US$879 ultrabook with a lousy screen? Pass.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/11/18/toshiba-portege-z835-review/">Dana Wollman, Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Granted, TN displays in general don't offer great viewing angles, but they seem particularly narrow here. If you look at the display head-on with the brightness cranked up, you'll enjoy pleasant colors and crisp-enough detail. Dip the lid forward, though, or watch from the sides and you'll see the picture become washed out with more severe contrast.</blockquote></p>
