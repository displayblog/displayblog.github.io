<p>[ <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/01/att-ceo-wont-join-tim-cook-in-fight-against-encryption-backdoors/">Ars Technica</a> ] Jon Brodkin:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it is Silicon Valley&rsquo;s decision to make about whether encryption is the right thing to do,&rdquo; Stephenson said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. &ldquo;I understand [Apple CEO] Tim Cook&rsquo;s decision, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s his decision to make.&rdquo;</blockquote><br />
In <a href="http://displayblog.com/2016/01/19/tim-cook-shows-courage-on-encryption/">Tim Cook Shows Courage on Encryption</a> I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tim Cook is against designing in special backdoors for law enforcement.</blockquote><br />
Here's a doozy&nbsp;<em>via</em> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/01/21/att-nsa">John Gruber</a> about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/us/politics/att-helped-nsa-spy-on-an-array-of-internet-traffic.html">a New York Times article back in August 2015</a> reporting on AT&amp;T's 'extraordinary' relationship with the National Security Agency:</p>
<blockquote><p>The National Security Agency&rsquo;s ability to spy on vast quantities of Internet traffic passing through the United States has relied on its extraordinary, decades-long partnership with a single company: the telecom giant AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>While it has been long known that American telecommunications companies worked closely with the spy agency, newly disclosed N.S.A. documents show that the relationship with AT&amp;T has been considered unique and especially productive. One document described it as &ldquo;highly collaborative,&rdquo; while another lauded the company&rsquo;s &ldquo;extreme willingness to help.&rdquo;</blockquote><br />
Not surprisingly AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson denies it as 'silliness'. Hmm... I'm&nbsp;on U-verse.</p>
