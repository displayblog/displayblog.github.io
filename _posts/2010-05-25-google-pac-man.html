<a href="http://www.google.com/pacman/">Google PacMan</a> is just as fun to play as the original but be careful of the G and the e. The sound uses Flash; animation and controls via JavaScript. Oh, and there's an <a href="http://twitter.com/ginatrapani/status/14443226532">Easter egg</a> to unlock Ms. Pac-Man. According to <a href="http://blog.rescuetime.com/2010/05/24/the-tragic-cost-of-google-pac-man-4-82-million-hours/">The Rescue Time Blog</a> the world smiled, reminisced and had fun for 4.82 million hours playing this timeless game, though slightly modified, on launch day, Pac-Man's 30th anniversary. via <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/05/21/pacman-google">Daring Fireball</a></p>
