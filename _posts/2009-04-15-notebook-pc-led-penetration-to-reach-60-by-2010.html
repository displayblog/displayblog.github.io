<p><strong>$$$</strong> LED backlights cost about 70% more than CCFL backlights mainly due to licensing costs and the added steps to ensure brightness consistency across the LCD.

<p><strong>Green With Benefits</strong> There are many reasons why the backlight market is shifting from CCFL to LED. One is to get rid of mercury. CCFL technology depends on trace amounts of mercury. But mercury is a toxic material that has been polluting our ecosystem. LED technology, on the other hand, does not have mercury. Another reason why LED is favored is because it allows thinner LCDs. For notebook PCs thinner and lighter is better. LEDs also consume less energy so notebooks can last longer.</p>
<p><strong>World's 2nd Largest LED Maker</strong> Taiwan has 25% market share of LED production making it the world's second largest LED manufacturer. Japan has about a 40% market share and is the dominant player in this market.</p>
