<blockquote><p>The iPhone went retina in the fourth generation; the full-size iPad in the third. Seems like too much to ask for the Mini to do so in its second.</blockquote></p>
<p>I'm not so sure generations is something Apple waits on to bring about innovation. The iPhone went retina when it became viable for LCD suppliers to manufacture 3.5-inch LCDs with a pixel format of 960x640 at certain quantities and at certain prices. The same logic applies to the iPad. I imagine Apple's display group pushing LG Display, Samsung, Sharp, etc. toward mass manufacturing the 9.7-inch 2048x1536 LCD. The iPad went retina when they were able to make the retina 9.7. Apple's products go retina when it is feasible, technically and economically.</p>
<p>Same goes for the iPad mini. When a 7.85-inch 2048x1536 LCD can be manufactured at the quantities Apple needs for the price Apple wants is when Apple will start building retina iPad minis. A retina iPad mini would be perfect and I expect Apple to announce one next year. The competition is already ahead when it comes to the display. Just look at the 8.9-inch Amazon Kindle HD: it sports a pixel format of 1920x1200 and a resolution of 254 ppi. Not that Apple cares what the competition is up to, but to imagine Apple not announcing a retina iPad mini in 2013 seems almost an impossibility.</p>
