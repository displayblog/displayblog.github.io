<p>Norman Foster is responsible for the Gherkin in the UK, one of my favorite architectural designs. Now, Foster has been tasked to create Apple's new campus in Cupertino.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.archdaily.com/94061/apple-teams-with-norman-foster/">ArchDaily</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sustainability, is reported to be a large focus of the new campus.   A network of submerged transportation tunnels is in the works and the campus will incorporate some of the Foster&acirc;&euro;&trade;s innovations already implemented in Masdar City, designed by Foster + Partners.  Masdar City is considered the first city in the world without cars or carbon emissions (capacity 50,000).</blockquote></p>
