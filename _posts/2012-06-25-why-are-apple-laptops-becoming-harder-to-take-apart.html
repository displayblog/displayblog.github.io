<blockquote><p>There are a lot of tradeoffs that go into product design. When it comes to laptops, there are capabilities (display resolution, processor speed, storage space, battery life, and so on), size and weight, cost, and upgradeability. Apple seems to have gotten the impression that upgradeability is the factor that people care about the least, and I suspect that they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re right.</blockquote></p>
<p>Why does Apple believe people care the least about upgradeability? Because out of the box there isn't much upgrading that's needed.</p>
