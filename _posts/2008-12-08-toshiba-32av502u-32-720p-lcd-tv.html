<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=toshiba">Toshiba</a>'s 32AV502U is a <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=32"-lcd-tv">32" LCD TV</a> capable of displaying <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=720p">720p</a> HD content. The pixel format is <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=1366-x-768">1366 x 768</a>. The design of the 32AV502U is simple without any obnoxious lights on the front of the TV. The TFT LCD is branded "Cinespeed" by Toshiba and all that means is that the response time is less than 8ms. The 32AV502U is bright at 500 cd/m2 with excellent viewing angles of 178/178. Just from looking at the specifications there are two areas that you will need to look carefully: 60Hz and just 2 HDMI ports. 60Hz is standard on most LCD TVs. The more expensive ones have <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/?tag=120hz">120Hz</a> to reduce motion blur. So if you're into watching a lot of sports make sure to test the 32AV502U out at a retail store before you buy. Second, there are just two HDMI ports. If you have more than two devices to hook up to the 32AV502U, you'll either have to use analog cables (component, S-Video, composite), get a HDMI switch or look at another TV.</p></p>

One reviewer liked it overall but found the buttons on the remote control to be too small: big fingers beware! The other reviewer really liked the picture quality but lamented that most of the video connections were on the back. It is my opinion that most TVs out there have most of their connections on the back. The 32AV502U has a MSRP of $699.99 but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EK5712?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=displ0f-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B001EK5712">Amazon.com is selling it for just $470.92</a> and that's a good bargain!</p></p>
