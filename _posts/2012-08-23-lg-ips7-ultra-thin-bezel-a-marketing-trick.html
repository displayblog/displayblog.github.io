<blockquote><p>The bezel is not in fact 1.2mm as the advertising had lead everyone to believe, and in reality it is 11mm wide! There is a thin outer bezel of 1.2mm thickness but then an inner bezel which makes up the additional width.</blockquote></p>
<p>Marketing trick? I don't think so; LG lied.</p>
