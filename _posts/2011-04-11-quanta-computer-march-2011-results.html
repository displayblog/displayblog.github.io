<p><a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20110409PD204.html">DigiTimes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Taiwan-based ODM Quanta Computer shipped 5.7 million notebooks and brought in consolidated revenues of NT$114.569 billion (US$3.884 billion) for March 2011, its highest monthly figures on record, according to the company.</blockquote></p>
<p>Quanta's NT$114.569 billion is a 91% M/M and 24% Y/Y increase. Thank goodness iPads are eating away mostly at netbook sales. Most corporations as well as consumers are abandoning desktop PCs in favor of notebook PCs, which are just as powerful, more portable, and demands only a small premium.</p>
