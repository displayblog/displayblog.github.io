<p>[ <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/01ba2970-9e70-11e5-8ce1-f6219b685d74.html">The Financial Times</a> ] Daniel Thomas:</p>
<blockquote><p>In January, British actor Eddie Redmayne made headlines around the world as he became the latest in a growing band of smartphone refuseniks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a reaction against being glued permanently to my iPhone during waking hours,&rdquo; he explained, turning instead to an old-fashioned &ldquo;dumb phone&rdquo; handset that could only make and take calls.</blockquote></p>
<p>I have a solution: Buy an old iPhone like an iPhone 4s. Disable 3G. Put every app -- except the Phone and Contacts app -- into a folder. Get a SIM card that gives you only voice. This way you can unglue yourself from your iPhone without having to buy an ugly dumbphone. Plus you'll be saving a bunch of money since you won't be paying for data, which is the most expensive part of your cellular phone bill.</p>
