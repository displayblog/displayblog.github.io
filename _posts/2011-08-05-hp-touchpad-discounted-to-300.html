<p><a href="http://www.webosroundup.com/2011/08/16gb-hp-touchpad-could-be-at-cheapest-price-ever-this-weekend/">webOSroundup</a>: HP is offering a US$100 instant savings on its TouchPad from Aug. 5 to Aug. 7. <a href="http://www.fatwallet.com/static/attachments/105620__100_staples_98980.jpg">Fatwallet.com</a> has a $100 Staples coupon valid through Aug. 7. You'll need to find a local Staples store to get $200 off a TouchPad, but that's a great price even for a not-so-fully-baked tablet.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> SVP and GM of HP's Personal Systems Group <a href="http://vdccnz2prof.houston.hp.com/view_email.asp?eid=10048010&mid=055f0aa5-75fa-414f-9913-9aa980bb0ef7">Stephen DiFranco</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As you may be aware, over the weekend, we offered a $100 instant-savings promotion through both our consumer and commercial channels.  Despite the very short runway, we were pleased with customer response and, as a result, have made the decision to implement a $100 price drop on the U.S. list price of the HP TouchPad, enabling both HP and our channel partners to be even more price competitive in the marketplace.  Effective immediately, the HP TouchPad 16GB Wi-Fi will now be available for $399.99 and the HP TouchPad 32GB Wi-Fi will now be available for $499.99.</blockquote></p>
<p>Drop the price to $299 and I guarantee HP will sell even more.</p>
