<p>For some reason I want to ruggedize my fragile high-tech gadgets, especially my 17-inch MacBook Pro. I bumped into Huzzk: rubberized, inner 4-mm neoprene protection and water resistant sleeve. There are two sizes: 13-inch and 15-inch. Unfortunately none for my 17-inch. The search goes on. Source: <a href="http://www.huzzk.com/Spotz_Sleevie_Uni_15.asp">Huzzk</a></p>
