<blockquote><p>While a number of countries are taking steps to <a href="http://www.petapixel.com/2011/12/16/us-moves-toward-banning-photoshop-in-cosmetic-ad-photographs/">ban the unrealistic Photoshopping of models</a>, Israel has gone a step further: the country has banned the use of underweight models themselves.</blockquote></p>
<p>This is good. Now how about the rest of the world.</p>
