<p><a href="http://samsungtomorrow.com/2293">Samsung Tomorrow</a>: The Learning Hub is Samsung's answer to Apple's iBooks 2 and iTunes U. The company working with thirty educational providers will provide 6000 free and paid content geared toward elementary students to adults. The Learning Hub will be available on Samsung tablets such as the Galaxy Tab 10.1 and 8.9 LTE. This is big: South Korea is a market that will eat up anything if that means better scores, better schools, and better lives.</p>
