<p>On March 25, Chimei introduced its 23LH, a 23-inch LED-backlit LCD monitor. The company expects to launch more "LED monitors" in the second half of 2010. A 21.5-inch version of its high-end L series will be launched as well as three models (20, 21.5, 23.6) for its entry-level V series.&Acirc;&nbsp;More than 30% of the company's total revenues for 2010 are expected to come from LED backlit LCD monitors.</p>

<p>According to DisplaySearch, LED backlit LCD monitors will capture 5% of the worldwide LCD monitor market in 2010 and double to 10% in 2011. I personally think the numbers will be higher. Price premiums will still be there but will be small enough for consumers to weigh in energy savings in addition to the slimmer profiles of LED backlit LCD monitors. Currently there is a shortage of LED chips but it is certain that LED chip manufacturers will increase capacity to meet demand, especially for the second half of 2010.
