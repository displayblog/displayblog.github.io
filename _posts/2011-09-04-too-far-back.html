<p><a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2011/08/high-definition-television">The Economist</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Put another way, viewers cannot enjoy the full benefits of the higher pixel count of 1080p television if they sit any further back than 1.8 times the screen width. At 2.7 times the screen width, they might as well use a cheaper 720p set instead, as the eye cannot resolve the finer detail offered by a 1080p screen at that distance. [...]</blockquote></p>
<p>For moms around the world who desperately want to preserve the health of their kids' eyes a large 720p set seems to be the answer.</p>
