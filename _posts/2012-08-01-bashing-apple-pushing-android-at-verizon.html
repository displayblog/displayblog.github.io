<p>What <a href="http://jeffstern.co/2012/07/17/advice-verizon-wireless-store/">Jeff Stern</a> heard during his 40 minutes at a Verizon store:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;They released the iPhone 4S because Steve Jobs died so they just threw in a couple more features and pushed it out.&acirc;&euro;</li>
<li>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s servers are really small and when you use Siri it normally redirects to Google anyway.&acirc;&euro;</li>
<li>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Every icon looks alike on your homescreen and it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s really hard to find applications.&acirc;&euro;</li><br />
</ul><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>I'll give the folks who work at Verizon Wireless stores the benefit of the doubt and chalk it up to Verizon not training them well enough. Although my gut says they are <em>highly</em> incentivized to sell everything but iPhones, so they do whatever is necessary to sell and pocket their commissions.</p>
