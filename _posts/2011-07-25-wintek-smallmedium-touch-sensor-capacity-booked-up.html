<blockquote><p>Taiwan-based Wintek has had its production capacity of small- to medium-sized touch sensors and modules already booked up during the third quarter of 2011 due to steady orders for touch sensors or modules used in iPad 2 and white iPhone 4, as well as orders for touch sensors used in Amazon tablet PCs to be launched at the end of the third quarter, according to industry sources.</blockquote></p>
<p>It's interesting that the white iPhone 4 is mentioned, as if to imply the touch sensor used is different from the black one. FYI, rumor has it the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2011/07/25/two-finger-amazon-tablet/">Amazon tablet simultaneously recognizes only two fingers</a>.</p>
