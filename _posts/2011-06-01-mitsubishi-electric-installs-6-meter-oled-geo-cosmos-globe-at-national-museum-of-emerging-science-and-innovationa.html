<p>Mitsubishi Electric:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mitsubishi Electric Corporation announced today that it has installed a six-meter organic light-emitting display (OLED) globe at the National Museum of Emerging<br />
Science and Innovation in Tokyo, Japan. The OLED &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Geo-Cosmos&acirc;&euro;¬ù display will be unveiled at the museum as the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s first large-scale spherical OLED screen on June 11.</blockquote></p>

<p>The Geo-Cosmos is an aluminum sphere covered with 10,362 96x96-mm Diamond Vision RGB OLED panels. In terms of inches the square OLED panels are 3.78x3.78. The OLED pixel has a dot pitch of 3 mm. It seems each 96x96-mm OLED panel has a pixel format of 16x16. (Actually, it is 32x32.)</p>

<p>With 10,362 of these 96x96-mm OLED panels the total number of pixels is 2,652,672. In the Mitsubishi Electric press release PDF that was emailed to me, the company states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Projections will feature resolution of more than 10 million pixels, about 10 times greater than that of the LED display.</blockquote></p>
<p>I'm not certain what this means.</p>

<p>Here's a look at the Geo Cosmos OLED globe under construction. The world's first spherical OLED display was created to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> It turns out the OLED panel has a pixel format of 32x32 with the total number of pixels per panel at 1024. With 10,362 of these the total number of pixels for the entire Geo-Cosmos OLED globe is more than one million.</p>
