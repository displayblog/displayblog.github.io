<p>NEC&#39;s SA-SFT IPS panels are one of the industry&#39;s best displays and the company showcased them at SID 2006. NEC introduced a 3.5" TFT LCD panel (320 x 240) with these characteristics: viewing angles are 170 degrees all around; contrast ratios are 500:1 in transmissive mode; reflectivity of transflective displays are 15% (one of the highest in the industry, where typical reflectivity is about 5%). With transflective displays, outdoor visibility as well as indoor visibility is good. This is the world&#39;s smallest LCD incorporating IPS technology. In addition NEC displayed 10-bit displays, 5 megapixel grayscale for displaying x-ray results and small displays geared for ruggedized (3H pencil strength) PDA applications.</p>
