<p>Apple will be holding a "Back to the Mac" event on October 20th, 10am in Cupertino, CA:</p>
<blockquote><p>The event, dubbed "Back to the Mac" invites media to "Come see what's new for the Mac on October 20, including a sneak peek of the next major version of Mac OS X.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/10/13/back-to-the-mac">John Gruber</a> thinks a new MacBook Air will be announced too. I smaller, slighter MacBook Air placed right between the 9.7-inch iPad and the 13.3-inch MacBooks would be perfect. And let me guess what the next OS X codename will be: Lion.
