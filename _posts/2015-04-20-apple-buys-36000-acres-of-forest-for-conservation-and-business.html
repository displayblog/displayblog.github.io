<p><a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/ellencushing/apple-is-buying-up-36000-acres-of-forest-to-preserve-it">Buzzfeed</a>: Apple will purchase two tracts of land in Maine and North Carolina totalling 36,000 acres, which will be managed by The Conservation Fund, an environmental nonprofit, to sustainably harvest for Apple's product packaging. Kudos to Apple.</p>
