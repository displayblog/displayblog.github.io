<p><a href="http://paulgraham.com/tablets.html">Paul Graham</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The iPhone isn't so much a phone as a replacement for a phone. That's an important distinction, because it's an early instance of what will become a common pattern. Many if not most of the special-purpose objects around us are going to be replaced by apps running on tablets.</blockquote></p>
<p>One of those special-purpose objects is the phone.</p>
