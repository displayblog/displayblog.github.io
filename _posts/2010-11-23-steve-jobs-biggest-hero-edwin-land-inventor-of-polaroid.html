<p>John Sculley describes a meeting between Steve Jobs and Edwin Land, via <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2666-the-story-of-polaroid-inventor-edwin-land-one-of-steve-jobs-biggest-heroes">37signals</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dr Land was saying: &acirc;&euro;&oelig;I could see what the Polaroid camera should be. It was just as real to me as if it was sitting in front of me before I had ever built one.&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>And Steve said: &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Yeah, that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s exactly the way I saw the Macintosh.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>Tom Hughes, then Design Director for the Macintosh project, made the meeting between Jobs and Land happen:</p>
<blockquote><p>The memorable part of this was that Steve was meeting someone who legitimately could be, almost uniquely, a mentor for him. And, clearly, they shared an awareness of the importance of good design as it contributed not only to their products, but to their corporate culture as well.</blockquote></p>
<p>I wonder what other well-designed stuff Jobs & Co. will be materializing soon.</p>
