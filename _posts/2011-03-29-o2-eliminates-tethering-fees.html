<blockquote><p>UK carrier O2 has decided to do exactly what we've been asking mobile operators to do for donkeys' years -- it's going to allow users to chew through their data allowance in whatever fashion they like, without imposing artificial surcharges for tethering secondary devices to your phone.</blockquote></p>
<p>A mobile operator making business decisions that actually makes sense to smartphone-toting folks like you and me. Smart, very smart. Now, can we get some of this sensibility across the pond?</p>
