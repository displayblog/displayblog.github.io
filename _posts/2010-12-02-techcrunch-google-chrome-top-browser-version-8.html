<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/30/top-browsers/">TechCrunch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It has finally happened. It took a little longer than anticipated, but Chrome has now passed Firefox as the browser most often used to visit TechCrunch. For the month of November, Chrome is number one for the first time, edging out Firefox 27.80 percent to 27.67 percent.</blockquote></p>
<p>Not only that Chrome version 8 (<a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">download page</a>) is out: built-in sandboxed PDF viewer and 800+ bug fixes. More detailed info at <a href="http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2010/12/stable-beta-channel-updates.html">Google</a>. Of course TechCrunch captures just a small subset of worldwide browsers. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers">Wikipedia</a>: as of October 2010 Chrome's median share is 11.9% while Firefox's share is 29.7%. Internet Explorer still leads with a commanding share of 47.3%.</p>
