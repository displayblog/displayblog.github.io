<p><a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/im-an-apple-junkie-admits-toy-story-director-lee-unkrich-exclusive-interview/66979">Cult of Mac</a>: Mike Bastoli of <a href="http://pixarblog.blogspot.com/2010/06/lee-unkrich-talks-to-film-school.html">The Pixar Blog</a> interviews Lee Unkrich.</p>
<blockquote><p>MB: What are you using now?</p>
<p>LU: My house is filled: Mac Pro, three iMacs, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, MacBook, Mac mini, Mac mini server, two iPhones, two iPads, three iPods, two Apple TV&acirc;&euro;&trade;s, and a graveyard of retired gear.</p>
<p>Do I get to be in the Mac Geek Club?</p>
<p>MB: I think that qualifies you for the Mac Rehab Program (laughs). But seriously, that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a very big club at Pixar, isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t it?</p>
<p>LU: Yes, we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve always been pretty Apple-heavy at Pixar. But not just because of our connection to Steve. Because Apple makes the best products. And in any creative-heavy, artist-driven work environment, you see lots of Apple stuff.</blockquote></p>
