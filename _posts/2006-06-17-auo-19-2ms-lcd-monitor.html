<p>2ms is getting to be very quick indeed! The 2ms response time is the average time it takes for LCs to response to 256 x 256 levels of gray. The panel has a 160-degree viewing angle and a 800:1 contrast ratio. Guessing from the limited viewing angle, this is a TN panel. AUO claims that this is the first TN panel that uses overdrive technology. Overdrive technology over-shoots current to accelerate LC twisting resulting in lower response times. The company states that this panel is RoHS compliant and does not use lead. Looks like playing CS, BF or CoD2 will be that much better with the blazing speed of only 2ms!</p>
