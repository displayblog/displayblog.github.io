<p><a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2013631005_costco09.html">The Seattle Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The chain is phasing out Apple products, per a mutual agreement between the companies, Galanti told The Seattle Times. Costco had sold iPods and pre-loaded iTunes cards for years, although never at huge discounts; and Apple never allowed Costco to sell its products online like other retailers, he said. "In the past couple months, we agreed to wind down."</blockquote></p>
<p>Why would you go to Costco if you are shopping for an Apple product? The Apple Store has the best shopping experience in my opinion.</p>
