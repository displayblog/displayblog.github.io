<p>Sony VAIO EB, EC... I have little clue as to what these model names mean (when will Sony learn?), but if you've been eyeing these models now you can order them with an optional 1920x1080 pixel format. And that option will cost you nothing until October 9th or until supplies last. Source: <a href="http://blog.discover.sonystyle.com/vaio">The Sony Blog</a></p>
