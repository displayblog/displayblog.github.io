<p>Joanna Stern @ <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/27/asus-eee-pc-t101mt-review/">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What can we say? We wanted the Eee PC T101MT to be that perfect tablet / netbook mutt. But for $499, we simply cannot recommend it. Sure, you can upgrade to Windows Home Premium for a bit more cash, but at that point you're spending $550 and still getting a pretty shoddy touchscreen experience.</blockquote></p>
<p>One major focus of enabling touch on a convertible tablet is to make the touch experience as good as possible. Not so in the case of ASUS' Eee PC T101MT.</p>
