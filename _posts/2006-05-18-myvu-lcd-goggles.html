<p>These goggles give you 320*240 pixels, perfect for if you're interested in watching TV shows and music videos that you downloaded off of iTunes and have it synced to your video iPod and you absolutely need to watch it while looking like some kind of high-tech dork that dropped out of a spaceship that came from a planet that has no clue as to what is cool or not. $270 for 320*240 pixel format geekly-looking goggles. Man. The guys over at <a href="http://www.mobilitysite.com/articles/link.php?id=344">MobilitySite</a> is saying this is awesome thinking that you would use this low-resolution goggle to do work on a plane when the guy in front of you reclines his/her seat making your NPBC useless. Hmm.</p><br />
