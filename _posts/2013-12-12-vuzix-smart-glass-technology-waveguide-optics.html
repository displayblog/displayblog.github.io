<p><a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/12/10/vuzix-has-google-glass-like-smart-glasses-but-with-superior-optics/">Dean Takahashi, VentureBeat</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Travers said that Waveguide optics are a revolutionary new way of moving light within smart glasses and are a fraction of the size and weight of conventional prism-based optics. Waveguide optics also deliver a much wider field of view; it uses a 1.4 millimeter window with a tiny input pupil, similar to a fiber optic cable, that is expanded using a hologram in front of the eye. Light isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t bent through bulk material as with conventional optics.</blockquote></p>
<p>Google Glass, but with smaller, superior optics.</p>
