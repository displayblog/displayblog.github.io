<p><a href="http://www.displaymate.com/Tablet_ShootOut_1.htm">Dr. Raymond Soneira</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For Tablets the display is the single most expensive and important hardware component because it determines the quality of the visual experience for every application on the Tablet. There were major differences between the Tablet displays. The iPad 2 was the clear winner in every category. The Asus Transformer was a solid second and impressive for a $399 Tablet. The Motorola Xoom was significantly below the display quality of the iPad 2 and Asus Transformer. It is a cheap low-end poorly calibrated display, which is shocking for the most expensive $599 Tablet.</blockquote></p>
<p>Are you looking for the best visual experience on a tablet? Look no further: DisplayMate's President Dr. Soneira has conducted an extensive array of tests and the iPad 2's 9.7-inch IPS TFT LCD comes out on top.</p>
