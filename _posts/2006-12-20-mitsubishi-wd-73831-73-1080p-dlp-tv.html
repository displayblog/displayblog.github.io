<p>Mitsubishi's WD-73831 is a 73" DLP TV that uses Texas Instrument's largest 1080p DLP chip with a resolution of 1920 x 1080. The WD-73831 uses the company's TurboLight180 lamp system that uses a 180W lamp. Contrast ratio is improved using a dynamic contrast system. In terms of inputs, there are S-Video, Component, DVI, HDMI, and IEEE 1394 (also known as FireWire or i.Link).</p>

<p>The WD-73831 also has a CableCard slot and TV Guide On Screen. There is also a multi-format memory card reader that allows playback of digital photos and music. Even though I am a fan of DLP, for very large application in the 70" range, I prefer LCoS as is used in Sony's 70" SXRD model.</p>
