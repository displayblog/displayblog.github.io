<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/10/tablets-steve-jobs/?intcid=postnav">Wired</a>: Steve Jobs during Apple's fiscal fourth quarter earnings call:</p>
<blockquote><p>7-inch tablets are tweeners: too big to compete with a smartphone and too small to compete with the iPad. These are among the reasons that the current crop of 7-inch tablets are going to be DOA &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; dead on arrival.</blockquote></p>
<p>No surprise here: no 7-inch iPad. DOA? That sounds harsh, until you think about when these 7-inch tablets will be arriving: right around the time iPad 2.0 will be announced. Read <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/09/08/2011-ipad/"><em>2011 iPad</em></a>. DOA? Probably.</p>
