<p>Or the Compaq Presario V3000 series. Same thing. I personally don't know why the Compaq brand is still alive. This reminds me of GM having essentially the same cars across different brands. Look at what kind of mess GM is going through now because of that. I think HP needs to get rid of the Compaq brand. Nobody will really care. Both have a 14.1" widescreen display with 1280*800 pixel format and 16:10 aspect ratio. This is a small but large change from the previous version (HP dv1000) that had a 14.0" 1280*768 pixel format with 15:9 aspect ratio. After HP came out with the popular dv1000 with 14.0" wide, Dell decided that its 14"-class widescreen notebook would use 14.1" wide instead. I guess Dell won since this required an entire retooling to incorporate a different LCD module by HP.</p>
