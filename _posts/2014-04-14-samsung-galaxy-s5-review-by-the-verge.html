<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/4/14/5608222/samsung-galaxy-s5-review">Davie Pierce, The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Build quality may not matter to Samsung, but luckily display quality does, and it shows. The S5's 5.1-inch, 1080p AMOLED display is simply gorgeous. It's a little more intense and vibrant than the LCD screens I'm used to, but the effect is now much more subtle than on previous devices. The screen has near-perfect viewing angles, gorgeous color reproduction, and appears almost to be perched above the phone, games and movies leaping out toward me. Beautiful displays are non-negotiable in a great smartphone, and Samsung delivers.</blockquote></p>
<p>According to Raymond Soneira <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2014/03/31/samsung-galaxy-s5-review-by-raymond-soneira/">the Samsung Galaxy S5 has the best display on a smartphone</a>. To me the display is most important, and the camera is number two. The 16 megapixel shooter on the Galaxy S5 is good, but not great: slightly over saturated colors, inconsistent phase detection autofocus, and soft photos in low light environments according to Pierce. Oh, I almost forgot: the S5 is waterproof.</p>
