<p>Joby's Gorillamobile for iPhone 4 comes with a case with rails that allows you to easily slide the iPhone 4 on and off from the Gorillamobile tripod. The combo is priced at US$39.95, which isn't that expensive considering a standalone case could be just as much, but it seems limited. The iPhone 4 can't be used with any other tripod with this case. This is especially true since I'm waiting for my Glif.</p>

<p>I pledged funding for the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/danprovost/glif-iphone-4-tripod-mount-and-stand">Glif on Kickstarter</a> and soon will be receiving a 3D printed version. The Glif works as a stand (portrait or landscape) as well as a mount for a tripod, including those made by Joby. You can find more information about Glif at <a href="http://www.theglif.com/">www.theglif.com</a>.</p>
