<p><a href="http://allthingsd.com/20111027/motorola-shipped-just-100000-xooms-in-q3/">John Paczkowski, All Things D</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s significantly worse than the 440,000 units shipped in the June period, and even lousier considering Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s iPad sales of 11.1 million in its third quarter.</blockquote></p>
<p>That's <em>shipped</em> into the channel versus iPad <em>sales</em> into the hands of customers.</p>
