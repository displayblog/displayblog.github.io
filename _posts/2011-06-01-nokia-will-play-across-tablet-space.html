<p>Nokia CEO <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2011/06/01/nokia-ceo-elop-nokia-tablet-isnt-out-of-the-question/">Stephen Elop</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m not going to announce a tablet here today. But as a high level point, there&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a connected digital experience will increasingly define what consumers are looking for. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s important for us to play across that space. We have to address that whole space.</blockquote></p>
<p>In simpler terms: Nokia is working on a tablet. My guess is that Nokia will be partnering up with one of five mobile CPU suppliers (Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, or Texas Instruments) to build a Windows 8 tablet.</p>
