<p>Apple <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2009/05/13wwdc.html">announced</a> that Phil Schiller, senior vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing would be leading a team of Apple executives for the keynote at this year's Worldwide Developers Conference that will be held on June 8 at 10AM PDT. Apple will concentrate on iPhone OS 3.0 and a final Developer Preview Release of Mac OS X Snow Leopard.</p>
<p>This news is somewhat disappointing as I was expecting Steve Jobs to make the keynote at WWDC. Jobs is on medical leave until June and more accurately late June. There is a chance that Jobs might be there but just not in a keynoting role. I have a feeling that a small press event in Cupertino will be scheduled a bit after WWDC to unveil some nifty products (i.e. third generation iPhone, netbook, etc.) by Jobs himself.</p>
