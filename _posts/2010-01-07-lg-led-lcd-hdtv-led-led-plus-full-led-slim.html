There's a lot of acronyms in the title, but the one to remember is Full LED Slim: the top-of-the-line LED technology from LG. At the low-end is simply LED, which is an edge-lit LED backlight without local dimming. That makes LCD TVs slim and energy-efficient. Next up is LED Plus that adds local dimming to an edge-lit LED backlight, so it is slim and even more energy efficient and enhances contrast.</p>
<p>Finally, the Full LED Slim is a direct-lit LED backlight with an array of LEDs. Local dimming dramatically improves contrast. And the overall package is ultra-slim. Full LED Slim is slim, energy-efficient and offers the best in terms of contrast. So that's what's behind the <a href="http://www.displayblog.com/2010/01/06/lg-le9500-series-lcd-tv/">LE9500 Series</a> that makes it so hot!</p>
