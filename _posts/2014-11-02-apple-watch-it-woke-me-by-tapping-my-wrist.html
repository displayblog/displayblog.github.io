<p>Nellie Bowles and Dawn Chmielewski, <a href="http://recode.net/2014/11/01/san-francisco-treasure-jony-ive-talks-apple-watch-at-sfmoma-gala/">Re/code</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Just yesterday, somebody was saying, &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Wow, do you know what I just did? I set the alarm in the morning, and it woke just me by tapping my wrist. It didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t wake my wife or my baby,'&acirc;&euro; he recounted. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t that fantastic?&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>That is Jony Ive talking. Fantastic? Yes, but I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t see how this is possible. I was under the impression Apple Watch had a battery life that required nightly charging. Tim Cook on battery life, <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/12/the-mystery-of-apple-watchs-battery-life/">New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We think that based on our experience of wearing these that the usage of them will be really significant throughout the day. So we think you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll want to charge them every night, similar to what a lot of people do with their phone.</blockquote></p>
<p>The only possibility of this anecdote being true is that this somebody Ive is referring to had two Apple Watches: one for during the day and the other for wearing at night. With a battery life similar to that of today&acirc;&euro;&trade;s smartphones there is no way to wear Apple Watch during the day and continue to have it on while you are sleeping. The only way to wear Apple Watch while sleeping is to take it off and charge it during the day. Unless you are more interested in Apple Watch tapping your wrist to wake you up, I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t see anyone regularly experiencing being woken up by her Apple Watch this way.</p>
