<p><a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/two-bears-revisited/">Ben Thompson</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Samsung is being challenged by lower-cost competitors; the company&acirc;&euro;&trade;s average price per phone <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/07/business/international/samsung-forecasts-a-greater-earnings-decline-than-expected-for-end-of-2013.html?_r=0">fell by $30 last year</a>, and its share of >$400 phones slipped from 40 percent to 21 percent. This kept up Samsung&acirc;&euro;&trade;s volume &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; they now account for <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2014/01/28/samsung-now-accounts-for-one-in-three-smartphone-sales/">one in three smartphone sales</a> &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; but the result was their <a href="http://business.financialpost.com/2014/01/07/samsung-electronics-profit-falls-for-first-time-in-more-than-two-years-as-smartphone-momentum-wanes/?__lsa=ee27-06f7">first profit decline</a> in nine quarters.</p>
<p>Apple had the exact opposite problem: the iPhone&acirc;&euro;&trade;s average selling price <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/27/5350106/apple-q1-2014-earnings">jumped</a> from $577 to $636 quarter-over-quarter, and was only down $6 year-over year. Apple also <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/07/business/international/samsung-forecasts-a-greater-earnings-decline-than-expected-for-end-of-2013.html?_r=0">increased its share</a> of the >$400 market from 35 percent to 65 percent. Growth, though, was meager: a mere 7%, despite the addition of NTT DoCoMo and a much earlier China launch for the iPhones 5S and 5C as compared to the iPhone 5.</blockquote></p>
<p>I can see Samsung's top end Galaxy line being compared to Apple, but not the other models geared for customers who want the cheapest money can buy. If I were to choose between the two problems I would pick Apple's problem of selling to those with more disposable income, those who value design thinking, and those who are generally more loyal to brands.</p>
