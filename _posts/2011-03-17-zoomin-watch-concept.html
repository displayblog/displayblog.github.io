<blockquote><p>Love it, love it, love it! The Zoomin Watch is such a brilliant concept, not only is the idea of magnifying nubs on the hands a superb idea, but also the design execution is sleek and sophisticated. Not for a single moment does it look like a watch intended for the Silver Generation&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;if anything it looks like cool wrist gear that will appeal to all generations. Designers, take a bow!</blockquote></p>
<p>The designers are Gennady Martynov and Emre Cetinkoprulu. This Zoomin Watch concept at first glance looks very good. But look closer and as a watch it fails, terribly, for all generations. Quick, what time does the watch show? If you guessed about 2:50, you'd be wrong. It's actually showing 1:50.</p>
