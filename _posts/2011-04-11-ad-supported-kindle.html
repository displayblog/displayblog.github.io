<blockquote><p>The online retailer was set to announce Tuesday that the new Kindle with Special Offers will cost $114 - $25 less than the currently lowest-priced Kindle - and include advertisements on the bottom of the device's home page and on its screen savers. Seattle-based Amazon will start shipping the newest Kindle on May 3, and it will also be sold in Target and Best Buy stores on that date.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Kindle will become even more popular than it is, but by how much? I'm not sure. Drop the price to $99 and it'll be by a lot more. Would a hardcore reader enjoy ads? I'm not so sure. Amazon should also consider an option to pay $25 to permanently get rid of the ads if the user wanted to at a later date. My forecast: a $99 non-ad supported Kindle by Thanksgiving.</p>
