<p>Gizmodo bumped into Michael Dell during the All Things D conference that was held today. Michael Dell was carrying a notebook PC that hasn't been seen before. It was mini, a mini-Inspiron, a potential Eee PC killer. Michael Dell didn't share specs such as OS, pricing or anything. Gizmodo was able to check out the USB ports (3), a card reader, a VGA output, an Ethernet port and the brilliant red color.</p>

<p>From the looks of it, considering that a No. 2 pencil is around 6" and assuming this is a 16:10 LCD, that would put the size of the LCD at around 7". I would guess the pixel format would be 800 x 480 or 1024 x 600.</p>
