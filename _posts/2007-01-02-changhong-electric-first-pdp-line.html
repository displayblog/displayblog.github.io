<p>Changhong Electric is planning to invest 6 billion yuan (about US$768 million) for the construction of its first plasma display panel (PDP) line in China. Changhong is expecting volume production to begin in 2008 with a capacity of 2 million PDPs per year and generating about 8 billion yuan. The main product out of the PDP line will be 50" and larger PDPs. The only comment that I would like to make is regarding the 8 billion yuan annual revenue generation that Changhong is projecting. I would project only 50% of that since by 2008 there will be a couple of LCD guys gunning for the 50" and larger market: Sharp and Samsung.</p>
