<p>USB 2.0-based DisplayLink supported a maximum pixel format of 1600 x 1200 or 1680 x 1050: not good enough if you were running a display with 1920 x 1200 or 1920 x 1080. USB 3.0 changes all of that because there is plenty of bandwidth, more than 10x compared to USB 2.0. Maximum pixel format should exceed 2560 x 1600 or even Ultra Definition at 3840 x 2160. DisplayLink will probably showcase a USB 3.0-based display solution at CES 2010. I hope there is a dongle that has connections for all varieties including: VGA, DVI, HDMI and DisplayPort.
