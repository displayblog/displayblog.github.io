<p>Ambitious. But is it really? Sony is planning a six million LCD TV year spanning from March 2006 to March 2007. Of that, Sony stated in an earlier <a href="http://displayblog.wordpress.com/2006/09/01/sony-kdl-52x2500-52-bravia-lcd-tv-6838-in-october-20/">post</a> it is shooting for 50% of that to be 40" and larger, making the large LCD TV number at three million. Philips' number is one third that of Sony. Not to poo-poo Philips, but do you really like this Ambilight technology? I've seen it at tradeshows, but I don't remember it to be all that spectacular. Instead of giving me a light show, get rid of motion blur, reduce prices for 42" sizes to $1500, make it sport 1920 x 1080 resolution, and increase the color gamut to 100% NTSC. Oh, and one last thing: keep the box black. When that's done, give me a ring.</p>
