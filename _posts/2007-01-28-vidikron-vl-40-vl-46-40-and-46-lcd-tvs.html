<p>Vidikron introduced its VL-40 and VL-46 LCD TVs sporting 1920 x 1080 pixel formats that allow for Full HD 1080p video. The VL-40 (40") and VL-46 (46") join Vidikron's DView line of LCD TVs that feature the company's Imagix video processing and IntelliWide technology that upconverts and scales video signals to fit the 16:9 1920 x 1080 display. Both units have an ATSC tuner that is compatible with NTSC signals, and dual HDMI with HDCP inputs. Contrast ratio is 1000:1 for both units.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, with a gray casing, the two units do not look modern as do silver units and neither do they minimize distractions as do black units. The 1000:1 contrast ratio is certainly nothing to sneeze at but with other brands sporting advanced electronics that increase the contrast ratio to more than 10,000:1, these two Vidikron units seem to be a bit in need. The Full HD 1080p capability is a great feature but cannot be used with the VGA connection as that is limited to just a 1024 x 768 pixel format, a slight oversight as many users will want to combine the use 1920 x 1080 pixels for HD viewing as well as PC-based multimedia use.</p>
