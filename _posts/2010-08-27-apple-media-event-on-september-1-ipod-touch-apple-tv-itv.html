<p>Like clockwork Apple will be having a media event next week, on the 1st of September. Expected announcements are a retooled iPhone 4-like iPod Touch but one that's thinner sporting a Retina Display and two FaceTime-ready cameras. An iOS-based Apple TV (iTV) might also make an appearance. The event will take place at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts Theater in San Francisco, California.
