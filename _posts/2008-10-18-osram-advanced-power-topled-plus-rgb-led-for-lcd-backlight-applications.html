<p>How does OSRAM achieve better brightness for the APTP? The answer is a special lens designed for backlighting. The lens ensures an "absolutely uniform display backlighting". I guess we won't need to worry about brightness uniformity issues on LCDs that use the APTP LEDs from OSRAM. At an operating current of 100 mA the brightness levels achieved by color are as follows: red (14 lm), green (24 lm), blue (28 mW/sr). What is mW/sr? It is milliwatts per steradian. A steradian is a solid angle (cone shaped volume) of measure in 3 dimensions based on a sphere. For example, there are 2*pi radians in a circle and there are 4*pi steradians in one sphere. Blue LEDs are generally difficult to bring about high levels of brightness and that is probably why mW/sr was used instead of lm (lumens). 1200 APTP LEDs are sufficient for 46" LCDs. With regular LEDs a 46" LCD will require 1800 to achieve the same level of brightness.
