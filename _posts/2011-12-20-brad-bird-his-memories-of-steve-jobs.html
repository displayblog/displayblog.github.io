<p><a href="http://anthonycampanella.com/2011/12/20/apple-news-brad-bird-his-memories-of-steve-jobs-video/">Anthony Campanella</a> at the premiere of <em>Mission Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bird, who had been joking with us about our use of an iPhone to record the interview, immediately turned serious and noted that he had many memories, but mostly recalled how Jobs &acirc;&euro;&oelig;didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t settle.&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;He wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t about making something that was going to be cool next week, he was about making something that was going to be cool 100 years from now,&acirc;&euro; said Bird.</blockquote></p>
<p>Brad Bird directed <em>Mission Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol</em>, <em>Ratatouille</em>, <em>The Incredibles</em>, and more.</p>
