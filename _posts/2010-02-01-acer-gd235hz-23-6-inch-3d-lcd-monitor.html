<p>The only thing 3D about the GD235HZ LCD monitor from Acer is that the frequency is doubled from 60Hz to 120Hz. The 23.6-inch monitor works with NVIDIA's 3D Vision active-shutter system (that's $200 extra). The pixel format on the GD235HZ is 1920 x 1080, as expected. The price is a very hefty $399. Since any DLP TV works with 3D Vision (<a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/3D_Vision_Requirements.html">NVIDIA's hardware requirements</a>), you may want to consider a display that's a lot bigger: Samsung's HL-S5086W, which was the cheapest DLP TV I could find on Amazon. The HL-S5086W is a 50-inch 720p DLP TV for just $599.99 (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F2P35K?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=displ0f-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000F2P35K">Amazon link</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=displ0f-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000F2P35K" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />). It is more than twice as large for not a whole lot more. Sure it's 720p but most folks won't be able tell the difference and even though the GD235HZ is running at 120Hz I would hazard to guess that the DLP will exhibit less motion blur.&Acirc;&nbsp;Source: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/02/01/acers-gd235hz-23-6-inch-3d-display-is-ready-for-your-glasses-eq/">Engadget</a></p>
