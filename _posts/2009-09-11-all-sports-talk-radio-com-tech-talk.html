<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6991" title="All_Sports_Talk_Radio" src="http://www.displayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/All_Sports_Talk_Radio.jpg" alt="All_Sports_Talk_Radio" width="210" height="210" />I'll be on the <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/allsportstalkradio">All Sports Talk Radio.com</a> show tonight at 8pm PDT doing the TECH TALK segment. This is a live sports talk radio show that discuss various sports related topics such as the MLB, NBA, NFL, NHL, UFC, etc. The topic will be, "Choosing The Best TV for Sports". Call in (1-347-215-9970) and ask me all your questions. My friend <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Sung Song Sdog co-hosts the radio show and will be giving out a whole bunch of gift cards, a New Era Cap and a lot of other goodies too.</p>
