<blockquote><p>Sony's Reader ebook goes on sale on December 10 at about 20,000 yen ($240) for a model with a 5 inch screen or 25,000 yen for a 6 inch screen.</p>
<p>It hopes to sell 300,000 Readers in the first year and win half the domestic market by 2012, Sony Marketing Japan president Nobuki Kurita told reporters.</blockquote></p>
<p>Competition includes Apple's iPad and Sharp's Galapagos. I wonder why Amazon doesn't offer Japanese titles on its Kindle; if it did Sony might be in for a tough fight.</p>
