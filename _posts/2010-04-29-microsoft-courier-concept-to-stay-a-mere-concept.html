<p><a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=6053&amp;tag=col1;post-6053">ZDNet</a>: Shoot. I was hoping Microsoft had the balls to actually build something exactly like the Courier concept. Frank Shaw, VP of Corporate Communications at Microsoft:</p>
<blockquote><p>At any given time, across any of our business groups, there are new ideas being investigated, tested, and incubated. It's in Microsoft's DNA to continually develop and incubate new technologies to foster productivity and creativity. The "Courier" project is an example of this type of effort and its technologies will be evaluated for use in future Microsoft offerings, but we have no plans to build such a device at this time.</blockquote><br />
Yeah, sure. The Courier concept is one of the best ideas Microsoft has thought up in decades. I would like to meet the guy who made the decision to kill Courier, on a technicality no less: incubation period is over. Here is hoping that HP will pick up where Microsoft left off and make a sweet dual-screen Courier-like "notebook" using webOS.</p>
