<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/12/15/lg-optimus-2x-first-dual-core-smartphone-launches-with-android/">Engadget</a>: The LG Optimus 2X is the first officially announced dual-core Android smartphone, powered by NVIDIA's Tegra 2 CPU running at 1GHz. All that power enables video capture and output <em>via</em> HDMI at 1080p. Wow... 1080p video capture on a smartphone!</p>
<p>The LG Optimus 2X features a 4-inch LCD with a standard 800x480 pixel format. I was hoping for something a bit less ordinary: 960x640 or 1280x720. I'm fairly certain the Tegra 2 CPU would have been up to the task. It will run Android 2.2 when it launches in South Korea, January 2011. Thankfully, a future Gingerbread update is planned.</p>
