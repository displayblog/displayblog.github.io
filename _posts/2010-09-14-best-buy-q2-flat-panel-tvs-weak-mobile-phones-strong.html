<p>AP <em>via</em> <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Best-Buy-2Q-net-income-jumps-apf-3369488825.html?x=0&sec=topStories&pos=5&asset=&ccode=">Yahoo! Finance</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the three months ended Aug. 28, revenue in stores open at least fourteen months edged down 0.1 percent and sales of flat-screen TVs continued to be weak. But that was offset by strength at Best Buy Mobile, which Best Buy has aggressively expanding.</blockquote></p>
<p>The display industry needs to move large LCDs; weak flat-screen TV sales is bad news.</p>
