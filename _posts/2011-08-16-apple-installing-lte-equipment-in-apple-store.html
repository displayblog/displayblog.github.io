<p>Now we've received an image <del datetime="2011-08-17T00:26:44+00:00">the image you see above</del>, which shows some 4G LTE equipment that was recently installed in a major Apple store -- by AT&amp;T, according to our source.</p><br />

<p>Why would Apple install LTE equipment in its Apple Store? Perhaps to perform controlled tests for LTE equipment. This way future prototypes, say a LTE iPhone, can be tested in the wild but be perfectly controlled.</p></p>
